item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form 10-k, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in item 8, and the discussion of risks and cautionary factors that may affect future results in item 1a. risk factors.
description of our company we are a holding company whose subsidiaries and affiliates, and their licensees, are engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, other tobacco products and other nicotine-containing products in markets outside the united states of america. we manage our business in four segments:
our products are sold in more than 180 markets and, in many of these markets, they hold the number one or number two market share position. we have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. our portfolio comprises both international and local brands.
we use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products, net of sales and promotion incentives. our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors, including the volume of products we sell, the price of our products, changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell. mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premium-price brands to mid-price or low-price brands in any given market (product mix). mix can also refer to the proportion of shipment volume in more profitable markets versus shipment volume in less profitable markets (geographic mix). we often collect excise taxes from our customers and then remit them to governments, and, in those circumstances, we include the excise taxes in our net revenues and in excise taxes on products. our cost of sales consists principally of tobacco leaf, non-tobacco raw materials, labor and manufacturing costs.
our marketing, administration and research costs include the costs of marketing and selling our products, other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products (including general corporate expenses), and costs incurred to develop new products. the most significant components of our marketing, administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses.
philip morris international inc. is a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries. accordingly, our right, and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized. as a holding company, our principal sources of funds, including funds to make payment on our debt securities, are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries. our principal wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions with respect to their common stock.

see the discussion of events affecting the comparability of statement of earnings amounts in the consolidated operating results section of the following discussion and analysis.
•   asset impairment and exit costs - during 2014, we recorded pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs of $535 million ($409 million after tax or $0.26 per share) primarily related to the factory closures in the netherlands, australia and canada and the restructuring of the u.s. leaf purchasing model. during 2013, we recorded pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs of $309 million ($202 million after tax and noncontrolling interests, or $0.12 per share) related to the termination of distribution agreements in the eastern europe, middle east &amp; africa and asia segments, as well as the restructuring of our global and regional functions based in switzerland and australia.
on april 4, 2014, we announced the initiation by our affiliate, philip morris holland b.v. ("pmh"), of consultations with employee representatives on a proposal to discontinue cigarette production at its factory located in bergen op zoom, the netherlands. pmh reached an agreement with the trade unions and their members on a social plan, and ceased cigarette production on september 1, 2014. pmi expects to incur a total pre-tax charge of approximately $547 million for the total program. during 2014, we recorded pre-tax asset impairment and exist costs of $489 million. for further details, see the asset impairment and exit costs section of the following discussion and analysis.
•   income taxes - our effective income tax rate for 2014 decreased by 0.2 percentage points to 29.1%. the effective tax rate for 2014 was unfavorably impacted by the above asset impairment and exit costs related to the factory closures. the 2013 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the additional expense associated with the enactment of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 ($17 million) and the enactment of tax law changes in mexico ($14 million), which decreased our diluted eps by $0.02 per share in 2013. excluding the impact of these items, the change in tax rate that increased our diluted eps by $0.02 per share in 2014 was primarily due to earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction and repatriation cost differences.
•   currency - the unfavorable currency impact during 2014 was due primarily to the argentine peso, australian dollar, canadian dollar, euro, indonesian rupiah, japanese yen, kazakhstan tenge, russian ruble, turkish lira and the ukraine hryvnia.
•   interest - the unfavorable impact of interest was due primarily to higher average debt levels, partially offset by lower average interest rates on debt.
•   lower shares outstanding and share-based payments - the favorable diluted eps impact was due to the repurchase of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program.
•   operations - the increase in diluted eps of $0.26 from our operations in the table above was due to the following segments:
•   eema: higher pricing and higher equity income in unconsolidated subsidiaries derived from our investments in north africa and russia, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, unfavorable volume/mix and higher marketing, administration and research costs; and
•   latin america &amp; canada: higher pricing, partially offset by higher marketing, administration and research costs, unfavorable volume/mix and higher manufacturing costs; partially offset by:
•   european union: higher marketing, administration and research costs, higher manufacturing costs and unfavorable volume/mix, partially offset by higher pricing; and
•   asia: unfavorable volume/mix and higher manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher pricing.
for further details, see the consolidated operating results and operating results by business segment sections of the following discussion and analysis.
• 2015 forecasted results - on february 5, 2015, we announced our forecast for 2015 full-year reported diluted eps to be in a range of $4.27 to $4.37, at prevailing exchange rates at that time, versus $4.76 in 2014. excluding an unfavorable currency impact, at then-prevailing rates, of approximately $1.15 per share for the full-year 2015, the reported diluted earnings per share range represents an increase of 8% to 10% versus adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.02 in 2014. this forecast includes incremental spending versus 2014 for our reduced-risk product, iqos. the spending, which is skewed towards the second half of the year, will support our plans for national expansion in japan and italy, as well as pilot or national launches in additional markets, later in 2015. this forecast does not include any share repurchases in 2015. the company will revisit the potential for repurchases as the year unfolds, depending on the currency environment.
we calculated 2014 adjusted diluted eps as reported diluted eps of $4.76, plus the $0.26 per share charge related to asset impairment and exit costs.
adjusted diluted eps is not a measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("u.s. gaap"). we define adjusted diluted eps as reported diluted eps adjusted for asset impairment and exit costs, discrete tax items and unusual items. we believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure as it represents core earnings, improves comparability and helps investors analyze business performance and trends. adjusted diluted eps should be considered neither in isolation nor as a substitute for reported diluted eps prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap.
this 2015 guidance excludes the impact of future acquisitions, unanticipated asset impairment and exit cost charges, future changes in currency exchange rates and any unusual events. the factors described in item 1a. risk factors represent continuing risks to this forecast.

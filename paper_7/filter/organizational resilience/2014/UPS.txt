item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview u.s. economic growth, retail sales and industrial production continued at a moderate pace in 2014, which resulted in growth in the small package delivery market. continued strong growth in e-commerce and omni-channel retail sales has driven package volume increases in both commercial and residential products. given these trends, overall volume growth was strong during the year, and products most aligned with business-to-consumer and retail industry shipments experienced the fastest growth.
economic conditions in europe have deteriorated somewhat, as solid growth in the united kingdom is being offset by slower growth in germany and general economic weakness in france and italy. economic growth in asia has continued, though growth in china has moderated. the uneven nature of economic growth worldwide, combined with a trend towards more intra-regional trade, has led to shifting trade patterns and resulted in overcapacity in certain trade lanes. these factors have created an environment in which customers are more likely to trade-down from premium express products to standard delivery products in both europe and asia. as a result of these circumstances, we have adjusted our air capacity and cost structure in our transportation network to better match the prevailing volume mix levels. our broad portfolio of product offerings and the flexibilities inherent in our transportation network have helped us adapt to these changing trends.
while the worldwide economic environment has remained challenging in 2014, we have continued to undertake several initiatives in the u.s. and internationally to (1) improve the flexibility and capacity in our delivery network; (2) improve yield management; and (3) increase operational efficiency and contain costs across all segments. most notably, the continued deployment of technology improvements (including several facility automation projects and the accelerated deployment of our on road integrated optimization and navigation system - "orion") should increase our network capacity, and improve operational efficiency, flexibility and reliability. additionally, we have continued to adjust our transportation network and utilize new or expanded operating facilities to improve time-in-transit for shipments in each region.

defined benefit plans mark-to-market charge in 2014 and 2012, we incurred pre-tax mark-to-market losses of $1.062 and $4.831 billion, respectively, on a consolidated basis ($670 million and $3.023 billion after-tax, respectively) on our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans related to the remeasurement of plan assets and liabilities recognized outside of a 10% corridor. no mark-to-market gain or loss was incurred in 2013, as the remeasurement of plan assets and liabilities only resulted in adjustments within the 10% corridor (and thus only impacted accumulated other comprehensive income). these mark-to-market losses in 2014 and 2012, which were recorded in compensation and benefits expense in our statements of consolidated income, impacted each of our three reporting segments in both years. the table below indicates the amounts associated with each component of the pre-tax mark-to-market loss, as well as the weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine our net periodic benefit costs, for each year:

the $1.062 and $4.831 billion pre-tax mark-to-market losses for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2012, respectively, were comprised of the following components:
2014 - $1.062 billion pre-tax mark-to-market loss:
•   discount rates ($954 million pre-tax loss): the weighted-average discount rate for our u.s. pension and postretirement medical plans and our international pension plans declined from 5.24% at december 31, 2013 to 4.36% at december 31, 2014. this overall decline in discount rates was driven by a 122 basis point decline in the 30 year treasury bond rate, but was partially offset by an increase in credit spreads on aa-rated 30 year bonds.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
•   return on assets ($42 million pre-tax gain): our expected rate of return on u.s. pension and postretirement medical plan assets is developed taking into consideration: (1) historical plan asset returns over long-term periods, (2) current market conditions, and (3) the mix of asset classes in our investment portfolio. we review the expected rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate. in 2014, the actual rate of return on plan assets of 9.45% exceeded our expected rate of return of 8.66%, primarily due to continued gains in the world equity markets.
•   demographic assumptions ($150 million pre-tax loss): the implementation of new u.s. mortality tables in 2014 resulted in an increased participant life expectancy assumption, which increased the overall projected benefit obligation for our plans.
2012 - $4.831 billion pre-tax mark-to-market loss:
•   discount rates ($5.530 billion pre-tax loss): the weighted-average discount rate for our u.s. pension and postretirement medical plans and our international pension plans declined from 5.58% at december 31, 2011 to 4.38% at december 31, 2012, due to two primary factors: (1) the discount rate for our u.s. pension and postretirement medical plans is determined using a bond matching approach for a portfolio of corporate aa bonds. in 2012, financial institutions comprised a smaller portion of our corporate aa bond portfolio relative to 2011, largely due to credit downgrades of several large financial institutions in 2012. (2) credit spreads on aa-rated 30-year bonds declined in 2012. these changes in the composition of our bond portfolio mix and the compression in credit spreads were the primary factors resulting in the 120 basis point decline in the weighted-average discount rate in 2012 relative to 2011.
•   return on assets ($708 million pre-tax gain): in 2012, the actual rate of return on plan assets of 11.76% exceeded our expected rate of return of 8.71%, primarily due to strong gains in the world equity markets.
•   demographic assumptions ($9 million pre-tax loss): this represents the difference between actual and estimated demographic factors, including items such as health care cost trends, mortality rates and compensation rate increases.
health and welfare plan charges in connection with the ratification of our national master agreement with the international brotherhood of teamsters ("teamsters") in 2014, we incurred pre-tax charges totaling $1.102 billion ($687 million after-tax) associated with changes in the delivery of healthcare benefits to certain active and retired union employees. these charges are discussed in further detail in the "collective bargaining agreements" section. these charges impacted our u.s. domestic package segment ($990 million), international package segment ($28 million) and supply chain & freight segment ($84 million).
tnt termination fee and related expenses on january 30, 2013, the european commission issued a formal decision prohibiting our proposed acquisition of tnt express n.v. ("tnt express"). as a result of the prohibition by the european commission, the condition of our offer requiring european union competition clearance was not fulfilled, and our proposed acquisition of tnt express could not be completed. given this outcome, ups and tnt express entered a separate agreement to terminate the merger protocol, and we withdrew our formal offer for tnt express. we paid a termination fee to tnt express of €200 million ($268 million) under this agreement, and also incurred transaction-related expenses of $16 million during the first quarter of 2013. the combination of these items resulted in a pre-tax charge of $284 million ($177 million after-tax), which impacted our international package segment.
gain upon the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary subsequent to the termination of the merger protocol, we liquidated a foreign subsidiary that would have been used to acquire the outstanding shares of tnt express in connection with the proposed acquisition. upon the liquidation of this subsidiary in the first quarter of 2013, we realized a pre-tax foreign currency gain of $245 million ($213 million after-tax), which impacted our international package segment.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations multiemployer pension plan withdrawal charge in 2012, we recognized an $896 million pre-tax charge ($559 million after-tax) for the establishment of a withdrawal liability related to our withdrawal from the new england teamsters and trucking industry pension fund ("new england pension fund"), a multiemployer pension plan. this charge is discussed in further detail in the "collective bargaining agreements" section. this charge was recorded in compensation and benefits expense in our statements of consolidated income, and impacted our u.s. domestic package segment.
results of operations-segment review the results and discussions that follow are reflective of how our executive management monitors the performance of our reporting segments. we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") with certain non-gaap financial measures, including operating profit, operating margin, pre-tax income, net income and earnings per share adjusted for the non-comparable items discussed previously. we believe that these adjusted measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and analysts in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. we believe these adjusted financial measures are important indicators of our recurring results of operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, our core operating results, and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. additionally, these adjusted financial measures are used internally by management for the determination of incentive compensation awards, business unit operating performance analysis, and business unit resource allocation.
as discussed in our "critical accounting policies and estimates", we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10% corridor immediately as part of net periodic benefit cost. in our results of operations and the discussions that follow, we have presented adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin excluding the portion of net periodic benefit cost represented by the gains and losses recognized in excess of the 10% corridor. this adjusted net periodic benefit cost is comparable to the accounting for our defined benefit plans in our quarterly reporting under u.s. gaap, and reflects assumptions utilizing the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used for determining net periodic benefit cost (the non-adjusted net periodic benefit cost reflects the actual return on plan assets and the discount rate used for measuring the projected benefit obligation). we believe this adjusted net periodic benefit cost provides important supplemental information that reflects the anticipated long-term cost of our defined benefit plans, and provides a benchmark for historical defined benefit cost trends that can be used to better compare year-to-year financial performance without considering the short-term impact of changes in market interest rates, equity prices, and similar factors.
certain operating expenses are allocated between our reporting segments based on activity-based costing methods. these activity-based costing methods require us to make estimates that impact the amount of each expense category that is attributed to each segment. changes in these estimates will directly impact the amount of expense allocated to each segment, and therefore the operating profit of each reporting segment. there were no significant changes in our expense allocation methodology during 2014, 2013 or 2012.

united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations revenue the change in overall revenue was impacted by the following factors for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, compared with the corresponding prior year periods:
volume          rates /product mix   fuelsurcharge            totalrevenuechange revenue change drivers:
our total volume increased in 2014, largely due to continued solid growth in e-commerce and overall retail sales.  business-to-consumer shipments, which represent more than 45% of total u.s. domestic package volume, grew 12% for the year and drove increases in both air and ground shipments. ups surepost volume increased more than 45% in 2014, and accounted for approximately half of the overall volume growth for the segment. business-to-business volume grew 3% in 2014, largely due to increased volume from the retail industry, including the use of our solutions for omni-channel (including ship-from-store and ship-to-store models) and returns shipping; additionally, business-to-business volume was positively impacted by growth in shipments from the industrial, automotive and government sectors.
among our air products, volume increased in 2014 for both our next day air and deferred services. solid air volume growth continued for those products most aligned with business-to-consumer shipping, particularly our residential second day air package product. our business-to-business air volume increased slightly as well, largely due to growth in the retail and industrial sectors. this growth was slightly offset by a decline in air letter volume, which was negatively impacted by some competitive losses and slowing growth in the financial services industry. the growth in premium and deferred air volume continues to be impacted by economic conditions and changes in our customers' supply chain networks; the combination of these factors influences their sensitivity towards the price and speed of shipments, and therefore favoring the use of our deferred air services.
the increase in ground volume in 2014 was driven by our surepost service offering, which had a volume increase of more than 45% for the year; additionally, we experienced moderate volume growth in our traditional residential and commercial ground services. demand for surepost and our traditional residential products continues to be driven by business-to-consumer shipping activity from e-commerce retailers and other large customers. the growth in business-to-business ground volume was largely due to growth in omni-channel retail volume, the increased use of our returns service offerings, and the growth in shipments from the industrial sector.
our overall volume increased in 2013 compared with 2012, largely due to continued solid growth in e-commerce and overall retail sales; however, the increase in volume was hindered by slow overall u.s. economic and industrial production growth. business-to-consumer shipments, which represent over 40% of total u.s. domestic package volume, grew approximately 8% for the year and drove increases in both air and ground shipments. growth accelerated during our peak holiday shipping season, as business-to-consumer volume grew over 11% in the fourth quarter of 2013, and business-to-consumer shipments exceeded 50% of total u.s. domestic package volume for the first time. business-to-business volume increased slightly in 2013, largely due to increased shipping activity by the retail industry; however, business-to-business volume was negatively impacted by slowing industrial production.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations among our air products, volume increased in 2013 compared with 2012, as growth in our deferred products more than offset a small decline in our next day air services. solid air volume growth continued for those products most aligned with business-to-consumer shipping, including our residential second day air package and residential next day air saver products. next day air letter volume decreased approximately 7% for the year, and was negatively impacted by competitive losses and slowing growth in the financial services industry. our business-to-business air volume continued to be impacted by sluggish economic conditions in the u.s., low levels of inventory replenishment among our customers and changes in our customers' supply chain networks. the combination of these factors influenced our customers' sensitivity towards the price and speed of shipments, and therefore the use of our premium air services.
the increase in ground volume in 2013 was primarily attributed to our traditional residential service offerings and surepost. demand for these residential products continues to be driven by business-to-consumer shipping activity from e-commerce retailers and other large customers. business-to-business ground volume also showed a small increase, and was positively impacted by the overall expansion of the u.s. retail sector; however, continued weakness in industrial production hindered growth. the increased use of omni-channel retailing (including ship-from-store and ship-to-store models) by customers is also positively impacting volume growth for both our residential and commercial ground products.
overall revenue per piece decreased 1.5% in 2014, and was impacted by changes in base rates, customer and product mix, and fuel surcharge rates.
revenue per piece for our ground and air products was positively impacted by an increase in base rates that took effect on december 30, 2013. we implemented an average 4.9% net increase in base and accessorial rates on ups next day air, ups 2nd day air and ups 3 day select and ups ground.
revenue per piece increased for our next day air products in 2014, largely due to the base rate increase, an increase in the average weight per package, and a shift in product mix from lower-yielding letters towards higher-yielding packages. revenue per piece declined for our deferred products in 2014, as customer and product mix changes more than offset the increase in base rates. product mix adversely impacted deferred revenue per piece, as we experienced relatively stronger growth in our lighter-weight business-to-consumer shipments, which have lower average yields than our heavier-weight commercial shipments. customer mix also adversely impacted deferred revenue per piece, due to the faster volume growth among our larger customers, which typically have a lower average yield than our smaller and middle-market customers.
ground revenue per piece decreased in 2014, as customer and product mix changes more than offset the impact of the base rate increase. customer and product mix changes adversely impacted revenue per piece as a greater portion of our overall volume in 2014, relative to 2013, came from lighter-weight shipments (including more than 45% volume growth in surepost) and larger customers.
overall revenue per piece was relatively flat in 2013 compared with 2012, and was impacted by changes in base rates, customer and product mix, and fuel surcharge rates.
revenue per piece for our ground and air products was positively impacted by an increase in base rates that took effect on december 31, 2012. we increased the base rates 6.5% on ups next day air, ups 2nd day air and ups 3 day select, and 5.9% on ups ground, while reducing our fuel surcharge indices. other pricing changes included an increase in the residential surcharge, and an increase in the delivery area surcharge on certain residential and commercial services. these rate changes are customary and occur on an annual basis.
revenue per piece increased for next day air in 2013, and was positively impacted by the base rate increase and the loss of some lower-yielding letter volume. revenue per piece for our deferred products declined, as the impact of the base rate increase was more than offset by declines in fuel surcharge rates and changes in customer and product mix. revenue per piece for our air products was adversely impacted by the relatively stronger growth in our lower-yielding next day air saver and deferred products, compared with our premium next day air services, as well as the faster growth in lighter-weight business-to-consumer shipments. additionally, revenue per piece was negatively affected by the faster volume growth among our larger customers, which typically have a lower average yield than our smaller and middle-market customers.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ground revenue per piece increased in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily due to the base rate increase; however, this was partially offset by customer and product mix changes, as a greater portion of our overall volume in 2013, relative to 2012, came from lighter-weight shipments and larger customers. fuel surcharge rate changes adversely impacted ground revenue per piece growth in 2013 compared with 2012.
fuel surcharges ups applies a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services. the air fuel surcharge is based on the u.s. department of energy's ("doe") gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel, while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the doe's on-highway diesel fuel price. in connection with our base rate increase on december 31, 2012, we modified the fuel surcharge on air and ground services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2% and 1%, respectively. based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge rates for domestic air and ground products were as follows:
year ended december 31,                       % point change total fuel surcharge revenue declined by $8 million in 2014, as lower fuel surcharge rates (driven by lower fuel prices) slightly more than offset the impact of increased air and ground volume. in 2013, total fuel surcharge revenue declined by $178 million due to lower fuel surcharge rates (driven primarily by the reductions in the index on both the air and ground surcharges, as well as lower fuel prices).
operating expenses adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased $1.871 billion in 2014, primarily due to pick-up and delivery costs (up $821 million), the cost of operating our domestic integrated air and ground network (up $719 million) and the costs of package sorting (up $167 million). these costs were impacted by several factors:
•   we incurred higher employee compensation costs, largely resulting from an increase in average daily union labor hours (up 7.5%), union contractual wage rate increases, increased employee healthcare expenses and growth in the overall size of the workforce. the increase in labor hours was driven by volume growth, additional overtime and training hours during our fourth quarter holiday shipping season, and adverse weather conditions in early 2014.
•   we incurred higher expenses associated with outside contract carriers, due to volume growth, issues associated with the service performance of rail carriers, and the adverse weather conditions in early 2014.
•   these cost increases were partially offset by a reduction in worker's compensation expense, due to actuarial adjustments that were largely attributable to operational safety and claims management initiatives.
•   these cost increases were also mitigated by certain network efficiency and productivity improvements, which resulted in a 0.4% reduction in the total adjusted cost per piece in 2014 compared with 2013. we have continued to adjust our air and ground networks to better match higher volume levels, utilize technology to increase package sorting and delivery efficiency, and benefit from improved pick-up and delivery densities (particularly for our residential products). these improvements allowed us to process increased volume (up 6.4%) at a faster rate than the increase in average daily aircraft block hours (up 2.4%) and vehicle miles driven (up 4.2%).
in the fourth quarter of 2014, adjusted operating expenses increased 9.4%, as decreased productivity, higher contract carrier rates, and additional union overtime and training hours contributed to approximately $200 million in excess costs. in order to process the significant increase in package volume while maintaining service levels, we increased our overall capacity through additional staffing, more equipment rentals and new operating facilities. additionally, we elected to operate on one additional day during the fourth quarter of 2014 to further improve service levels. however, the significant variability in package volume during the holiday shipping season resulted in a sub-optimized transportation network, and a reduction in productivity (average daily union labor hours increased 10.5%, compared with the volume increase of 6.6%). the total adjusted cost per piece in the fourth quarter of 2014 increased 1.0% compared with the fourth quarter of 2013.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased $1.147 billion in 2013 compared with 2012. this increase was primarily due to pick-up and delivery costs, which grew $772 million, as well as the cost of operating our domestic integrated air and ground network, which increased $290 million for the year. the growth in pick-up and delivery and network costs was largely due to increased volume and higher employee compensation costs, which were impacted by a union contractual wage increase (package driver wage rates rose 2.2%), an increase in average daily driver hours (up 2.2%) and an increase in employee pension and healthcare costs. partially offsetting these cost increases was a reduction in worker's compensation expense, due to actuarial adjustments that were largely attributable to operational safety and claims management initiatives.
cost increases have been mitigated as we adjust our air and ground networks to better match higher volume levels and utilize technology to increase package sorting and delivery efficiency. improved pick-up and delivery densities, particularly for our residential products, have also contained increases in cost. these network efficiency improvements allowed us to process increased volume (up 3.7%) at a faster rate than the increase in average daily union labor hours (up 3.1%), aircraft block hours (down 0.6%) and miles driven (up 1.8%) in 2013 compared with 2012. as a result, the total adjusted cost per piece increased only 0.4% in 2013.
several factors caused our fourth quarter operating expenses to significantly increase (adjusted operating expenses increased $553 million, or 7.3%, in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared with the same period of 2012). higher-than-planned volume growth, combined with adverse weather conditions and the relatively compressed holiday shipping season in 2013 (there were six fewer days between the thanksgiving and christmas holidays in 2013 relative to 2012), resulted in a significant increase in labor hours and the greater use of contract carriers to help meet our service commitments. additionally, the much later-than-anticipated seasonal increase in volume during the fourth quarter strained our transportation network, resulting in lower productivity (total union labor hours increased 6.2%, while volume increased 5.6% in the fourth quarter).
operating profit and margin adjusted operating profit decreased $94 million in 2014 compared with 2013, and was impacted by several factors. we incurred approximately $200 million of additional operating costs during the fourth quarter holiday shipping season, largely due to decreased productivity, higher contract carrier rates, and additional union overtime and training hours. the unfavorable weather conditions in the u.s. in early 2014 reduced operating profit approximately $200 million in 2014, including the estimated loss in package volume, increased guaranteed service refunds to customers and higher operating expenses. additionally, changes in customer and product mix combined to pressure our revenue per piece. these factors were partially offset by solid volume growth and the overall productivity improvements (resulting in lower cost per piece) discussed previously. the combination of these factors led to a 90 basis point decline in our operating margin in 2014 compared with 2013.
adjusted operating profit increased $71 million in 2013 compared with 2012, as the volume growth and productivity improvements discussed previously more than offset the pressure on revenue per piece and the adverse impact of fuel. overall volume growth allowed us to better leverage our transportation network, resulting in greater productivity and better pick-up and delivery density; however, these factors were partially offset by changes in customer and product mix, which combined to pressure our revenue per piece. additionally, the net impact of fuel adversely affected operating profit by $158 million in 2013 compared with 2012, as fuel surcharge revenue decreased at a faster rate than fuel expense.
although annual adjusted operating profit improved in 2013, it declined by $178 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared with the fourth quarter of 2012. this decline in profitability was largely due to additional labor and purchased transportation costs, as heavier-than-anticipated volume, adverse weather conditions and a compressed holiday shipping season combined to result in approximately $125 to $150 million in extra costs in the fourth quarter of 2013. in addition, we incurred approximately $50 million in service refunds for unmet delivery commitments in the fourth quarter of 2013. the combination of these factors resulted in a 250 basis point decrease in our fourth quarter operating margin.

united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations volume our overall average daily volume increased in 2014, largely due to strong demand from several economic sectors (including retail, healthcare, industrial and automotive).
we continued to experience strong export volume growth in 2014, with increases from all regions in the world. european export volume increased 12% for the year, with particular strength in the intra-european trade lanes and the europe-to-u.s. trade lane. asian export volume increased at a moderate pace (with strength in the asia-to-u.s. and asia-to-europe trade lanes), and benefited from technology sector product launches. export volume continued to shift towards our standard products, such as transborder standard and worldwide expedited, as compared with our premium express products, such as worldwide express. our international customers continue to be impacted by economic pressures and changes in their supply chain networks, and the combination of these factors influences their sensitivity towards the price and speed of shipments.
the strong increase in domestic volume in 2014 was driven by solid volume growth in canada, italy, spain, france and the united kingdom.
our overall average daily volume increased in 2013 compared with 2012, largely due to growth in key markets in europe, as well as canada and mexico.
export volume increased in 2013, and was driven by europe (largely in the intra-european trade lanes) and the americas (particularly in the canada-to-u.s. and mexico-to-u.s. trade lanes). asian export volume grew at a moderate pace due to continued regional economic growth and expansion of our service offerings, but was negatively impacted by fewer technology product launches from our customers and a small number of competitive losses. volume continued to shift towards our standard products, such as transborder standard and worldwide expedited, as compared with our premium express products, such as worldwide express.
domestic volume increased in 2013 compared to 2012, and was driven by solid volume growth in several key markets, including italy, canada, poland and turkey.
total average revenue per piece decreased 1.5% in 2014 on a currency-adjusted basis, and was impacted by changes in base rates as well as product mix.
on december 30, 2013, we implemented an average 4.9% net increase in base and accessorial rates for international shipments originating in the united states (worldwide express, worldwide saver, ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service). rate changes for shipments originating outside the u.s. are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market.
currency-adjusted export revenue per piece decreased 3.1% in 2014, as the shift in product mix from our premium express products to our standard products more than offset the increase in base rates (volume for our standard products increased 12%, while volume for our premium express products increased 4%). additionally, currency-adjusted export revenue per piece was adversely impacted by shorter average trade lanes (due to faster growth in intra-regional shipments) and changes in customer mix (as export volume growth for larger customers exceeded the volume growth for higher-yielding middle market customers).
currency-adjusted domestic revenue per piece increased 0.3% in 2014, and was impacted by base rate increases, as well as changes in product mix and fuel surcharge rates.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations total average revenue per piece decreased 2.5% in 2013 on a currency-adjusted basis, and was impacted by changes in base rates, customer and product mix, and fuel surcharge rates.
on december 31, 2012, we increased the base rates 6.5% for international shipments originating in the united states (worldwide express, worldwide express plus, ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service), while reducing fuel surcharge indices. rate changes for shipments originating outside the u.s. are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market.
currency-adjusted export revenue per piece decreased 3.7% in 2013, as the shift in product mix from our premium express products to our standard products more than offset the increase in base rates. currency-adjusted export revenue per piece was also negatively affected by the faster growth among our larger customers, which tend to have a lower yield than middle market and smaller accounts. additionally, currency-adjusted export revenue per piece was adversely impacted by shorter average trade lanes (due to faster growth in intra-regional shipments), as well as a small impact on pricing from overcapacity in the asia outbound freight market.
currency-adjusted domestic revenue per piece decreased 0.4% in 2013. domestic revenue per piece was adversely impacted by the faster domestic volume growth in our lower-yielding standard service, as well as product and customer mix changes in several developed markets.
fuel surcharges we maintain fuel surcharges on our international air and ground services. the fuel surcharges for international air products originating inside or outside the united states are indexed to the doe's gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel, while the fuel surcharges for ground products originating outside the united states are indexed to fuel prices in the international region or country where the shipment takes place.  in connection with our base rate increase on december 31, 2012, we modified the fuel surcharge on certain u.s.-related international air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2%.
total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by $2 million in 2014, as the combined impact of international air volume growth and modifications to the fuel surcharge indices were largely offset by declining fuel prices. total international fuel surcharge revenue decreased by $135 million in 2013, largely due to declining fuel prices and the 2% reduction in the index; however, this was partially offset by increases in international air volume.
operating expenses overall adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased $450 million in 2014. this increase was driven by the cost of pick-up and delivery, which increased $201 million, as well as the cost of operating our international integrated air and ground network, which increased $150 million. the increases in pick-up and delivery and network costs were largely driven by higher package volume and higher expense for outside transportation carriers (which was impacted by network capacity constraints in europe). however, network cost increases were mitigated by reductions in average daily aircraft block hours (1.1% decrease in 2014), as a result of ongoing modifications to our air network; this was achieved even with a 7.8% increase in international export volume and several air product service enhancements.
the remaining increase in adjusted operating expenses in 2014 was largely due to the costs of package sorting, which increased $52 million, and was impacted by volume growth. additionally, indirect operating costs increased $47 million in 2014, and were affected by various factors, including restructuring charges, foreign currency remeasurement losses, legal contingency accruals, bad debt expense, and several other factors.
excluding the impact of currency exchange rate changes, the total adjusted cost per piece for the segment decreased 1.6% in 2014.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overall adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased $319 million in 2013 compared with 2012. this increase was driven by the cost of pick-up and delivery, which increased $195 million for the year, largely due to higher package volume.
the cost of operating our international integrated air and ground network increased $111 million for the year, also largely due to higher package volume; however, network costs were mitigated by a 0.4% reduction in average daily aircraft block hours resulting from ongoing modifications to our air network. this was achieved even with a 6.4% increase in international export volume and several air product service enhancements that occurred during 2013.
the remaining increases in adjusted operating expenses for the year were largely due to the costs of package sorting, which was impacted by volume growth, and indirect operating costs, which were affected by increased expenses associated with aviation security.
excluding the impact of currency exchange rate changes, the total adjusted cost per piece for the segment decreased 2.7% in 2013 compared with 2012.
operating profit and margin adjusted operating profit increased by $109 million in 2014, while the adjusted operating margin increased 20 basis points. these increases were largely due to moderate revenue growth combined with the mitigation of expense increases through improved productivity.
in addition to the aforementioned factors, the net impact of fuel (fuel surcharge revenue grew faster than fuel expense) and the net impact of currency (remeasurement and translation gains) resulted in a favorable impact on operating profit of $127 million when comparing 2014 with 2013. fuel surcharge revenue was favorably impacted during 2014 by rate increases to the fuel surcharge index. operating profit in 2014 was negatively impacted by $21 million due to a restructuring charge and related costs in europe.
adjusted operating profit contracted by 0.8% in 2013 compared with 2012, while the adjusted operating margin decreased 40 basis points. the solid volume growth in 2013 was largely offset by reductions in revenue per piece, leading to only slight growth in revenue. the net impact of fuel (fuel surcharge revenue decreased at a faster rate than fuel expense) as well as currency remeasurement and translation losses combined to decrease operating profit by $219 million when comparing 2013 with 2012. the combination of low revenue growth and the adverse impact of fuel and currency led to the reduction in adjusted operating margin.

forwarding and logistics revenue increased $266 million in 2014 compared with 2013. forwarding revenue increased for the year, primarily due to volume and tonnage growth in our international air freight, north american air freight and ocean freight businesses, which were impacted by improving overall market demand. this was partially offset, however, by lower rates charged to our customers in our international air forwarding business, which was largely due to industry overcapacity in key trade lanes, particularly the asia-outbound market. revenue for our logistics products increased in 2014, as we experienced solid growth in our mail services, healthcare and retail distribution solutions.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations freight revenue increased $166 million in 2014, driven by solid increases in average daily ltl shipments and ltl revenue per hundredweight. the increase in average daily ltl shipments in 2014 was impacted by overall u.s. economic growth and improving ltl market conditions. the increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight was largely due to our focus on yield management, as well as general rate increases averaging 4.4% and 5.9% that took effect in march 2014 and june 2013, respectively, covering non-contractual shipments in the united states, canada and mexico. ltl fuel surcharge revenue increased by $13 million in 2014 compared with 2013, due to changes in diesel fuel prices and overall ltl shipment volume.
revenue for the other businesses within supply chain & freight increased $26 million in 2014, due to revenue growth at the ups store, ups capital and ups customer solutions; however, this was partially offset by a decline in revenue from our contract to provide domestic air transportation services for the u.s. postal service.
forwarding and logistics revenue decreased $485 million in 2013 compared with 2012. forwarding revenue decreased in 2013, primarily due to lower tonnage and rates charged to our customers in our international air forwarding business. the reduction in tonnage was caused by several factors, including weak overall market demand, competitive pressures, and our customer concentration among the technology and military sectors, as demand in these sectors was relatively weaker than the remainder of the air freight market. the reduction in rates was largely due to industry overcapacity in key trade lanes, particularly the asia-outbound market. revenue for our logistics products increased in 2013 compared with 2012, as we experienced solid growth in our mail services and healthcare distribution solutions; however, this was largely offset by revenue declines among our technology customers.
freight revenue increased $242 million in 2013, driven by an increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight, tonnage and average daily ltl shipments. the increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight was largely due to our focus on yield management, as well as general rate increases averaging 5.9% that took effect on both july 16, 2012 and on june 10, 2013, covering non-contractual shipments in the united states, canada and mexico. ltl fuel surcharge revenue increased by $18 million in 2013 compared with the prior year, due to changes in diesel fuel prices and overall ltl shipment volume. in addition, our truckload division experienced increased volume and revenue, primarily related to our dedicated and non-dedicated service offerings.
the other businesses within supply chain & freight increased revenue by $31 million in 2013, primarily due to growth at ups capital, the ups store and ups customer solutions.
operating expenses forwarding and logistics adjusted operating expenses increased $266 million in 2014, largely due to higher purchased transportation and employee compensation expenses. purchased transportation expense increased by $229 million for the year, primarily due to higher volume and tonnage in our international air freight forwarding business and higher rates charged to us by third-party transportation carriers. compensation and benefits expense increased $47 million in 2014, due to merit salary and wage increases for management and hourly employees, along with an increase in the overall size of the workforce.
freight adjusted operating expenses increased $140 million in 2014, while the total adjusted cost per ltl shipment increased 2.0%. the increase in adjusted operating expenses was largely due to pick-up and delivery expenses (which increased $96 million) and the costs associated with operating our linehaul network (which increased $65 million). the increases in pick-up and delivery and network costs were primarily due to contractual wage increases, higher ltl volume and increased costs associated with outside contract and rail carriers. partially offsetting these cost increases were reductions in indirect operating expenses, including lower auto liability and worker's compensation costs, which were impacted by operational safety and claims management initiatives, as well as lower pension expense.
operating expenses for the other businesses within supply chain & freight increased $8 million in 2014 compared with 2013.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forwarding and logistics adjusted operating expenses decreased $388 million in 2013 compared with 2012, due to several factors. purchased transportation expense declined by $236 million, primarily due to lower tonnage in our international air freight forwarding business. compensation and benefits expense declined by $59 million, largely due to reduced payroll costs and lower expense for worker's compensation claims. the remaining decrease in expense resulted from lower fuel costs, bad debt expense, and various other items.
freight adjusted operating expenses increased $234 million in 2013, while the total cost per ltl shipment increased 2.0%. the largest component of this increase related to the cost of operating our linehaul network, which grew by $62 million, as a result of a 3.7% average daily tonnage increase, coupled with wage and purchased transportation increases. our truckload division experienced a $48 million increase in costs for the year, largely related to the expansion of our dedicated and non-dedicated services. pick-up and delivery costs increased $15 million as a result of higher volume and wage increases, but were partially offset by productivity improvements. the remaining increase in expense in 2013 was impacted by increases in pension expense and healthcare costs.
adjusted operating expenses for the other businesses within supply chain & freight decreased $4 million in 2013 compared with 2012.
operating profit and margin adjusted operating profit for the forwarding and logistics unit remained comparable between 2014 and 2013, and was impacted by several factors. operating profit in the international air forwarding business declined in 2014, as continued excess market capacity in key trade lanes reduced the margin between the rates we charge our customers and the rates at which we procure capacity from third party air carriers. we increased profitability in our north american air freight, ocean freight, distribution and mail services units in 2014, as a result of improving market demand and cost controls.
adjusted operating profit for our freight unit increased $26 million in 2014 compared with 2013, as shipment growth, increased yields and higher productivity more than offset contractual union wage increases.
the combined operating profit for all of our other businesses in this segment increased $18 million in 2014, primarily due to higher operating profit at ups capital and ups customer solutions.
adjusted operating profit for the forwarding and logistics unit decreased by $97 million in 2013 compared with 2012. this decrease was primarily due to reduced profitability in our international air forwarding business, which resulted from competitive pressures combined with weak overall air freight market demand due to continued economic weakness in europe, slowing growth in china and a sluggish u.s. economy. additionally, our customer concentration among the technology and military sectors negatively impacted our results, as demand in these sectors was relatively weaker than the remainder of the air freight market. this lower demand pressured the rates we charge to our customers, which more than offset the reduced rates we incur from third-party transportation carriers, and thereby led to a compression in our operating margin.
adjusted operating profit for our freight unit increased $8 million in 2013 compared with 2012, as improvements in average daily ltl volume, yields and productivity measures (including gains in pick-up and delivery stops per hour, dock bills per hour and linehaul network utilization) more than offset an increase in wage and benefit expenses.
the combined adjusted operating profit for all of our other businesses in this segment increased $35 million in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily due to higher operating profit at ups capital and the ups store.

compensation and benefits employee payroll costs increased $1.054 billion in 2014, compared with 2013, largely due to contractual union wage rate increases, a 7.5% increase in average daily union labor hours, and a merit salary increase for management employees. the increase in average daily union labor hours was impacted by volume growth, as well as additional training hours for the seasonal fourth quarter staffing increase. additionally, adverse weather conditions in the early part of 2014 contributed to an increase in labor hours in the year-to-date comparison.
adjusted benefits expense increased $270 million in 2014, primarily due to increased health and welfare costs, payroll taxes, and vacation, holiday and excused absence expenses. however, these factors were partially offset by a reduction in pension costs and workers compensation expense. these factors are discussed further as follows:
•   adjusted health and welfare costs increased $221 million in 2014, largely due to higher medical claims in company-sponsored plans, increased contributions to multiemployer plans and the impact of several provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010. the growth in multiemployer plan contributions was impacted by contractual contribution rate increases and higher union labor hours.
•   payroll taxes increased $73 million in 2014, primarily as a result of higher union labor hours, union wage rate increases and higher management incentive compensation payments.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
•   vacation, holiday and excused absence expense increased $41 million in 2014, due to an increase in the overall number of employees and increased vacation entitlements earned based on employees' years of service.
•   adjusted pension costs declined $23 million in 2014, as a decrease in the expense for company-sponsored pension plans (largely due to higher discount rates used to determine pension cost for 2014) was largely offset by higher contributions to multiemployer pension plans (due to both increased contribution rates and higher union labor hours).
•   workers compensation expense decreased $69 million in 2014, impacting all segments. insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported worker's compensation claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not reported, and take into account a number of factors including our history of claim losses, payroll growth and the impact of safety improvement initiatives. in 2014, we experienced favorable actuarial expense adjustments as the frequency and severity of claims was less than previously projected, due to the impact of ongoing operational safety improvement and claim management initiatives.
employee payroll costs increased $684 million in 2013 compared with 2012, largely due to contractual union wage rate increases, a 3.1% increase in average daily union labor hours, and a merit salary increase for management employees; however, this was partially offset by an overall reduction in the number of management personnel.
adjusted benefits expense increased $498 million in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily due to higher pension expense, increased vacation, holiday and excused absence expense, and higher health and welfare costs; however, these items were partially offset by changes in the expense associated with our self-insurance for worker's compensation claims. these primary factors impacting expense are discussed further as follows:
•   pension expense increased $300 million in 2013 compared with 2012, due to higher union contribution rates for multiemployer pension plans combined with increased service and interest costs for company-sponsored plans. the increase in service and interest costs for company-sponsored plans was largely due to continued service accruals and lower discount rates.
•   vacation, holiday and excused absence expense increased $89 million in 2013 compared with 2012, due to increased vacation entitlements earned based on employees' years of service, higher wage rates and an increase in the overall number of employees during 2013.
•   health and welfare costs increased $182 million in 2013 compared with 2012, largely due to increased contribution rates to multiemployer plans, higher medical claims in ups-sponsored plans, and the impact of several provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010.
•   the expense associated with our self-insurance programs for worker's compensation claims decreased $131 million in 2013 compared with 2012. in 2013, we experienced favorable actuarial expense adjustments as the frequency and severity of claims was less than previously projected, due to the impact of ongoing safety improvement and claim management initiatives.
repairs and maintenance the increase in repairs and maintenance expense in 2014 was primarily due to a $93 million increase in airframe and aircraft engine repair and component replacement costs, largely in our boeing 747 and 767 aircraft fleets. the remaining increase was largely due to increased vehicle maintenance costs in our global package and freight operations, primarily due to the growth in the size of our vehicle fleet.
the increase in repairs and maintenance expense was largely due to increased vehicle maintenance costs in our global package and freight operations. these higher costs were impacted by the increase in miles driven in 2013 compared with 2012, as well as the overall increase in the size of our vehicle fleet in our u.s. domestic package and ups freight operations.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations depreciation and amortization the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2014, compared with 2013, was primarily due to a $45 million increase in the depreciation expense on vehicles, due to the replacement of older, fully-depreciated vehicles, technology upgrades on vehicles and an overall increase in the size of our vehicle fleet in our u.s. domestic package and ups freight operations. additionally, amortization expense increased $20 million, primarily related to intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions. these factors were partially offset by a decrease in building and facility depreciation, as several operating facilities became fully-depreciated.
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2013, compared with 2012, was primarily due to a $62 million increase in depreciation expense on vehicles. this increase was driven by the replacement of older, fully-depreciated vehicles, technology upgrades on new vehicles and an overall increase in the size of our vehicle fleet. this increase was largely offset by several factors, including lower building and facility depreciation and capitalized software amortization.
the $974 million increase in purchased transportation expense charged to us by third-party air, ocean and truck carriers in 2014 was driven by several factors:
•   our u.s. domestic package segment incurred a $474 million increase in expense in 2014, primarily due to (1) higher fees paid to the u.s. postal service associated with the volume growth in our surepost product; (2) the increased use of, and higher rates passed to us from, rail carriers; and (3) the increased use of outside contract carriers, which was impacted by volume growth and rail carrier service issues; additionally, adverse weather conditions in the early months of 2014 resulted in the additional use of outside contract carriers. approximately $177 million of the increase, or 37% of the total increase for the year, was attributable to the fourth quarter as a result of high seasonal volume.
•   our international package segment incurred a $203 million increase in expense in 2014, primarily due to higher costs incurred for the use of outside transportation providers, which was impacted by strong international volume growth.
•   our ups freight business incurred a $68 million increase in expense in 2014, largely due to increased ltl and brokerage volume, and the resulting increased use of, and higher rates passed to us from, outside transportation carriers.
•   the purchased transportation expense for our forwarding and logistics business increased $229 million in 2014, largely due to increased volume and tonnage in our international air freight, north american air freight, and ocean forwarding businesses.
the increase in purchased transportation expense charged to us by third-party air, ocean and truck carriers in 2013, compared with 2012, was driven by several factors:
•   our u.s. domestic package segment incurred a $154 million expense increase for the year, primarily due to higher rates passed to us from rail carriers, and higher fees paid to the u.s. postal service associated with the volume growth in our surepost product. this increase in expense was also impacted by the adverse weather conditions in the fourth quarter of 2013, as well as the significant increase in volume during the compressed timing of the holiday season.
•   our international package segment incurred a $144 million expense increase for the year, primarily due to international volume growth.
•   our ups freight business incurred a $70 million increase for the year, largely due to growth in ltl volume and higher rates passed to us from rail carriers.
•   the purchased transportation expense for our forwarding &amp; logistics business declined $236 million for the year, largely due to lower tonnage and reduced rates from third-party transportation carriers in our international air freight forwarding business.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fuel the $144 million decrease in fuel expense in 2014 was primarily due to lower fuel prices (net of hedging activity), which decreased fuel expense by $180 million in 2014. this was partially offset by higher fuel usage (due to an increase in aircraft block hours and vehicle miles driven), which increased expense by $36 million.
the decrease in fuel expense in 2013 was largely due to the decline in fuel prices (primarily jet-a fuel prices), which decreased expense by $77 million, net of hedging. this was partially offset by a $14 million increase in overall fuel usage, which was primarily due to lower vehicle fuel efficiency and an increase in miles driven.
the increase in other occupancy expense in 2014 was largely due to an increase in facility rent expense ($25 million), property taxes ($10 million) and natural gas and electric utility costs ($32 million). the increase in rent, property taxes and utilities expense was impacted by new leases on facilities to support the growth of our u.s. domestic package operations. additionally, adverse weather conditions in the u.s. in the early months of 2014 resulted in $15 million of increased snow removal costs at our operating facilities.
the increase in other occupancy expense in 2013, compared with 2012, was primarily due to higher snow removal costs at our operating facilities, an increase in utility expenses, as well as higher real estate taxes. the relatively cold winter in the united states in 2013 compared with 2012 caused the increase in snow removal costs, while increased usage and higher prices of natural gas and electricity resulted in the increase in utility expenses.
the $300 million increase in adjusted other expenses in 2014 was impacted by a number of factors. transportation equipment rental expense increased $90 million for the year, and was affected by the growth in package volume (particularly the seasonal volume increase in the fourth quarter). we also incurred increases in several other expense categories, including transportation security costs, employee expense reimbursements and recruitment costs (related to training and staffing for the seasonal volume increase in the fourth quarter) and legal contingency expenses. these increases were partially offset by business interruption insurance claim reimbursements from previous weather-related events, as well as lower advertising costs.
the decrease in adjusted other expenses in 2013 compared with 2012 was impacted by a number of factors, including decreases in bad debt expense, employee expense reimbursements, advertising costs, telecommunications expenses, and non-income based state and local taxes. these decreases in expense were partially offset by increases in auto liability insurance, transportation equipment rentals, and air cargo handling costs.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations investment income and interest expense the following table sets forth investment income and interest expense for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 (in millions):
year ended december 31,                                                              % change the increase in investment income in 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily due to a $7 million decrease in losses from fair value adjustments on real estate partnerships. this was partially offset by a decline in interest income, largely due to having a lower average balance of invested assets in 2014.
the decrease in investment income in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on invested assets, as well as a decline in the average balance of invested assets. these factors were partially offset by higher realized gains on the sales of securities in 2013 compared with 2012.
interest expense decreased in 2014 compared with 2013, largely due to having a lower average balance of debt outstanding. in addition, interest expense declined due to a decrease in the interest rate indices underlying our variable-rate debt and swaps in 2014 compared with 2013.
interest expense decreased in 2013 compared to 2012, largely due to three factors: (1) having a greater proportion of our debt swapped to lower-yielding variable rates, (2) a decrease in the interest rate indices underlying our variable-rate debt and swaps, and (3) a lower average balance of debt outstanding. these factors were partially offset by the imputation of interest expense on the multiemployer pension withdrawal liability related to the new england pension fund.

liquidity and capital resources operating activities the following is a summary of the significant sources (uses) of cash from operating activities (amounts in millions):
non-cash operating activities(a)                                             5,901               3,318               7,313

(a)   represents depreciation and amortization, gains and losses on derivative and foreign exchange transactions, deferred income taxes, provisions for uncollectible accounts, pension and postretirement benefit expense, stock compensation expense, impairment charges and other non-cash items.
cash from operating activities remained strong throughout the 2012 to 2014 time period. operating cash flow was adversely impacted by $1.527 billion due to certain transactions resulting from the ratification of our collective bargaining agreement with the teamsters in 2014. these transactions are discussed further in the "collective bargaining agreements" section:
•   we paid $2.271 billion to settle postretirement benefit obligations for certain union employees.
•   we paid $176 million in 2014 for retroactive economic benefits under the collective bargaining agreement that were related to the period between august through december of 2013.
•   during 2014, we received cash tax benefits of $920 million from the items described above (through reduced u.s. federal and state quarterly income tax payments).
most of the remaining variability in operating cash flows during the 2012 to 2014 time period relates to the funding of our company-sponsored pension and postretirement benefit plans (and related cash tax deductions). except for discretionary or accelerated fundings of our plans, contributions to our company-sponsored pension plans have largely varied based on whether any minimum funding requirements are present for individual pension plans.
•   in 2014, we made discretionary contributions to our three primary company-sponsored u.s. pension plans totaling $1.042 billion.
•   in 2013, we did not have any required, nor make any discretionary, contributions to our primary company-sponsored pension plans in the u.s.
•   the remaining contributions in the 2012 through 2014 period were largely due to contributions to our international pension plans and u.s. postretirement medical benefit plans.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as discussed further in the "contractual commitments" section, we have minimum funding requirements in the next several years, primarily related to the ups ibt pension, ups retirement and ups pension plans.
apart from the transactions described above, operating cash flow was impacted by changes in our working capital position, payments for income taxes, and changes in hedge margin payables and receivables. in 2014 and 2013, the compressed holiday shipping season resulted in an increase in working capital needs at each year-end period. the cash payments for income taxes were $1.524, $2.712 and $1.988 billion for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and were primarily impacted by the timing of current tax deductions. the net hedge margin collateral received from derivative counterparties was $421, $67 and $4 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, due to the increased net fair value asset position of the derivative contracts used in our currency and interest rate hedging programs.
as of december 31, 2014, the total of our worldwide holdings of cash and cash equivalents was $2.291 billion, of which $1.072 billion was held by foreign subsidiaries. the amount of cash held by our u.s. and foreign subsidiaries fluctuates throughout the year due to a variety of factors, including the timing of cash receipts and disbursements in the normal course of business. cash provided by operating activities in the united states continues to be our primary source of funds to finance domestic operating needs, capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividend payments to shareowners. to the extent that such amounts represent previously untaxed earnings, the cash held by foreign subsidiaries would be subject to tax if such amounts were repatriated in the form of dividends; however, not all international cash balances would have to be repatriated in the form of a dividend if returned to the u.s. when amounts earned by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be indefinitely reinvested, no accrual for taxes is provided.
investing activities our primary sources (uses) of cash for investing activities were as follows (amounts in millions):
capital expenditures:
information technology                                                 (415   )            (442   )            (407   )

proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment                $53                $104                 $95
net (purchases) sales of marketable securities                        $(419   )              $9                $628
cash received (paid) for business acquisitions and dispositions        $(88   )            $(22   )           $(100   )
we have commitments for the purchase of vehicles, equipment and real estate to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth. we generally fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations. future capital spending for anticipated growth and replacement assets will depend on a variety of factors, including economic and industry conditions. we anticipate that our capital expenditures for 2015 will be approximately $3.0 billion.
capital spending on aircraft declined over the 2012 to 2014 period, as we completed the scheduled deliveries of a previous order for the boeing 767-300erf aircraft. capital spending on vehicles increased during the 2012 to 2014 period in our u.s. and international package businesses and our freight unit, due to vehicle replacements, technology enhancements and new vehicle orders to support volume growth. capital expenditures on buildings and facilities also increased in the 2012 to 2014 period, and included hub automation and capacity expansion projects in the u.s. during 2014, as well as expansion and new construction projects at facilities in europe and asia (including a $200 million expansion at our european air hub in cologne, germany that was completed in 2014).
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment were largely due to real estate sales during the 2012 through 2014 period, as well as the proceeds from insurance recoveries in 2013. the net decline in finance receivables in the 2012 through 2014 period was primarily due to customer paydowns and loan sales activity, primarily in our commercial lending, asset-based lending and leasing portfolios. the purchases and sales of marketable securities are largely determined by liquidity needs and the periodic rebalancing of investment types, and will therefore fluctuate from period to period.
the cash paid for business acquisitions in the 2012 to 2014 period was largely due to the acquisitions of kiala s.a. in belgium (2012), cemelog ltd. in hungary (2013), i-parcel llc in the u.s. (2014) and polar speed distribution limited in the u.k. (2014), as well as other smaller acquisitions.
other investing activities are impacted by changes in our restricted cash balances, capital contributions into certain investment partnerships, and various other items. in 2014 and 2013, we increased the restricted cash balance associated with our self-insurance requirements by $17 and $137 million, respectively (there were no changes in restricted cash in 2012, other than earned interest).
financing activities our primary sources (uses) of cash for financing activities were as follows (amounts in millions, except per share data):
number of shares repurchased                        (26.4    )           (43.2    )           (21.8    )
net borrowings (repayments) of debt principal       $(169    )         $(1,775    )          $1,729
capitalization:
total capitalization                              $12,945              $17,360              $17,603
debt to total capitalization %                       83.3    %            62.6    %            73.1    %
on february 14, 2013, the board of directors approved a share repurchase authorization of $10.0 billion, which replaced an authorization previously announced in 2012. the share repurchase authorization has no expiration date. as of december 31, 2014, we had $4.152 billion of this share repurchase authorization remaining. share repurchases may take the form of accelerated share repurchases, open market purchases, or other such methods as we deem appropriate. the timing of our share repurchases will depend upon market conditions. unless terminated earlier by the resolution of our board, the program will expire when we have purchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the program. we anticipate repurchasing approximately $2.7 billion of shares in 2015.
the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on various factors, including our net income, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other relevant factors. we expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends. in february 2015, we increased our quarterly dividend payment from $0.67 to $0.73 per share, a 9% increase.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations issuances of debt in 2014 and 2013 consisted primarily of longer-maturity commercial paper. issuances of debt in 2012 consisted primarily of senior fixed rate note offerings totaling $1.75 billion.
repayments of debt in 2014 and 2013 consisted primarily of the maturity of our $1.0 and $1.75 billion senior fixed rate notes that matured in april 2014 and january 2013, respectively. the remaining repayments of debt during the 2012 through 2014 time period included paydowns of commercial paper and scheduled principal payments on our capitalized lease obligations. we consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and non-scheduled repayments of debt.
we had $772 million of commercial paper outstanding at december 31, 2014, and no commercial paper outstanding at december 31, 2013 and 2012. the amount of commercial paper outstanding fluctuates throughout each year based on daily liquidity needs. the average commercial paper balance was $1.356 billion and the average interest rate paid was 0.10% in 2014 ($1.013 billion and 0.07% in 2013, and $962 million and 0.07% in 2012, respectively).
the variation in cash received from common stock issuances to employees was primarily due to level of stock option exercises in the 2012 through 2014 period.
the cash outflows in other financing activities were impacted by several factors. cash inflows (outflows) from the premium payments and settlements of capped call options for the purchase of ups class b shares were $(47), $(93) and $206 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. cash outflows related to the repurchase of shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations on vested employee stock awards were $224, $253 and $234 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. in 2013, we paid $70 million to purchase the noncontrolling interest in a joint venture that operates in the middle east, turkey and portions of the central asia region. in 2012, we settled several interest rate derivatives that were designated as hedges of the senior fixed-rate debt offerings that year, which resulted in a cash outflow of $70 million.
sources of credit see note 7 to the audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our available credit and debt covenants.
guarantees and other off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity.
contractual commitments we have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of capital leases, operating leases, debt obligations, purchase commitments, and certain other liabilities. we intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations. the following table summarizes the expected cash outflow to satisfy our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31, 2014 (in millions):
commitment type                 2015                2016                2017                2018                2019            after 2019               total capital leases               $75                 $74                 $67                 $62                 $59                $435                  $772
operating leases             323                 257                 210                 150                  90                 274                 1,304
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our capital lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft. capital leases, operating leases, and purchase commitments, as well as our debt principal obligations, are discussed further in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. the amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixed-rate debt, in addition to interest on variable rate debt that was calculated based on interest rates as of december 31, 2014. the calculations of debt interest take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements. for debt denominated in a foreign currency, the u.s. dollar equivalent principal amount of the debt at the end of the year was used as the basis to calculate future interest payments.
purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding, the largest of which are orders for technology equipment and vehicles. as of december 31, 2014, we have no open aircraft orders.
pension fundings represent the anticipated required cash contributions that will be made to our qualified u.s. pension plans (these plans are discussed further in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). the pension funding requirements were estimated under the provisions of the pension protection act of 2006 and the employee retirement income security act of 1974, using discount rates, asset returns and other assumptions appropriate for these plans. in july 2012, federal legislation was signed into law that allows pension plan sponsors to use higher interest rate assumptions (based on a 25-year rate history) in valuing plan liabilities and determining funding obligations. the amount of any minimum funding requirement, as applicable, for these plans could change significantly in future periods, depending on many factors, including future plan asset returns and discount rates. a sustained significant decline in the world equity markets, and the resulting impact on our pension assets and investment returns, could result in our domestic pension plans being subject to significantly higher minimum funding requirements. to the extent that the funded status of these plans in future years differs from our current projections, the actual contributions made in future years could materially differ from the amounts shown in the table above.
as discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, we are not currently subject to any minimum contributions or surcharges with respect to the multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans in which we participate. contribution rates to these multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans are established through the collective bargaining process. as we are not subject to any minimum contribution levels, we have not included any amounts in the contractual commitments table with respect to these multiemployer plans.
the contractual payments due for "other liabilities" primarily include commitment payments related to our investment in certain partnerships. the table above does not include approximately $217 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions because we are uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled in cash. in addition, we also have recognized assets associated with uncertain tax positions in excess of the related liabilities such that we do not believe a net contractual obligation exists to the taxing authorities. uncertain tax positions are further discussed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
as of december 31, 2014, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $1.064 billion issued in connection with our self-insurance reserves and other routine business requirements. we also issue surety bonds as an alternative to letters of credit in certain instances, and as of december 31, 2014, we had $640 million of surety bonds written. as of december 31, 2014, we had unfunded loan commitments totaling $136 million associated with our financial business.
we believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long-term needs for the operation of our business, including anticipated capital expenditures, for the foreseeable future.
contingencies see note 8 to the audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of judicial proceedings and other matters arising from the conduct of our business activities, and note 12 for a discussion of income tax related matters.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations collective bargaining agreements status of collective bargaining agreements as of december 31, 2014, we had approximately 270,000 employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the international brotherhood of teamsters ("teamsters"). during 2014, the teamsters ratified a new national master agreement ("nma") with ups that will expire on july 31, 2018. the economic provisions in the nma included wage rate increases, as well as increased contribution rates for healthcare and pension benefits. most of these economic provisions were retroactive to august 1, 2013, which was the effective date of the nma. in the second quarter of 2014, we remitted $278 million for these retroactive economic benefits; this payment had an immaterial impact on net income, as these retroactive economic benefits had been accrued since the july 31, 2013 expiration of the prior agreement.
in addition to the retroactive economic provisions of the nma, there were certain changes to the delivery of healthcare benefits that were effective at various dates. these changes impact approximately 36,000 full-time and 73,000 part-time active employees covered by the nma and the ups freight collective bargaining agreement (collectively referred to as the "nma group"), as well as approximately 16,000 employees covered by other collective bargaining agreements (the "non-nma group"). these provisions are discussed further below in the "changes to the delivery of active and postretirement healthcare benefits" section.
we have approximately 2,600 pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the independent pilots association ("ipa"), which became amendable at the end of 2011. in february 2014, ups and the ipa requested and received mediation by the national mediation board for the ongoing contract negotiations.
our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local 2727, which became amendable november 1, 2013. in addition, approximately 3,100 of our auto and maintenance mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers ("iam"). in 2014, the iam ratified new collective bargaining agreements that will expire on july 31, 2019.
multiemployer benefit plans we contribute to a number of multiemployer defined benefit and health and welfare plans under terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover our union represented employees. our current collective bargaining agreements set forth the annual contribution increases allotted to the plans that we participate in, and we are in compliance with these contribution rates. these limitations will remain in effect throughout the terms of the existing collective bargaining agreements.
changes to the delivery of active and postretirement healthcare benefits prior to ratification, the nma group and non-nma group employees received their healthcare benefits through ups-sponsored active and postretirement health and welfare benefit plans. effective june 1, 2014, we ceased providing healthcare benefits to active nma group employees through these ups-sponsored benefit plans, and the responsibility for providing healthcare benefits for active employees was assumed by three separate multiemployer healthcare funds (the "funds"). the responsibility for providing healthcare benefits for the active non-nma group employees was also assumed by the funds on various dates up to january 1, 2015, depending on the ratification date of the applicable collective bargaining agreement. we will make contributions to the funds based on negotiated fixed hourly or monthly contribution rates for the duration of the nma and other applicable collective bargaining agreements.
additionally, the funds assumed the obligation to provide postretirement healthcare benefits to the employees in the nma group who retire on or after january 1, 2014. the postretirement healthcare benefit obligation for the employees in the non-nma group was assumed by the funds for employees retiring on or after january 1, 2014 or january 1, 2015, depending on the applicable collective bargaining agreement. in exchange for the assumption of the obligation to provide postretirement healthcare benefits to the nma group and non-nma group, we transferred cash totaling $2.271 billion to the funds in the second quarter of 2014. ups-sponsored health and welfare benefit plans retained responsibility for providing postretirement healthcare coverage for employees in the nma group who retired from ups prior to january 1, 2014, and for employees in the non-nma group who retire from ups prior to the january 1, 2014 or january 1, 2015 effective date in the applicable collective bargaining agreement.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations accounting impact of health and welfare plan changes income statement impact:
we recorded a pre-tax charge of $1.066 billion ($665 million after-tax) in the second quarter of 2014 for the health and welfare plan changes described above. the components of this charge, which was included in "compensation and benefits" expense in the statement of consolidated income, are as follows:
•   partial plan curtailment: we recorded a $112 million pre-tax curtailment loss due to the elimination of future service benefit accruals. this curtailment loss represents the accelerated recognition of unamortized prior service costs.
•   remeasurement of postretirement obligation: we recorded a $746 million pre-tax loss due to the remeasurement of the postretirement benefit obligations of the affected ups-sponsored health and welfare benefit plans.
•   settlement: we recorded a $208 million pre-tax settlement loss, which represents the recognition of unamortized actuarial losses associated with the postretirement obligation for the nma group.
we recorded an additional pre-tax charge of $36 million ($22 million after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2014 upon ratification of the collective bargaining agreements covering the non-nma group, related to the remeasurement and settlement of the postretirement benefit obligation associated with those employees.
balance sheet and cash flow impact:
during 2014, as part of the health and welfare plan changes described previously, we transferred cash totaling $2.271 billion to the funds, which was accounted for as a settlement of our postretirement benefit obligations (see note 4 to the audited consolidated financial statements). we received approximately $854 million of cash tax benefits (through reduced u.s. federal and state quarterly income tax payments) in 2014.
for nma group employees who retired prior to january 1, 2014 and remained with the ups-sponsored health and welfare plans, the changes to the contributions, benefits and cost sharing provisions in these plans resulted in an increase in the postretirement benefit obligation, and a corresponding decrease in pre-tax accumulated other comprehensive income, of $13 million upon ratification.
anticipated benefits of health and welfare plan changes we believe we have obtained several benefits as a result of these health and welfare plan changes, including:
•   liability transfer: we have removed a significant liability from our balance sheet, which helps to reduce uncertainty around potential changes to healthcare laws and regulations, control the volatility of healthcare inflation, and removes the risk associated with providing future retiree healthcare.
•   negotiated healthcare costs: using the model of a defined contribution plan allows us to negotiate our contributions towards healthcare costs going forward, and provides more certainty of costs over the contract period.
•   minimize impact of healthcare law changes: multiemployer plans have several advantages under the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010, including reduced transitional fees and the ability to limit the impact of future excise taxes.
•   mitigate demographic issues: this helps reduce the potential impact of increased early retirements by employees.
agreement with the new england teamsters and trucking industry pension fund in the third quarter of 2012, we reached an agreement with the new england pension fund, a multiemployer pension plan in which ups is a participant, to restructure the pension liabilities for approximately 10,200 ups employees represented by the teamsters. the agreement reflects a decision by the new england pension fund's trustees to restructure the fund through plan amendments to utilize a "two pool approach", which effectively subdivides the plan assets and liabilities between two groups of beneficiaries. as part of this agreement, ups agreed to withdraw from the original pool of the new england pension fund of which it had historically been a participant, and reenter the new england pension fund's newly-established pool as a new employer.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations upon ratification of the agreement by the teamsters in september 2012, we withdrew from the original pool of the new england pension fund and incurred an undiscounted withdrawal liability of $2.162 billion to be paid in equal monthly installments over 50 years. the undiscounted withdrawal liability was calculated by independent actuaries employed by the new england pension fund, in accordance with the governing plan documents and the applicable requirements of the employee retirement income security act of 1974. in the third quarter of 2012, we recorded a charge to expense to establish an $896 million withdrawal liability on our balance sheet, which represents the present value of the $2.162 billion future payment obligation discounted at a 4.25% interest rate. this discount rate represents the estimated credit-adjusted market rate of interest at which we could obtain financing of a similar maturity and seniority.
as part of this agreement, we believe that ups, the new england pension fund and our affected employees have obtained several benefits, including:
•   the old pool of the new england pension fund has historically had, and would likely continue to have, funding challenges; this represented a risk to ups of having to face higher future contribution requirements, as well as a risk to the security of the pension benefits of those ups employees who participate in the new england pension fund. the 50 year fixed payment obligation should improve the funded status of the new england pension fund over time, while reducing the risk to ups of significantly higher future contribution requirements.
•   the newly-established pool provides better protections for new participating employers. this pool uses a direct-attribution methodology for calculating any potential future withdrawal liabilities, which reduces our exposure to the liabilities of other participating employers. additionally, this pool contains provisions designed to maintain a fully-funded status, including automatic benefit reductions and/or increased employee contributions in the event of an underfunded situation occurring.
•   as part of the agreement, we were able to freeze our hourly pension contribution rate to the newly-established pool of the new england pension fund for a period of 10 years, which provides cash flow visibility for both ups and the new england pension fund.
the $896 million charge to expense recorded in the third quarter of 2012 is included in "compensation and benefits expense" in the statement of consolidated income, while the corresponding withdrawal liability is included in "other non-current liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheet. we will impute interest on the withdrawal liability using the 4.25% discount rate, while the monthly payments made to the new england pension fund will reduce the remaining balance of the withdrawal liability.
our status in the newly-established pool of the new england pension fund is accounted for as the participation in a new multiemployer pension plan, and therefore we will recognize expense based on the contractually-required contribution for each period, and we will recognize a liability for any contributions due and unpaid at the end of a reporting period.
rate adjustments in october 2014, we announced an average 4.9% net increase in base and accessorial rates that took effect december 29, 2014, and impacted the following services:
•   ups ground services;
•   ups next day air, ups 2nd day air, ups 3 day select, and international air shipments originating in the united states (including worldwide express, worldwide express plus, ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service);
additionally, the pricing change involving the application of dimensional weight pricing to all ups ground services took effect on december 29, 2014 as well.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations these rate changes are customary and occur on an annual basis. rate changes for shipments originating outside the u.s. are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market.

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. as indicated in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles. we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances. actual results could differ from our estimates, which would affect the related amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts, we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.
contingencies as discussed in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements, we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies. the events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable. at the time a contingency is identified, we consider all relevant facts as part of our evaluation. we record a liability for a loss when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable. events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability. these factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. contingent losses that are probable and estimable, excluding those related to income taxes and self-insurance which are discussed further below, were not material to our financial position or results of operations as of, and for the year ended, december 31, 2014. in addition, we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of december 31, 2014, because a loss is not reasonably estimable.
goodwill and intangible impairment we perform impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units on an annual basis. our reporting units are comprised of the europe, asia, americas and ismea (indian subcontinent, middle east and africa) reporting units in the international package reporting segment, and the forwarding, logistics, ups freight, the ups store and ups capital reporting units in the supply chain & freight reporting segment. our annual goodwill impairment testing date is october 1st for each reporting unit. in assessing goodwill for impairment, we initially evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive and it is necessary to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit, then we utilize a two-step process to test goodwill for impairment. first, a comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying value, including goodwill, is performed. if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. the second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model ("dcf model"), and supplement this with observable valuation multiples for comparable companies, as applicable. the completion of the dcf model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows. these assumptions include projections of future revenue, costs and working capital changes. in addition, we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables, as required, in estimating the fair value of our reporting units. the projections that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units. the determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in these assumptions, and changes in our business strategy, government regulations, or economic or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments. we will continue to monitor market conditions and other factors to determine if interim impairment tests are necessary in future periods. if impairment indicators are present in future periods, the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations.
none of the reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2014, 2013 or 2012. changes in our forecasts could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. a 10% decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units as of our most recent goodwill testing date (october 1, 2014) would not result in a goodwill impairment charge.
licenses with a carrying value of $5 million as of december 31, 2014 are deemed to be indefinite-lived intangibles, and therefore are not amortized. impairment tests for indefinite-lived intangibles are performed on an annual basis. all of our remaining recorded intangible assets are deemed to be finite-lived intangibles, and are thus amortized over their estimated useful lives. impairment tests for these intangible assets are only performed when a triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the intangible. if the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recorded. fair values are determined based on a dcf model. we incurred impairment charges on intangible assets of $13 million during 2013, while there were no impairments of any indefinite-lived or finite-lived intangible assets in 2014 or 2012.
self-insurance accruals we self-insure costs associated with workers' compensation claims, automotive liability, health and welfare and general business liabilities, up to certain limits. insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. recorded balances are based on reserve levels, which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves. we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate, but actual experience in claim frequency and/or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations.
workers' compensation, automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle. consequently, actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims. a number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open, trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation. furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. changes in state legislation with respect to workers' compensation can affect the adequacy of our self-insurance accruals. all of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results.
we sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees. these liabilities and related expenses are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans, anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation. actual results may differ from these estimates and, therefore, produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pension and postretirement medical benefits our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. these assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, compensation increase rates, expected returns on plan assets, mortality rates and other factors. the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans represent our best estimates, and we believe that they are reasonable, based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends.
differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense. the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are (1) changes in the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date, (2) differences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets, (3) changes in demographic assumptions including mortality and (4) participant experience different from demographic assumptions.
we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of a corridor (defined as 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans' projected benefit obligations) in pension expense annually at december 31st each year. the remaining components of pension expense (herein referred to as "ongoing net periodic benefit cost"), primarily service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets, are recorded on a quarterly basis.
the following sensitivity analysis shows the impact of a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate, return on assets, and healthcare cost trend rate for our pension and postretirement benefit plans, and the resulting increase (decrease) on our obligations and expense as of, and for the year ended, december 31, 2014 (in millions).

expense is expected to increase in 2015 compared with 2014, due primarily to the decrease in the weighted-average discount rate used to determine ongoing net periodic benefit cost from 5.24% for 2014 to 4.36% for 2015 (these discount rates represent the combined weighted-average discount rates for our u.s. and international pension plans, as well as our u.s. postretirement medical plans).
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations depreciation, residual value and impairment of fixed assets as of december 31, 2014, we had $18.281 billion of net fixed assets, the most significant category of which is aircraft. in accounting for fixed assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets.
in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft, we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types. subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program, changes in the utilization of the aircraft, governmental regulations on aging aircraft and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary. adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense.
we review long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset. if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recorded. fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows or external appraisals, as applicable. we review long-lived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified. the circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include, but are not limited to, a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. in estimating cash flows, we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business. adverse changes in these volume forecasts, or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections, could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand. this situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type, resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type (thus resulting in increased depreciation expense).
there were no impairment charges on our property, plant and equipment during 2014, 2013 and 2012.
fair value measurements in the normal course of business, we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk, including derivatives, marketable securities, finance receivables, other investments and debt. certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value, principally derivatives, marketable securities, pension assets and certain other investments. fair values are based on listed market prices, when such prices are available. to the extent that listed market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on other relevant factors, including dealer price quotations. certain financial instruments, including over-the-counter derivative instruments, are valued using pricing models that consider, among other factors, contractual and market prices, correlations, time value, credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors. changes in the fixed income, equity, foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future, potentially affecting our results of operations. a quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices is presented in the "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" section of this report.
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction, tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions. significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.
we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. if recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. however, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. once it is determined that the position meets the recognition threshold, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
allowance for doubtful accounts losses on accounts receivable are recognized when they are incurred, which requires us to make our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our customer receivables at each balance sheet date. these estimates require consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions, trends in customer payment frequency, and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data, including present economic conditions and the financial health of specific customers and market sectors. our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major account exposures and concentrations of risk. deterioration in macroeconomic variables could result in our ultimate loss exposures on our accounts receivable being significantly higher than what we have currently estimated and reserved for in our allowance for doubtful accounts. our total allowance for doubtful accounts as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 was $121 and $122 million, respectively. our total provision for doubtful accounts charged to expense during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $143, $129 and $155 million, respectively.

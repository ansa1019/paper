item 7:   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is intended to facilitate an understanding of applied's business and results of operations. this md&a should be read in conjunction with applied's consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k. the following discussion contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement set forth at the beginning of this form 10-k. md&a consists of the following sections:
•   overview: a summary of applied's business and measurements
•   results of operations: a discussion of operating results
•   segment information: a discussion of segment operating results
•   business combinations: a summary of announced or completed business combinations and acquisitions
•   recent accounting pronouncements: a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and its impact to applied's consolidated financial statements
•   financial condition, liquidity and capital resources: an analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash
•   off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations
•   critical accounting policies and estimates: a discussion of critical accounting policies that require the exercise of judgments and estimates
•   non-gaap adjusted results: a presentation of results reconciling gaap to non-gaap adjusted measures overview applied provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the global semiconductor, display, solar photovoltaic (pv) and related industries. applied's customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips, liquid crystal and other displays, solar pv cells and modules, and other electronic devices. these customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components. applied operates in four reportable segments: silicon systems, applied global services, display, and energy and environmental solutions. a summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements. a discussion of factors that could affect applied's operations is set forth under "risk factors" in part i, item 1a, which is incorporated herein by reference. product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in the united states, europe, israel, and asia. applied's broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force.
applied's results are driven primarily by worldwide demand for semiconductors, which in turn depends on end-user demand for electronic products. each of applied's businesses is subject to cyclical industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips, display technologies, solar pvs and other electronic devices, as well as other factors, such as global economic and market conditions, and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes. in addition, a significant driver in the semiconductor and display industries is end-demand for mobile consumer products, which is characterized by seasonality that impacts the timing of customer investments in manufacturing equipment and, in turn, applied's business. in light of these conditions, applied's results can vary significantly year-over-year, as well as quarter-over-quarter.
applied's strategic priorities for fiscal 2016 include developing products that help solve customers' challenges at technology inflections; expanding its served market opportunities in the semiconductor and display industries; and growing its services business.
on april 26, 2015, applied and tokyo electron limited (tel) announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate their previously announced business combination agreement, which was entered into on september 24, 2013 and intended to effect a strategic combination of their respective business into a new combined company. no termination fee was payable by either applied or tel.
results of operations the following table presents certain significant measurements for the past three fiscal years:

reconciliations of non-gaap adjusted measures are presented under "non-gaap adjusted results" below. fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 each contained 52 weeks.
mobility, and the increasing technological functionality of mobile devices, continues to be the largest drivers of semiconductor industry spending. fiscal 2015 was characterized by steady demand for semiconductor equipment, with increased investment in technology upgrades and additional capacity by memory customers. demand from foundry customers reflected investments in new technology at advanced nodes, driven by demand for advanced mobile chips. mobility represented a significant driver of display industry spending during fiscal 2015, which resulted in continued manufacturing capacity expansion for mobile applications. demand for larger tvs was also a factor for display industry investments, although demand for tv manufacturing equipment remains susceptible to highly cyclical conditions. investment in solar equipment remained low during fiscal 2015 due to ongoing excess manufacturing capacity in the industry. gross margin challenges are expected in the first half of fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher demand for semiconductor equipment from memory customers and mobility display equipment.
applied expects the mobility trend to remain the main growth driver for the semiconductor industry, and in turn for silicon systems, in fiscal 2016. demand in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry is expected to be driven by foundry and memory spending. applied also expects semiconductor spares and services, and display equipment investment to remain healthy in fiscal 2016.
during fiscal 2014, demand for advanced mobile chips drove demand for semiconductor equipment by foundry customers. in addition, demand for semiconductor equipment from memory customers improved as manufacturers invested in technology upgrades. mobility and demand for larger tvs drove investment in display equipment during fiscal 2014. investment in solar equipment remained low during fiscal 2014, despite continued end-market growth, due to excess manufacturing capacity in the industry.
fiscal 2013 was characterized by strong demand for semiconductor equipment from foundry customers driven by demand for advanced mobile chips. in the second half of fiscal 2013, demand from foundry customers softened, while demand from memory and logic customers improved. display industry spending during fiscal 2013 reflected strong demand for mobile display equipment, as well as a recovery in demand for tv manufacturing equipment compared to weak industry levels in fiscal 2012. investment in solar equipment remained low during fiscal 2013 due to continued excess manufacturing capacity in the industry.

new orders for fiscal 2015 slightly increased from fiscal 2014 due to higher demand for semiconductor equipment, and semiconductor spares and services, partially offset by lower demand for display and solar equipment. new orders for silicon systems and applied global services continued to comprise the majority of applied's consolidated total new orders.
new orders increased in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 across all segments, primarily due to higher demand for semiconductor equipment, semiconductor spares and services, and display equipment.
new orders by geographic region for each fiscal year, determined by the product shipment destination specified by the customer, were as follows:
change the changes in new orders from customers in korea, japan, the united states and europe in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, and changes in new orders from customers in the united states, japan, taiwan and korea for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, primarily reflected changes in customer mix for the silicon systems segment. the increase in new orders in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 from china resulted from increased demand from display manufacturing equipment.
changes in backlog during each fiscal year were as follows:
net adjustments          (220   )             (31   )
backlog consists of: (1) orders for which written authorizations have been accepted and assigned shipment dates are within the next 12 months, or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized; and (2) contractual service revenue and maintenance fees to be earned within the next 12 months. applied's backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods, due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders. approximately 70 percent of the backlog as of the end of fiscal 2015 is anticipated to be shipped within the first two quarters of fiscal 2016.
applied's backlog was $3.1 billion at october 25, 2015 compared to $2.9 billion at october 26, 2014. backlog adjustments were negative for fiscal 2015 and totaled $220 million, primarily consisting of order cancellations, unfavorable foreign currency impacts and other adjustments.
backlog by reportable segment as of the end of each fiscal year was as follows:

net sales increased in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to greater customer investments in semiconductor equipment, semiconductor spares and services, 200mm equipment systems and display equipment. the silicon systems segment remains the largest contributor of net sales.
net sales for all segments increased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. the increase primarily reflected increased customer investments in semiconductor and display equipment, as well as semiconductor spares and services.
net sales by geographic region for each fiscal year, determined by the location of customers' facilities to which products were shipped, were as follows:
change
(1)   amount of net sales attributed to each geographic region differ from those included in applied's press release issued on november 12, 2015. these reclassifications did not affect applied's previously announced financial results as total net sales remain unchanged.
the changes in net sales from customers in korea, japan and taiwan in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily reflected changes in customer mix for semiconductor equipment. the decrease in net sales from customers in the united states was due to lower customer spending on semiconductor equipment, partially offset by increased spending on semiconductor spares and services, and 200mm equipment.
net sales from customers in china increased for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to greater investments in semiconductor, display and solar manufacturing equipment, while net sales from customers in the united states increased due to higher investments in semiconductor equipment.
gross margin gross profit and gross margin for each fiscal year were as follows:
change gross profit                        $3,952              $3,843              $2,991                  $109                     $852

non-gaap adjusted gross margin        42.9   %            44.1   %            42.1   %             (1.2) points               2.0 points reconciliations of non-gaap adjusted measures are presented under "non-gaap adjusted results" below.
gross profit and non-gaap adjusted gross profit in fiscal 2015 increased compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to higher net sales, while gross margin and non-gaap adjusted gross margin decreased primarily due to unfavorable changes in product mix and the absence of a recovery of a regional customs duty assessment charge recorded in fiscal 2014.
gross profit and gross margin and non-gaap adjusted gross profit and non-gaap adjusted gross margin increased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily reflecting higher net sales, the recovery of a regional customs duty assessment charge recorded in fiscal 2013, sales of display and solar tools that had been previously written down, lower manufacturing costs and change in product mix. gross profit and non-gaap adjusted gross profit during fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 included $57 million, $53 million and $50 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.
research, development and engineering research, development and engineering (rd&e) expenses for each fiscal year were as follows:
change research, development and engineering      $1,451              $1,428              $1,320          $23                     $108
applied's future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products it provides. development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product, which typically has a shorter development cycle, or a new product, which typically has a longer development cycle. most of applied's existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies, materials and processes. in certain instances, applied acquires technologies, either in existing or new product areas, to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market.
management believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in rd&e to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers' most advanced designs. applied has maintained and intends to continue its commitment to investing in rd&e in order to continue to offer new products and technologies.
in fiscal 2015, applied increased its investments in new product growth in etch, chemical vapor deposition, high throughput atomic layer deposition, and next generation inspection technology. applied's investments in etch and chemical vapor deposition were focused on supporting the adoption of the etch centris sym 3 product and customer ramps of 3d nand technology.  applied's investment in atomic layer deposition is yielding products to address customer needs for future nodes, and investments in inspection include a new e-beam inspection platform and improved brightfield capabilities.
rd&e expenses increased in fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year and also in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, reflecting the impact of ongoing product development initiatives. as part of its growth strategy, applied continued to reprioritize existing spend, to enable increased funding for investments in technical capabilities and critical rd&e programs in current and new markets, with a focus on semiconductor technologies. rd&e expense during fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 included $69 million, $66 million and $53 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.
marketing and selling marketing and selling expenses for each fiscal year were as follows:
change marketing and selling      $428              $423              $433          $5                      $(10          )
marketing and selling expenses remained relatively flat in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 due to continued cost management efforts. the decrease in marketing and selling expenses for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was mainly due to headcount reductions. marketing and selling expenses during fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 included $26 million, $23 million and $20 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.
change general and administrative (g&a) expenses for fiscal 2015 decreased compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to lower acquisition-related and integration costs related to the terminated business combination with tel, which was terminated in april 2015, and continued cost management efforts. g&a expenses for fiscal 2014 increased compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to integration planning costs associated with the terminated business combination with tel, partially offset by proceeds from a favorable litigation outcome. g&a expenses during fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 included $35 million, $35 million and $34 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.
loss (gain) on derivatives associated with terminated business combination change loss (gain) on derivatives associated with terminated business combination   $(89      )       $(30      )          $7          $(59          )         $(37          )
changes in gain or loss on derivatives associated with the terminated business combination with tel resulted from the sale of derivative contracts and exchange rate fluctuations. due to the termination of the proposed business combination, the derivatives were sold during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. for further details, see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and 2014, applied performed a qualitative assessment to test goodwill for all of its reporting units for impairment. applied determined that it was more likely than not that each of its reporting units' fair values exceeded its respective carrying values and that it was not necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test for any of its reporting units.
during fiscal 2013, the solar industry faced continued deterioration in market conditions associated with manufacturing overcapacity and weak operating performance and outlook, resulting in uncertainties regarding the timing and nature of a recovery in solar capital equipment expenditures. applied performed a two-step goodwill impairment test and, as a result, recorded $224 million of goodwill impairment charges in its energy and environmental solutions segment in fiscal 2013. applied also recorded a $54 million impairment charge related to intangible assets in the energy and environmental solutions segment in fiscal 2013.
the evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment requires the exercise of significant judgment. in the event of future changes in business conditions, applied will reassess and update its forecasts and estimates used in future impairment analyses. if the results of these analyses are lower than current estimates, a material impairment charge may result at that time.
for further details, see note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
restructuring and asset impairments restructuring and asset impairment expenses for each fiscal year were as follows:
change restructuring and asset impairments, net     $14              $5             $63          $9                      $(58          )
the increase in restructuring and asset impairments, net for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to the cost reduction measures in the solar business taken during fiscal 2015 to achieve a lower break-even level and improve business performance. the decrease in restructuring and asset impairments, net for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was due to completion of the principal activities for the previously announced restructuring plans. also in fiscal 2013, applied incurred $2 million of severance and other employee-related costs in connection with the integration of varian semiconductor equipment associates, inc.
on october 3, 2012, applied announced a restructuring plan (the 2012 global restructuring plan) to realign its global workforce and enhance its ability to invest for growth. under this plan, applied implemented a voluntary retirement program and other workforce reduction actions that affected approximately 1,300 positions. as of january 26, 2014, principal activities related to this plan were complete. during fiscal 2014 and 2013, applied recognized $5 million and $39 million, respectively, of employee-related costs in connection with the 2012 global restructuring plan. total costs incurred in implementing this plan were $150 million, none of which were allocated to the operating segments.
on may 10, 2012, applied announced a plan (the 2012 ees restructuring plan) to restructure its energy and environmental solutions segment in light of challenging industry conditions affecting the solar photovoltaic and light-emitting diode (led) equipment markets. total costs incurred in implementing this plan were $87 million, of which $13 million were inventory-related charges. during fiscal 2015, applied recorded a favorable adjustment of $2 million associated with restructuring reserves under this program. during fiscal 2013, applied recognized $26 million, of restructuring and asset impairment charges in connection with the 2012 ees restructuring plan. these costs were reported in the energy and environmental solutions and applied global services segments.
for further details, see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
change interest expenses incurred during the past three fiscal years were primarily associated with senior unsecured notes that were issued in june 2011 to fund a portion of the consideration and certain costs associated with the acquisition of varian. interest expense for fiscal 2015 increased compared to fiscal 2014 due to the issuance of senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1.8 billion in september 2015. interest expense remained flat during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013.
interest income primarily includes interest earned on cash and investments and realized gains on sale of securities. interest and other income, net, decreased in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to lower realized gains on sales of strategic investments in fiscal 2015. interest and other income, net, increased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to an increase in realized gains on sales of securities recorded during fiscal 2014, partially offset by increased impairments of strategic investments.
change effective income tax rate       13.8   %          26.0   %        26.9   %       (12.2) points                  (0.9) points applied's effective tax rate is affected by the geographical composition of income, which includes jurisdictions with income tax incentives and differing tax rates. it is also affected by events that are not consistent from period to period, such as changes in income tax laws and regulations and the resolution of income tax filings.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was lower than the rate for fiscal 2014 primarily due to acquisition costs that became deductible in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 as a result of the termination of the proposed business combination with tel, an adjustment in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 to correct an error in the recognition of cost of sales in the u.s. related to intercompany sales, reinstatement of the u.s. federal research and development tax credit during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 which was retroactive to its expiration in december 2013, resolutions and changes related to income tax liabilities for prior years, and changes in the geographical composition of income.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was lower than the rate for fiscal 2013 due primarily to nondeductible goodwill impairment charges in fiscal 2013, offset by resolutions and changes related to prior years and expiration of the u.s. federal research and development tax credit.
segment information applied reports financial results in four segments: silicon systems, applied global services, display, and energy and environmental solutions. a description of the products and services, as well as financial data, for each reportable segment can be found in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements. applied does not allocate to its reportable segments certain operating expenses that it manages separately at the corporate level. these unallocated costs include costs for share-based compensation; certain management, finance, legal, human resource, and rd&e functions provided at the corporate level; and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy. in addition, applied does not allocate to its reportable segments restructuring and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions, unless these actions pertain to a specific reportable segment.
silicon systems segment the silicon systems segment includes semiconductor capital equipment for deposition, etch, ion implantation, rapid thermal processing, chemical mechanical planarization, metrology and inspection, and wafer packaging. development efforts are focused on solving customers' key technical challenges in transistor, patterning, interconnect and packaging performance as devices scale to advanced technology nodes. the mobility trend remains the largest influence on industry spending, as it drives device manufacturers to continually improve their ability to deliver high-performance, low-power processors and affordable solid-state storage in a small form factor.
the competitive environment for silicon systems in fiscal 2015 reflected continued investment by semiconductor manufacturers. memory manufacturers increased investments in technology upgrades and additional capacity. foundry investments reflected demand for new technology as customers ramp wafer starts at advanced nodes to meet demand for advanced mobile chips, but decreased primarily due to customers managing excess inventory, improving yields and re-using equipment.

the composition of new orders for silicon systems by end use application for the past three fiscal years was as follows:
one region accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the silicon systems segment for one or more of the past three fiscal years:
change customers in taiwan accounted for 32 percent, 37 percent and 45 percent of total net sales for silicon systems in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. customers in the united states, china and korea together contributed 47 percent, 47 percent and 37 percent of the total net sales for this segment in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
financial results in the silicon systems segment for fiscal 2015 reflected continued wafer fabrication equipment spending in the semiconductor industry. the increase in new orders and net sales in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily reflected increased demand and spending from memory customers, partially offset by lower demand and spending from foundry customers. two customers accounted for approximately 41 percent of net sales and three customers accounted for 53 percent of new orders in this segment in fiscal 2015. operating income and non-gaap adjusted operating income for fiscal 2015 increased compared to fiscal 2014, reflecting the increase in net sales, partially offset by changes in product mix and higher research and development expenses.
the increase in new orders and net sales in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily reflected increased demand and spending from memory customers, as well as continued demand from foundry customers. three customers accounted for approximately 54 percent of net sales and three customers accounted for 75 percent of new orders in this segment in fiscal 2014. operating income and non-gaap adjusted operating income for fiscal 2014 increased compared to fiscal 2013, reflecting the increase in net sales, partially offset by changes in product mix and higher research and development expenses.
applied global services segment the applied global services segment encompasses integrated solutions to optimize equipment and fab performance and productivity, including spares, upgrades, services, remanufactured earlier generation equipment and factory automation software for semiconductor, display and solar products. customer demand for products and services is fulfilled through a global distribution system with trained service engineers located in close proximity to customer sites.
industry conditions that affected applied global services' sales of spares and services during fiscal 2015 were principally semiconductor manufacturers' wafer starts, as well as utilization rates.
certain significant measures for each fiscal year were as follows:

there were no individual regions that accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the applied global services segment for any of the past three fiscal years.
new orders and net sales for fiscal 2015 increased compared to fiscal 2014 mainly due to higher demand for semiconductor spares and services, and 200mm equipment systems. operating income, operating margin, non-gaap adjusted operating income, and non-gaap adjusted operating margin increased in fiscal 2015 compared fiscal 2014, reflecting the increase in net sales, which was partially offset by unfavorable product mix and the absence of a recovery of a regional customs duty assessment charge recorded in fiscal 2014.
new orders and net sales for fiscal 2014 increased compared to fiscal 2013 mainly due to increased demand for semiconductor spares and services, as well as 200mm equipment systems and equipment upgrades. operating income and non-gaap adjusted operating income increased in fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year, reflecting the increase in net sales as well as the recovery of a regional customs duty assessment charge recorded in fiscal 2013.
display segment the display segment encompasses products for manufacturing liquid crystal displays (lcds), organic light-emitting diodes (oleds), and other display technologies for tvs, personal computers (pcs), tablets, smart phones, and other consumer-oriented devices. the segment is focused on expanding its presence through technologically-differentiated equipment for manufacturing large-scale tvs; new markets such as low temperature polysilicon (ltps), metal oxide, and touch panel sectors; and development of products that enable cost reductions through productivity and uniformity. display industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced lcd tvs and high resolution displays for next generation mobile devices.
the market environment for applied's display segment in fiscal 2015 has been characterized by continued demand for manufacturing equipment for tv and high-end mobile devices, although this sector remains susceptible to highly cyclical conditions. uneven order and revenue patterns in the display segment can cause significant fluctuations quarter-over-quarter, as well as year-over year.
certain significant measures for each fiscal year were as follows:

the following regions accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the display segment for one or more of the past three fiscal years:
change in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, customers in china accounted for 75 percent, 80 percent and 48 percent, respectively, of the display segment's total net sales. customers in korea accounted for 18 percent, 16 percent and 32 percent of total net sales for the display segment in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the increase in net sales from customers in china reflected tv manufacturing capacity expansion, while the increase in net sales from customers in korea increasingly related to sales of mobile display manufacturing equipment.
new orders for fiscal 2015 decreased compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to lower tv manufacturing equipment orders, while net sales for fiscal 2015 were higher due to the timing of shipments. operating income and non-gaap adjusted operating income increased for fiscal 2015 from fiscal 2014, reflecting higher net sales. operating margin and non-gaap adjusted operating margin decreased, despite the increase in net sales, primarily due to unfavorable product mix, increased research and development expenses and the sale of tools in fiscal 2014 for which inventory had been previously fully reserved. four customers accounted for approximately 65 percent of new orders for the display segment in fiscal 2015, with two customers accounting for approximately 37 percent of new orders. four customers accounted for approximately 79 percent of net sales for this segment in fiscal 2015, with two customers accounting for approximately 46 percent of net sales.
new orders and net sales for fiscal 2014 increased compared to fiscal 2013, reflecting strong tv manufacturing capacity expansions. operating income and non-gaap adjusted operating income increased over the prior year, due primarily to higher net sales, sales of tools for which inventory had been written down previously, better installation and warranty performance, and material and manufacturing cost reductions, partially offset by increased research and development expenses. four customers accounted for approximately 87 percent of new orders for the display segment in fiscal 2014, with two customers accounting for approximately 50 percent of new orders. four customers accounted for approximately 77 percent of net sales for this segment in fiscal 2014, with one customer accounting for approximately 40 percent of net sales.
energy and environmental solutions segment the energy and environmental solutions segment includes products for fabricating crystalline-silicon (c-si) solar pv wafers and cells, as well as high throughput roll-to-roll deposition equipment for flexible electronics, packaging and other applications. while end-demand for solar pvs has been robust over the last several years, investment in capital equipment has remained low as global pv production capacity exceeds anticipated demand.
certain significant measures for each fiscal year were as follows:

the following regions accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the energy and environmental solutions segment for one or more of these recent fiscal periods:
change in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, customers in china accounted for 33 percent, 62 percent and 58 percent, respectively, of total net sales for the energy and environmental solutions segment.
financial results during fiscal 2015 remained at low levels due to continued excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry, which resulted in low levels of new orders and net sales, and consequently an operating loss for the segment. two customers accounted for approximately 20 percent of net sales for this segment during fiscal 2015. operating loss for fiscal 2015 included $17 million in restructuring charges and asset impairments and $32 million of inventory charges recorded in cost of products sold, related to cost reduction measures taken in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. details on restructuring charges and asset impairments are included in note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
new orders and net sales for fiscal 2014 increased compared to fiscal 2013 but remained at low levels, reflecting excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry. one customer accounted for approximately 23 percent of net sales for this segment during fiscal 2014. operating margin and non-gaap adjusted operating margin increased for fiscal 2014 compared to prior year, reflecting increased net sales, lower inventory charges, sales of solar tools that were written down previously and continued cost reduction measures, proceeds from a favorable litigation outcome, and spending controls.
business combinations tokyo electron limited on september 24, 2013, applied and tel entered into a business combination agreement, which was intended to effect a strategic combination of their respective businesses into a new combined company, and was subject to regulatory approvals. on april 26, 2015, applied and tel announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate the business combination agreement. no termination fee was payable by either applied or tel.

financial condition, liquidity and capital resources applied's cash, cash equivalents and investments increased to $5.9 billion at october 25, 2015 from $4.1 billion at october 26, 2014.
cash, cash equivalents and investments consisted of the following:
sources and uses of cash a summary of cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities was as follows:
cash provided by operating activities                $1,163           $1,800                 $623
operating activities cash from operating activities for fiscal 2015 was $1.2 billion, which reflects net income adjusted for the effect of non-cash charges and changes in working capital components. non-cash charges included depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation, restructuring and asset impairments and deferred income taxes. the primary drivers of the decrease in cash from operating activities from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 were the increases in inventories and deferred income taxes and decreases in accounts payable, accrued expenses, customer deposits, deferred revenue and income taxes payable, partially offset by higher net income. the increase in cash from operating activities from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to higher business volume and improved working capital performance.
applied did not utilize programs to discount letters of credit issued by customers in fiscal 2015 and 2013. applied discounted $29 million of letters of credit issued by customers in fiscal 2014. discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements. applied did not factor accounts receivable nor discounted promissory notes in fiscal 2015 and 2013. applied factored accounts receivable and discounted promissory notes of $45 million in fiscal 2014.
applied's working capital was $5.5 billion at october 25, 2015 and $4.1 billion at october 26, 2014.
days sales, inventory and payable outstanding at the end of each of the periods indicated were:
days sales outstanding varies due to the timing of shipments and the payment terms. days sales outstanding remained flat at the end of fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. the decrease for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to an increase in revenue and better linearity. days inventory outstanding increased at the end of fiscal 2015 reflecting higher inventory near the end of the period due to increase in deferred inventory and more builds as compared to revenue turns. days inventory outstanding remained flat in fiscal 2014 and 2013. days payable outstanding remained relatively flat in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013.
investing activities applied used $281 million of cash in investing activities in fiscal 2015 and $161 million in fiscal 2014. applied generated $215 million in cash from investing activities in fiscal 2013. capital expenditures in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $215 million, $241 million and $197 million, respectively. capital expenditures in fiscal 2015 were primarily for demonstration and test equipment and laboratory tools in north america. capital expenditures in fiscal 2014 were primarily for demonstration and test equipment and infrastructure improvements in north america, including creation of a new pilot operation facility and distribution center. capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 were primarily for demonstration and test equipment as well as laboratory tools and equipment upgrades in north america. purchases of investments, net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments was $62 million for fiscal 2015 and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases of investments totaled $67 million and $406 million in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. investing activities also included investments in technology to allow applied to access new market opportunities or emerging technologies.
applied's investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade money market mutual funds, u.s. treasury and agency securities, municipal bonds, corporate bonds and mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, as well as equity securities. applied regularly monitors the credit risk in its investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures, which may include the sale of certain securities, to manage such risks prudently in accordance with its investment policies.
financing activities applied generated $913 million of cash from financing activities in fiscal 2015, consisting primarily of net proceeds received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes of $1.8 billion and short-term borrowings by a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary of $800 million, offset by cash used for repurchases of its common stock of $1.3 billion and payment of cash dividends of $487 million. applied used cash in financing activities in fiscal 2014 and 2013 of $348 million and $519 million, respectively, which included payment of cash dividends to stockholders and issuances of common stock. applied made no repurchases of its common stock in fiscal 2014 and used cash to repurchase shares of its common stock in fiscal 2013 of $245 million. on april 26, 2015, applied's board of directors approved a common stock repurchase program authorizing up to $3.0 billion in repurchases over the three years ending april 2018. at october 25, 2015, $1.7 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this repurchase program. applied's prior stock repurchase program ended in march 2015. proceeds from stock issuances under equity compensation awards and related excess tax benefits in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $144 million, $137 million and $182 million, respectively.
during each of fiscal 2015 and 2014, applied's board of directors declared four quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share. during fiscal 2013, applied's board of directors declared three quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share and one quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share. cash paid in dividends during fiscal 2015, 2014 and fiscal 2013 amounted to $487 million, $485 million and $456 million, respectively. applied currently anticipates that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on applied's financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination by the board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of applied's stockholders.
applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to $1.6 billion. in september 2015, applied entered into a $1.5 billion committed revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is scheduled to expire in september 2020. this credit agreement provides for borrowings in united states dollars at interest rates keyed to one of various benchmark rates selected by applied for each advance, plus a margin based on applied's public debt rating, and includes financial and other covenants with which applied was in compliance at october 25, 2015. remaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately $67 million are with japanese banks. applied's ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request, and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks' prime reference rate denominated in japanese yen. no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities at both october 25, 2015 and october 26, 2014, and applied has not utilized these credit facilities.
in fiscal 2011, applied established a short-term commercial paper program of up to $1.5 billion. at october 25, 2015 and october 26, 2014, applied did not have any commercial paper outstanding, but may issue commercial paper notes under this program from time to time in the future.
in september 2015, applied issued senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1.8 billion. the indenture governing the notes includes certain covenants with which applied was in compliance at october 25, 2015. in november 2015, applied completed the redemption of the entire outstanding $400 million in principal amount of senior notes due in 2016. the redemption price was $405 million, and after adjusting for the carrying value of the debt issuance costs and discounts, applied recorded a $5 million loss on the prepayment of the $400 million debt, which will be included in non-operating loss in the consolidated statement of operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of long-term debt. in october 2015, a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary of applied entered into a short-term loan agreement, guaranteed by applied, under which it borrowed $800 million to facilitate the return of capital to applied.
others during fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, applied did not record any additional bad debt provision but released $9 million, $16 million and $13 million, respectively, of its allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of an overall lower risk profile of applied's customers. while applied believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts at october 25, 2015 is adequate, it will continue to closely monitor customer liquidity and economic conditions.
as of october 25, 2015, approximately $2.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries may be subject to u.s. taxes if repatriated for u.s. operations. of this amount, applied intends to indefinitely reinvest approximately $2.3 billion of these funds outside of the u.s. and does not plan to repatriate these funds. for the remaining cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries, u.s. taxes have been provided for in the financial statements.
although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above, applied's management believes that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to satisfy applied's liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. for further details regarding applied's operating, investing and financing activities, see the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report.
for details on standby letters of credit and other agreements with banks, see off-balance sheet arrangements below.
off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either applied or its subsidiaries. as of october 25, 2015, the maximum potential amount of future payments that applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately $58 million. applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. applied does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee agreements.
applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft arrangements, issuance of bank guarantees, and letters of credit. as of october 25, 2015, applied materials inc. has provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately $100 million to cover these arrangements.
applied also has operating leases for various facilities. total rent expense for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $32 million, $37 million and $36 million, respectively.

1   represents applied's agreements to purchase goods and services consisting of applied's outstanding purchase orders for goods and services.
2   other long-term liabilities in the table do not include pension, post-retirement and deferred compensation plans due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments. applied evaluates the need to make contributions to its pension and post-retirement benefit plans after considering the funded status of the plans, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. payments to the plans would be dependent on these factors and could vary across a wide range of amounts and time periods. payments for deferred compensation plans are dependent on activity by participants, making the timing of payments uncertain. information on applied's pension, post-retirement benefit and deferred compensation plans is presented in note 13, employee benefit plans, of the consolidated financial statements.
3   other long-term liabilities in the table do not include noncurrent income taxes payable, noncurrent deferred income taxes payable and certain tax-related liabilities classified as other noncurrent liabilities on the balance sheet, due to the uncertainty in the timing and amount of future payments. as of october 25, 2015, the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits that was not expected to result in payment of cash within one year was $177 million. interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions that were not expected to result in payment of cash within one year of october 25, 2015 and october 26, 2014 were $14 million and $25 million, respectively.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies.
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied's consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied's financial condition or results of operations. specifically, these policies have the following attributes: (1) applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and (2) different estimates applied could reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on applied's financial condition or results of operations.
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. these estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as applied's operating environment changes. these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known. in addition, management is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time. these uncertainties include those discussed in part i, item 1a, "risk factors." based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that applied's consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, and provide a meaningful presentation of applied's financial condition and results of operations.
management believes that the following are critical accounting policies and estimates:
revenue recognition applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is probable. each sale arrangement may contain commercial terms that differ from other arrangements. in addition, applied frequently enters into contracts that contain multiple deliverables. judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units. moreover, judgment is used in interpreting the commercial terms and determining when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period. while changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the units of accounting will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement, any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on applied's financial condition and results of operations.
warranty costs applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized. estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product, current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs. applied's warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates, material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period. as applied's customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally, labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs. the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs. unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs. if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied's estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
allowance for doubtful accounts applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. this allowance is based on historical experience, credit evaluations, specific customer collection history and any customer-specific issues applied has identified. changes in circumstances, such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer's ability to meet its financial obligation to applied or its payment trends, may require applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to applied, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
inventory valuation inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand. applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand. in addition, inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products. if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated, additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
goodwill and intangible assets applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable, and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment. intangible assets, such as purchased technology, are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition. the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value.
to test goodwill for impairment, applied first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. if it is concluded that this is the case, applied then performs the two-step goodwill impairment test. otherwise, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. under the two-step goodwill impairment test, applied would in the first step compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, applied would then perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. if applied determines that the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, applied would record an impairment charge equal to the difference.
applied determines the fair value of each reporting unit based on a weighting of an income and a market approach. applied bases the fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. under the income approach, applied estimates the fair value based on discounted cash flow method.
the estimates used in the impairment testing are consistent with the discrete forecasts that applied uses to manage its business, and considers any significant developments during the period. under the discounted cash flow method, cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts are estimated using a terminal growth rate, which considers the long-term earnings growth rate specific to the reporting units. the estimated future cash flows are discounted to present value using each reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital. the weighted average cost of capital measures a reporting unit's cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and equity in a reporting unit's target capital structure. in addition, the weighted average cost of capital is derived using both known and estimated market metrics, and is adjusted to reflect both the timing and risks associated with the estimated cash flows. the tax rate used in the discounted cash flow method is the median tax rate of comparable companies and reflects applied's current international structure, which is consistent with the market participant perspective. under the market approach, applied uses the guideline company method which applies market multiples to forecasted revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. applied uses market multiples that are consistent with comparable publicly-traded companies and considers each reporting unit's size, growth and profitability relative to its comparable companies.
management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment, especially in emerging markets. indicators of potential impairment include, but are not limited to, challenging economic conditions, an unfavorable industry or economic environment or other severe decline in market conditions. such conditions could have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates used for the fair value calculation, resulting in an unexpected goodwill impairment charge, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations. see note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of goodwill impairment.
income taxes applied's effective tax rate is affected by the geographical composition of income and income tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions.
applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities, net operating losses and tax credit carryovers. deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. management has determined that it is more likely than not that applied's future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets, net of existing valuation allowance.
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied's expectations could have a material impact on applied's results of operations and financial condition.
non-gaap adjusted results management uses non-gaap adjusted results to evaluate operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes. applied believes these measures enhance investors' ability to review the company's business from the same perspective as management and facilitate comparisons of this period's results with prior periods. the non-gaap adjusted results presented below exclude the impact of the following, where applicable: certain items related to acquisitions; restructuring charges and any associated adjustments; impairments of assets, goodwill, or investments; gain or loss on sale of strategic investments or facilities; and certain discrete adjustments and tax items. these non-gaap adjusted measures are not in accordance with gaap and may differ from non-gaap methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. the presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap.

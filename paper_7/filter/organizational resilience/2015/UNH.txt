executive overview general unitedhealth group is a diversified health and well-being company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and making the health system work better for everyone. through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data; information and intelligence; and clinical care management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system. we offer a broad spectrum of products and services through two distinct platforms: unitedhealthcare, which provides health care coverage and benefits services; and optum, which provides information and technology-enabled health services.
we have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, unitedhealthcare and optum:
•   unitedhealthcare, which includes unitedhealthcare employer &amp; individual, unitedhealthcare medicare &amp; retirement, unitedhealthcare community &amp; state and unitedhealthcare global;
•   optumhealth;
further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in part i, item 1, "business" and in note 14 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8, "financial statements."
business trends our businesses participate in the united states, brazilian and certain other international health economies. in the united states, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises approximately 18% of gross domestic product. we expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. the rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and regulatory changes, which have impacted and could further impact our results of operations.
pricing trends. to price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs. we frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations. our review of regulatory considerations involves a focus on minimum mlr thresholds and the risk adjustment and reinsurance provisions that impact the small group and individual markets. we will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions.
the commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group markets. we expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes. health reform legislation included an annual, nondeductible insurance industry tax (health insurance industry tax) to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based health insurance products. health reform legislation also included three programs designed to stabilize health insurance markets (premium stabilization programs): a permanent risk adjustment program; a temporary risk corridors program; and a transitional reinsurance program (reinsurance program). health plans have generally reflected the health insurance industry tax and reinsurance program (together, aca fees) in their pricing. conversely, the industry has continued to experience favorable medical cost trends due to moderated utilization, which has impacted pricing trends. in 2015, health plans' pricing returned to a more normal year-over-year inflation after pricing for higher costs due to aca fees in 2014. as always, the intensity of pricing competition depends on local market conditions and competitive dynamics. a provision in the 2016 federal budget imposes a one year moratorium for 2017 on the collection of the health insurance industry tax. this will impact our pricing for contracts that renew during 2016 but cover all or portions of 2017.
medicare advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in "regulatory trends and uncertainties."
we expect continued medicaid revenue growth due to anticipated increases in the number of people we serve; we also believe that the reimbursement rate environment creates the risk of downward pressure on medicaid net margin percentages. we continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. we advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs.
medical cost trends. our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. consistent with our experience in recent years, our 2015 cost trends were largely driven by unit cost pressures from health care providers. in 2016, we expect continued unit cost pressure and a modest increase in utilization. we endeavor to mitigate those increases with medical management. our 2016 management activities include managing costs across all health care categories, including specialty pharmacy spending, as new therapies are introduced at high costs and older drugs have unexpected price increases.
delivery system and payment modernization. the health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. we continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in plans with underlying incentive-based care provider reimbursement models that reward high-quality, affordable care and foster collaboration. we work together with clinicians to leverage our data and analytics to provide the necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes for patients.
we are increasingly rewarding care providers for delivering improvements in quality and cost-efficiency. as of december 31, 2015, we served more than 14 million people through some form of aligned contractual arrangement, including full-risk, shared-risk and bundled episode-of-care and performance incentive payment approaches. as of december 31, 2015, our contracts with value-based spending total nearly $46 billion annually, up from $13 billion in 2011.
this trend is creating needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our optum business platform.
regulatory trends and uncertainties following is a summary of management's view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of health reform legislation and other regulatory items. for additional information regarding health reform legislation and regulatory trends and uncertainties, see part i, item 1 "business - government regulation" and item 1a, "risk factors."
medicare advantage rates and minimum loss ratios. medicare advantage rates have been cut over the last several years, with additional funding reductions to be phased-in through 2017. the final 2016 medicare advantage rates were more stable than in recent years, with an expected average increase in industry funding of approximately 1.25%. however, these rates still trail the typical industry forward medical cost trend of 3% which creates continued pressure in the medicare advantage program. the impact of these cuts to our medicare advantage revenues is partially mitigated by reductions in provider reimbursements for those care providers with rates indexed to medicare advantage revenues or medicare fee-for-service reimbursement rates. these factors affected our plan benefit designs, market participation, growth prospects and earnings expectations for our medicare advantage plans for 2016.
the ongoing reductions to medicare advantage funding place continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency. there are a number of adjustments we have made to partially offset these rate reductions. these adjustments will impact the majority of the seniors we serve through medicare advantage. for example, we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust members' benefits, implement or increase the member premiums that supplement the monthly payments we receive from the government and decide on a county-by-county basis where we will offer medicare advantage plans.
in the longer term, we also may be able to mitigate some of the effects of reduced funding by increasing enrollment due, in part, to the increasing number of people eligible for medicare in coming years. as medicare advantage reimbursement changes, other products may become relatively more attractive to medicare beneficiaries and increase the demand for other senior health benefits products such as our market-leading medicare supplement and stand-alone medicare part d insurance offerings.
our medicare advantage rates are currently enhanced by cms quality bonuses in certain counties based on our local plans' star ratings. the level of star ratings from cms, based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards, will impact future quality bonuses. in addition, star ratings affect the amount of savings a plan can use to offer supplemental benefits, which ultimately may affect the plan's membership and revenue. beginning in 2015, quality bonus payments were paid only to plans rated 4 stars and higher. we expect that approximately 56% of our medicare advantage members will be in plans rated four stars or higher for payment year 2016 compared with approximately 39% of members in plans rated four stars or higher for payment year 2015. we further expect that at least 63% of our medicare advantage members will be in plans rated four stars or higher for payment year 2017. we continue to dedicate substantial resources to advance our quality scores and star ratings to strengthen our local market programs and further improve our performance.
health insurance industry tax and premium stabilization programs. the industry-wide amount of the health insurance industry tax was $11.3 billion in 2015 and will remain at that level in 2016. a provision in the 2016 federal budget imposes a one year moratorium for 2017, on the collection of the health insurance industry tax. the health insurance industry tax will again be imposed for 2018 and beyond. in 2016, we expect that our share of the health insurance industry tax will increase to $1.9 billion from $1.8 billion in 2015 due to growth in our business.
the reinsurance program is a temporary program that will be funded on a per capita basis from all commercial lines of business, including insured and self-funded arrangements. the total three year amount of $25 billion for the reinsurance program is allocated as follows: $20 billion (2014 - $10 billion, 2015 - $6 billion, 2016 - $4 billion) subject to increases based on state decisions, to fund the reinsurance pool and $5 billion (2014 and 2015 - $2 billion, 2016 - $1 billion) to fund the u.s. treasury. the actual 2014 reinsurance program contributions totaled approximately $9.7 billion, which was $2.3 billion short of the expected amount; all was used to fund the reinsurance program. while funding for the reinsurance program will come from all commercial lines of business, only market reform compliant individual businesses will be eligible for reinsurance recoveries. we have not recorded any receivables under the temporary risk corridor program for 2014 or 2015 due to uncertainty over the level of government funding for this program and the ultimate collectability of these funds.
for detail on the health insurance industry tax and premium stabilization programs, see note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8, "financial statements."
individual public exchanges. after a measured approach to the individual public exchange market in 2014 in which we participated in only four states, we expanded significantly in 2015 to participate in 23 states. in 2016, we are expanding our individual public exchange offerings by 11 states to a total of 34 states. recent data, however, has caused us to reconsider our long-term position in the individual public exchange market. we have seen lower consumer participation than we and others expected, lower government expectations for future consumer participation, declining performance in and accelerating failures of government-sponsored cooperatives and worsening of our own claims experience. we have recorded a premium deficiency reserve for a portion of our estimated 2016 losses in our 2015 results for in-force contracts as of january 1, 2016. we are not pursuing membership growth and have taken a comprehensive set of actions (e.g., increased prices and eliminated marketing and commissions) to contain membership growth. by mid-2016 we will determine to what extent, if any, we will continue to offer products in the individual public exchange market in 2017.

selected operating performance and other significant items the following represents a summary of select 2015 year-over-year operating comparisons to 2014 and other 2015 significant items.
•   consolidated revenues increased by 20%, optum revenues grew 42% and unitedhealthcare revenues increased 10%.
•   unitedhealthcare grew to serve an additional 1.7 million people domestically. each optum business grew revenues by 19% or more.
•   earnings from operations increased by 7%, including an increase of 30% at optum partially offset by a decrease of 3% at unitedhealthcare.
•   cash flow from operations were $9.7 billion an increase of 21%.
•   on july 23, 2015, we acquired catamaran through the purchase of all of its outstanding common stock for cash. see note 3 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 "financial statements" for more information.
2015 results of operations compared to 2014 results our results of operations during the year ended december 31, 2015 were affected by our acquisition of catamaran on july 23, 2015.
consolidated financial results revenues the increase in revenues was primarily driven by the effect of the catamaran acquisition and organic growth in the number of individuals served across our benefits businesses and across all of optum's businesses.
medical costs medical costs increased primarily due to risk-based membership growth in our benefits businesses. medical costs also included losses on individual exchange-compliant products related to 2015, and the establishment of premium deficiency reserves related to the 2016 policy year for anticipated future losses for in-force individual exchange-compliant contracts and a new state medicaid contract.
operating cost ratio the decrease in our operating cost ratio was due to the inclusion of catamaran and growth in government benefits programs, both of which have lower operating cost ratios and company wide productivity gains.

the increase in commercial risk-based enrollment was the result of strong participation in unitedhealthcare's individual public exchange products and favorable annual renewal activity and new business wins in the employer group segment. medicare advantage participation increased year-over-year primarily due to growth in people served through employer-sponsored group medicare advantage plans. medicaid growth was driven by the combination of health reform related medicaid expansion, states launching new programs to complement established programs and growth in established programs, partially offset by a decrease of 175,000 people in one market where an additional offering was introduced by the state in the first quarter of 2015. medicare supplement growth reflected strong customer retention and new sales. the number of people served internationally decreased year-over-year primarily due to pricing and underwriting disciplines in brazil in response to regulatory actions and declining employment levels in brazil.
unitedhealthcare's revenue growth during the year ended december 31, 2015 was due to growth in the number of individuals served across its businesses and price increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends.
unitedhealthcare's operating earnings for the year ended december 31, 2015 decreased as the combined individual exchange-compliant losses and premium deficiency reserves totaling $815 million more than offset strong growth across the business, improved medical cost management and increased productivity.
optum total revenues and operating earnings increased for the year ended december 31, 2015 as each reporting segment increased revenues and earnings from operations by double-digit percentages as a result of the factors discussed below.
optumhealth revenue and earnings from operations increased at optumhealth during the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily due to growth in its care delivery businesses and the impact of acquisitions in patient care centers and population health management services. the operating margins for the year ended december 31, 2015 decreased from the prior year primarily due to investments made to develop future growth opportunities.
optuminsight revenue, earnings from operations and operating margins at optuminsight for the year ended december 31, 2015 increased primarily due to expansion and growth in care provider revenue management services and payer services.
optumrx revenue and earnings from operations for the year ended december 31, 2015 increased due to the mid-year acquisition of catamaran as well as strong organic growth. operating margins for the year ended december 31, 2015 decreased slightly due to the inclusion of lower margin catamaran business. for more information about catamaran, see note 3 in notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 "financial statements."
2014 results of operations compared to 2013 results consolidated financial results revenues the increases in revenues during the year ended december 31, 2014 were primarily driven by growth in the number of individuals served in our public and senior markets businesses and growth across all of optum's businesses.
medical costs and medical care ratio medical costs during the year ended december 31, 2014 increased due to risk-based membership growth in our public and senior markets businesses. to the extent possible, we included the reform fees and related tax impacts in our pricing; since the aca fees are included in operating costs, this decreased our medical care ratio in 2014. this decrease from aca fees was partially offset by the impact of lower levels of favorable medical cost reserve development.
operating cost ratio the increase in our operating cost ratio during the year ended december 31, 2014 was due to the introduction of aca fees and services business growth and acquisitions, partially offset by productivity and operating performance gains.
income tax rate the increase in our income tax rate resulted primarily from the nondeductible health insurance industry tax.
reportable segments unitedhealthcare unitedhealthcare's revenue growth during the year ended december 31, 2014 was due to growth in the number of individuals served in our public and senior markets businesses; revenues to recover aca fees, which resulted in $1.5 billion of additional annual premiums in 2014; and commercial price increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends. these increases were partially offset by decreased commercial risk-based enrollment and a reduced level of medicare advantage funding.
unitedhealthcare's operating earnings for the year ended december 31, 2014 were pressured year-over-year by aca fees, medicare advantage funding reductions, increased spending on specialty medications to treat hepatitis c and reduced levels of favorable medical cost reserve development. partially offsetting these factors were growth in our public and senior markets businesses, reduced levels of per-member inpatient hospital utilization and revenue true-ups.
optum total revenues increased for the year ended december 31, 2014 primarily due to pharmacy growth at optumrx and growth at optumhealth.
the increases in optum's earnings from operations and operating margins for the year ended december 31, 2014 were driven by revenue growth and increased productivity, partially offset by investments at optumhealth and optuminsight.
optumhealth revenue increased at optumhealth during 2014 primarily due to acquisitions and growth in care delivery and subacute care services.
earnings from operations and operating margins for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased primarily due to revenue growth and cost efficiencies, offset in part by investments to develop future growth opportunities.
optuminsight revenue, earnings from operations and operating margins at optuminsight for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased primarily due to the growth and expansion in revenue management services and government exchange services, partially offset by a reduction in hospital compliance services and investments for future growth.
optumrx increased optumrx revenue for the year ended december 31, 2014 was due to growth in people served in unitedhealthcare's public and senior markets, the insourcing of unitedhealthcare's commercial pharmacy benefit programs, growth from external clients and an increase in specialty pharmaceutical revenues.
earnings from operations and operating margins for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased primarily due to growth in scale that resulted in greater productivity and better absorption of our fixed costs and improved performance in both drug purchasing and home delivery pharmacy fulfillment.
liquidity, financial condition and capital resources liquidity introduction we manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. we continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses.
our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. these standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies.
in 2015, our u.s. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.4 billion. for the year ended december 31, 2014, our u.s. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.6 billion. see note 11 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8, "financial statements" for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends.
our nonregulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations that are available for general corporate use. cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. we use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to our stockholders through shareholder dividends and/or repurchases of our common stock, depending on market conditions.

2015 cash flows compared to 2014 cash flows cash flows provided by operating activities in 2015 increased primarily due to growth in risk-based products, which increased medical costs payable and an increase in cms risk share payables, which increased other policy liabilities. these increases were partially offset by an increase in pharmacy rebates, which increased other receivables, the increase in the payment of the 2015 health insurance industry tax and the payment of reinsurance program fees in 2015.
other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included increased cash paid for acquisitions and net debt issuances and decreased share repurchases, all due to the catamaran acquisition.
2014 cash flows compared to 2013 cash flows cash flows provided by operating activities in 2014 increased primarily due to an increased level of accounts payable and other liabilities, including the collection of reinsurance program fees in advance of remittance in 2015, partially offset by an increase in government receivables.
other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included: (a) a change in investment activity from net purchases in 2013 to net sales in 2014; (b) an increase in part d subsidy receivables causing a change in customer funds administered; and (c) increased levels of cash used to repurchase common stock.
financial condition as of december 31, 2015, our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investment balances of $31.2 billion included $10.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $286 million was available for general corporate use), $18.6 billion of debt securities and $1.6 billion of investments in equity securities consisting of investments in non-u.s. dollar fixed-income funds; employee savings plan related investments; venture capital funds; and dividend paying stocks. given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. see note 5 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8, "financial statements" for further detail concerning our fair value measurements.
our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.4 years and a weighted-average credit rating of "aa" as of december 31, 2015. when multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.
capital resources and uses of liquidity in addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows:
commercial paper and bank credit facilities. our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. for more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see note 9 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8, "financial statements."
our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-stockholders' equity ratio of not more than 55%. as of december 31, 2015, our debt to debt-plus-stockholders' equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities was approximately 47%.
long-term debt. periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, for example, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. in july 2015, we issued debt to fund the acquisition of catamaran. for more information on this debt issuance, see note 9 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 "financial statements."
credit ratings. our credit ratings as of december 31, 2015 were as follows:
moody's                   standard &amp; poor's          fitch                    a.m. best ratings        outlook    ratings             outlook    ratings       outlook    ratings         outlook senior unsecured debt   a3             negative   a+                  negative   a-            negative   bbb+            stable commercial paper        p-2            n/a        a-1                 n/a        f1            n/a        amb-2           n/a the availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. for example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital.
share repurchase program. we expect continued moderated share repurchase activity through 2016 following the acquisition of catamaran. for more information on our share repurchase program, see note 11 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8, "financial statements."
dividends. in june 2015, our board increased our quarterly cash dividend to stockholders to an annual dividend rate of $2.00 per share. for more information on our dividend, see note 11 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8, "financial statements."
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of december 31, 2015, under our various contractual obligations and commitments:

(a)   includes interest coupon payments and maturities at par or put values. the table also assumes amounts are outstanding through their contractual term. see note 9 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8, "financial statements" for more detail.
(b)   includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements that are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty. excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2015.
(c)   future policy benefits represent account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders, excluding surrender charges, for universal life and investment annuity products and for long-duration health policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay benefits to be incurred in future years. see note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8, "financial statements" for more detail.
(d)   as the timing of future settlements is uncertain, the long-term portion has been classified as "thereafter."
(e)   includes obligations associated with contingent consideration and other payments related to business acquisitions, certain employee benefit programs and various other long-term liabilities. due to uncertainty regarding payment timing, obligations for employee benefit programs, charitable contributions and other liabilities have been classified as "thereafter."
(f)   includes remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments.
(g)   includes commitments for redeemable shares of our subsidiaries.
we do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources. however, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2015, we were not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements, which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
recently issued accounting standards see note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 "financial statements" for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us.
critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions.
medical costs payable each reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. we develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. the actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim processing backlogs, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service. as of december 31, 2015, our days outstanding in medical payables was 50 days, calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times 365 days.
each period, we re-examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. as more complete claim information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. therefore, in every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). medical costs in 2015, 2014 and 2013 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $320 million, $420 million and $680 million, respectively.
in developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. for example, we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36-month period. a completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. for months prior to the most recent three months, we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. for the most recent three months, we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (pmpm) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors.
completion factors. completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs as well as other factors. if actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserves may be significantly impacted.
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of december 31, 2015:
completion factors(decrease) increase in factors            increase (decrease)in medical costs payable medical cost pmpm trend factors. medical cost pmpm trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months. medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators, including but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the national centers for disease control. we also consider macroeconomic variables such as gross-domestic product growth, employment and disposable income. a large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates, including: our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, catastrophes and epidemics.
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of december 31, 2015:
medical cost pmpm trendincrease (decrease) in factors            increase (decrease)in medical costs payable the completion factors and medical costs pmpm trend factors analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims.
our estimate of medical costs payable represents management's best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of december 31, 2015, developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of december 31, 2015; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our december 31, 2015 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding aarp medicare supplement insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2015 net earnings would have increased or decreased by $83 million.
revenues we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from health care insurance premiums. we recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services.
our medicare advantage and medicare part d premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under the cms risk adjustment payment methodology. the cms risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. we and health care providers collect, capture and submit available diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines. cms uses submitted diagnosis codes, demographic information and special statuses to determine the risk score for most medicare advantage beneficiaries. cms also retroactively adjusts risk scores during the year based on additional data. we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms. as a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations, the actual amount of cms' retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates. this may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our medicare premium revenue and, accordingly, our profitability. risk adjustment data for certain of our plans is subject to review by the federal and state governments, including audit by regulators. see note 13 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8, "financial statements" for additional information regarding these audits. our estimates of premiums to be recognized are reduced by any expected premium minimum mlr rebates payable by us to cms.
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill. goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. we completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill as of october 1, 2015. all of our reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values. during 2015, we changed our annual quantitative goodwill impairment testing date from january 1 to october 1 of each year. the change in the goodwill impairment test date better aligns the impairment testing procedures with the timing of our long-term planning process, which is a significant input to the testing. this change in testing date did not delay, accelerate, or avoid a goodwill impairment charge. impairment tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount.
to determine whether goodwill is impaired, we perform a multi-step test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. if the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired.
we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows, which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods and discount rates. for each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test.
forecasts and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. key assumptions used in these forecasts include:
•   revenue trends. key revenue drivers for each reporting unit are determined and assessed. significant factors include: membership growth, medical trends and the impact and expectations of regulatory environments. additional macro-economic assumptions relating to unemployment, gdp growth, interest rates and inflation are also evaluated and incorporated, as appropriate.
•   medical cost trends. for further discussion of medical cost trends, see the "medical cost trend" section of executive overview-business trends above and the discussion in the "medical costs payable" critical accounting estimate above. similar factors, including historical and expected medical cost trend levels, are considered in estimating our long-term medical trends at the reporting unit level.
•   operating productivity. we forecast expected operating cost levels based on historical levels and expectations of future operating cost levels.
•   capital levels. the operating and long-term capital requirements for each business are considered.
discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unit-specific factors. we have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty.
the passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units' operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future.
intangible assets. our recorded separately-identifiable intangible assets were acquired in business combinations and were initially recorded at their fair values. finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives, while indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis.
our finite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an asset's (or asset group's) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators, including: changes in the use of the assets, changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value, experienced or expected operating cash-flow deterioration or losses, adverse changes in customer populations, adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value and other factors.
our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. to determine if an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we compare its estimated fair value to its carrying value. if the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. intangible assets were not impaired in 2015.
investments our investments are principally classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. we continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments.
other-than-temporary impairment assessment. individual securities with fair values lower than costs are reviewed for impairment considering the following factors: our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the length of time and extent of impairment and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer. other factors included in the assessment include the type and nature of the securities and their liquidity. given the nature of our portfolio, primarily investment grade securities, historical impairments were largely market related (e.g., interest rate fluctuations) as opposed to credit related. in december 2015, the federal reserve (fed) announced that it would increase short-
term interest rates to a range between 25 and 50 basis points. fed officials emphasized that they intend to raise rates gradually, if necessary. we estimate a 25 basis point rise in short-term interest rates impacts the fair-value of our investments by $200 million. our large cash holdings reduce the risk that we will be required to sell a security. however, our intent to sell a security may change from period to period if facts and circumstances change.
the judgments and estimates related to other-than-temporary impairment may ultimately prove to be inaccurate due to many factors, including: circumstances may change over time, industry sector and market factors may differ from expectations and estimates or we may ultimately sell a security we previously intended to hold. our assessment of the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer may ultimately prove to be inaccurate as time passes and new information becomes available, including changes to current facts and circumstances, or as unknown or estimated unlikely trends develop.
legal matters a description of our legal proceedings is presented in note 13 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8, "financial statements."
concentrations of credit risk investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our board of directors. this policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to u.s. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base. as of december 31, 2015, we had a reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our golden rule financial corporation life and annuity business in 2005. see note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8, "financial statements." for more information. as of december 31, 2015, there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the objectives of our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") are to provide users of our consolidated financial statements with the following:
•   a narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results;
•   context to the financial statements; and
•   information that allows assessment of the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance.
our md&a is provided as a supplement to, and should be read together with, our audited consolidated financial statements for the three years ended december 31, 2017 included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k. except as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout our md&a are those of t-mobile us, inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
business overview change in accounting principle effective january 1, 2017, the imputed discount on eip receivables, which is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and was previously recognized within interest income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income, is recognized within other revenues in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. we believe this presentation is preferable because it provides a better representation of amounts earned from the company's major ongoing operations and aligns with industry practice thereby enhancing comparability. we have applied this change retrospectively and the effect of this change for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, was a reclassification of $248 million and $414 million, respectively, from interest income to other revenues. the amortization of imputed discount on our eip receivables for the year ended december 31, 2017 was $280 million. for additional information, see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
un-carrier strategy the un-carrier is about adding value to the customer relationship by changing the rules of the industry and giving our customers more. we introduced our un-carrier strategy in 2013 with the objective of eliminating customer pain points from the unnecessary complexity of the wireless communication industry. since that time, we have continued our efforts with the launch of additional initiatives of our un-carrier strategy. during 2017, we launched the following un-carrier initiatives:
•   in january 2017, we introduced, un-carrier next, where monthly wireless service fees and sales taxes are included in the advertised monthly recurring charge for t-mobile one. we also unveiled kickback on t-mobile one, where participating customers who use 2 gb or less of data in a month, will get up to a $10 credit per qualifying line on their next month's bill. in addition, we introduced the un-contract for t-mobile one with the first-ever price guarantee on an unlimited 4g lte plan which allows current t-mobile one customers to keep their price for service until they decide to change it.
•   in september 2017, we introduced, un-carrier next: netflix on us, through an exclusive new partnership with netflix where qualifying t-mobile one customers on family plans can opt in for a standard monthly netflix service plan at no additional cost.
our ability to acquire and retain branded customers is important to our business in the generation of revenues and we believe our un-carrier strategy, along with ongoing network improvements, has been successful in attracting and retaining customers as evidenced by continued branded customer growth and improved branded postpaid phone and branded prepaid customer churn.

we believe current and future regulatory changes have made the lifeline program offered by our wholesale partners uneconomical. we will continue to support our wholesale partners offering the lifeline program, but have excluded the lifeline customers from our reported wholesale subscriber base resulting in the removal of 4,528,000 reported wholesale customers in 2017.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, a handset oem announced recalls on certain of its smartphone devices. as a result, in 2016 we recorded no revenue associated with the device sales to customers and impaired the devices to their net realizable value. the oem agreed to reimburse t-mobile for direct and indirect costs associated with the recall, as such, we recorded an amount due from the oem as an offset to the loss recorded in cost of equipment sales and the costs incurred within selling, general and administrative in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income and a reduction to accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. the reimbursement was received from the oem in 2017.
hurricane impacts during the third and fourth quarters of 2017, our operations in texas, florida and puerto rico experienced losses related to hurricanes. the impact to operating income for the year ended december 31, 2017, from lost revenue, assets damaged or destroyed and other hurricane related costs are included in the table below. we expect additional expenses to be incurred and customer activity to be impacted in the first quarter of 2018, primarily related to our operations in puerto rico. we have recognized insurance recoveries related to those hurricane losses in the amount of approximately $93 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 as an offset to the costs incurred within cost of services in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income and as an increase to other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. we continue to assess the damage of the hurricanes and work with our insurance carriers to submit claims for property damage and business interruption. we expect to record additional insurance recoveries related to these hurricanes in future periods.

results of operations highlights for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016
•   total revenues of $40.6 billion increased $3.1 billion, or 8%. the increase was primarily driven by growth in service and equipment revenues as further discussed below. on september 1, 2016, we sold our marketing and distribution rights to certain existing t-mobile co-branded customers to a current mvno partner for nominal consideration. the mvno transaction shifted branded postpaid revenues to wholesale revenues, but did not materially impact total revenues.
•   service revenues of $30.2 billion increased $2.3 billion, or 8%. the increase was primarily due to growth in our average branded customer base as a result of strong customer response to our un-carrier initiatives, promotions and the success of our metropcs brand.
•   equipment revenues of $9.4 billion increased $648 million, or 7%. the increase was primarily due to higher average revenue per device sold and an increase from customer purchases of leased devices at the end of the lease term, partially offset by lower lease revenues.
•   operating income of $4.9 billion increased $838 million, or 21%. the increase was primarily due to higher total service revenues and lower depreciation and amortization, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative, lower gains on disposal of spectrum licenses and higher cost of services expenses.
•   net income of $4.5 billion increased $3.1 billion, or 211%. the increase was primarily due to the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the "tcja"), which resulted in a net tax benefit of $2.2 billion in 2017, and higher operating income driven by the factors described above, partially offset by the negative impact from hurricanes. net income included net, after-tax spectrum gains of $174 million and $509 million, for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
•   adjusted ebitda, a non-gaap financial measure, of $11.2 billion increased $574 million, or 5%. the increase was primarily due to higher operating income driven by the factors described above, partially offset by lower gains on disposal of spectrum licenses. adjusted ebitda included pre-tax spectrum gains of $235 million and $835 million for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
•   net cash provided by operating activities of $8.0 billion increased $1.8 billion, or 30%. see "liquidity and capital resources" section for additional information.
•   free cash flow, a non-gaap financial measure, of $2.7 billion increased $1.3 billion, or 90%. see "liquidity and capital resources" section for additional information.

total revenues increased $3.1 billion, or 8%, primarily due to higher revenues from branded postpaid and prepaid customers as well as higher equipment revenues as discussed below.
•   a 7% increase in average branded postpaid phone customers, primarily from growth in our customer base driven by the continued strong customer response to our un-carrier initiatives and promotions for services and devices, including the growing success of our business channel, t-mobile for business; and
•   the positive impact from a decrease in the non-cash net revenue deferral for data stash; partially offset by
•   the negative impact from hurricanes of approximately $37 million.
•   a 7% increase in average branded prepaid customers primarily driven by growth in the customer base; and
•   a 2% increase in branded prepaid arpu from the success of our metropcs brand and the optimization of our third-party distribution channels; partially offset by
•   the negative impact from hurricanes of approximately $11 million.
wholesale revenues increased $199 million, or 22%, primarily from the impact of the mvno transaction, growth in mvno customers and higher minimum commitment revenues.
roaming and other service revenues decreased $20 million, or 8%.
•   an increase of $445 million in device sales revenues excluding purchased lease devices, primarily due to:
•   higher average revenue per device sold due to an increase in the high-end device mix and the impacts of an oem recall of its smartphone devices in 2016, partially offset by an increase in promotions and device-related commissions spending; partially offset by
•   a 2% decrease in the number of devices sold, excluding purchased lease devices, driven by a lower branded postpaid handset upgrade rate. device sales revenue is recognized at the time of sale;
•   an increase of $395 million from customers' purchase of leased devices at the end of the lease term;
•   an increase of $231 million primarily related to proceeds from liquidation of returned customer handsets in 2017; and
•   an increase of $130 million in sim and upgrade revenue; partially offset by
•   a decrease of $539 million in lease revenues from declining jump! on demand population due to shifting focus to our eip financing option beginning in the first quarter of 2016;
•   a decrease of $18 million in accessory revenue primarily related to the decrease in device sales volume; and
•   the negative impact from hurricanes of approximately $8 million.
under our jump! on demand program, upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers must return or purchase their device. revenue for purchased leased devices is recorded as equipment revenues when revenue recognition criteria have been met.
gross eip device financing to our customers increased by $437 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, primarily due to growth in the gross amount of equipment financed on eip. the increase was also due to certain customers on leased devices reaching the end of lease term who financed their devices over a nine-month eip.
our operating expenses consist of the following categories:
•   cost of services primarily includes costs directly attributable to providing wireless service through the operation of our network, including direct switch and cell site costs, such as rent, network access and transport costs, utilities, maintenance, associated labor costs, long distance costs, regulatory program costs, roaming fees paid to other carriers and data content costs.
•   cost of equipment sales primarily includes costs of devices and accessories sold to customers and dealers, device costs to fulfill insurance and warranty claims, costs related to returned and purchased leased devices, write-downs of inventory related to shrinkage and obsolescence, and shipping and handling costs.
•   selling, general and administrative primarily includes costs not directly attributable to providing wireless service for the operation of sales, customer care and corporate activities. these include commissions paid to dealers and retail employees for activations and upgrades, labor and facilities costs associated with retail sales force and administrative space, marketing and promotional costs, customer support and billing, bad debt expense, losses from sales of receivables and back office administrative support activities.
operating expenses increased $2.3 billion, or 7%, primarily from higher cost of services, cost of equipment sales, selling, general and administrative and lower gains on disposal of spectrum licenses, partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization as discussed below.
cost of services increased $369 million, or 6%, primarily from:
•   higher lease, engineering and employee-related expenses associated with network expansion; and
•   the negative impact from hurricanes of $105 million, net of insurance recoveries; partially offset by cost of equipment sales increased $789 million, or 7%, primarily from:
•   an increase of $806 million in device cost of equipment sales, excluding purchased leased devices, primarily due to:
•   a higher average cost per device sold primarily from an increase in the high-end device mix and from the impact of an oem recall of its smartphone devices in 2016; partially offset by
•   a 2% decrease in the number of devices sold, excluding purchased lease devices, driven by a lower branded postpaid handset upgrade rate.
•   an increase of $201 million in lease device cost of equipment sales, primarily due to:
•   an increase in lease buyouts as leases began reaching their term dates in 2017; partially offset by
•   a decrease in write downs to market value of devices returned to inventory resulting from a decrease in the number of leased device upgrades.
•   these increases are partially offset by a decrease of $159 million primarily related to:
•   higher proceeds from liquidation of returned customer handsets under our insurance programs; and
•   lower inventory adjustments related to physical adjustments and obsolete inventory; partially offset by
•   higher costs from an increase in the volume of liquidated returned customer handsets outside of our insurance programs.
•   a decrease of $57 million in accessory cost primarily driven by the decrease in device sales volume.
under our jump! on demand program, upon device upgrade or at the end of the lease term, customers must return or purchase their device. the cost of purchased leased devices is recorded as cost of equipment sales. returned devices transferred from property and equipment, net are recorded as inventory and are valued at the lower of cost or market with any write-down to market recognized as cost of equipment sales.
selling, general and administrative increased $881 million, or 8%, primarily from higher commissions, employee-related costs, promotional and advertising costs, and costs related to outsourced functions and managed services to support our growing customer base, partially offset by lower handset repair services cost. additionally, the negative impact from hurricanes of approximately $36 million contributed to the increase.
•   lower depreciation expense related to our jump! on demand program resulting from a lower number of devices under lease. under our jump! on demand program, the cost of a leased wireless device is depreciated to its estimated residual value over the period expected to provide utility to us; partially offset by
•   the continued build-out of our 4g lte network;
•   the implementation of the first component of our new billing system; and

cost of metropcs business combination decreased $104 million. on july 1, 2015, we officially completed the shutdown of the metropcs cdma network. network decommissioning costs primarily relate to the acceleration of lease costs for cell sites that would have otherwise been recognized as cost of services over the remaining lease term had we not decommissioned the cell sites. we do not expect to incur significant additional network decommissioning costs in 2018.
gains on disposal of spectrum licenses decreased $600 million, or 72%, primarily from gains of $636 million and $191 million on disposal of spectrum licenses with at&t and sprint during the first quarter and third quarter of 2016, respectively. these 2016 gains were partially offset by gains of $235 million from spectrum license transactions with at&t and verizon in 2017.
net income increased $3.1 billion, primarily due to the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 ("tcja") as discussed below, higher operating income and a net decrease in interest expense, partially offset by the negative impact from hurricanes of approximately $130 million, net of insurance recoveries.
•   operating income, the components of which are discussed above, increased $838 million, or 21%. the negative impact from the hurricanes for the year ended december 31, 2017 was approximately $201 million, net of insurance recoveries.
•   income tax benefit (expense) changed $2.2 billion, from an expense of $867 million in 2016 to a benefit of $1.4 billion in 2017 primarily from:
•   a lower effective tax rate. the effective tax rate was a benefit of 43.5% in 2017, compared to an expense of 37.3% in 2016. the decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the impact of the tcja, which resulted in a net tax benefit of $2.2 billion in 2017, substantially due to a re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities; and
•   a $319 million reduction in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in certain state jurisdictions in 2017; partially offset by the tcja was enacted december 22, 2017 and is generally effective beginning january 1, 2018. the tcja includes numerous changes to existing tax law, which have been reflected in the 2017 consolidated financial statements. the state corporate income tax impact of the tcja is complex and will continue to evolve as jurisdictions evaluate conformity to the numerous federal tax law changes. as such, a re-measurement of state deferred tax assets and liabilities and the associated net tax benefit or expense may result within the next 12 months. the tcja resulted in a net tax benefit of $2.2 billion in 2017.

gross eip device financing to our customers increased by $923 million to $6.1 billion primarily due to an increase in devices financed due to our focus on eip sales in 2016, compared to focus on devices financed on jump! on demand after the launch of the program at the end of the second quarter of 2015.
•   an increase in sales of certain eip receivables pursuant to our eip receivables sales arrangement resulting from an increase in the maximum funding commitment in june 2016. interest associated with eip receivables is imputed at the time of a device sale and then recognized over the financed installment term. see note 2 - receivables and allowance for credit losses of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information; and

•   synergies realized from the decommissioning of the metropcs cdma network.
cost of equipment sales increased $1.5 billion, or 16%, primarily from:
•   a 9% increase in the number of devices sold; and
•   an increase in the impact from returned and purchased leased devices.
under our jump! on demand program, the cost of the leased wireless device is capitalized and recognized as depreciation expense over the term of the lease rather than recognized as cost of equipment sales when the device is delivered to the customer. additionally, upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers must return or purchase their device. returned devices transferred from property and equipment, net are recorded as inventory and are valued at the lower of cost or market with any write-down to market recognized as cost of equipment sales.
selling, general and administrative increased $1.2 billion, or 12%, primarily from strategic investments to support our growing customer base including higher:
•   commissions driven by an increase in branded customer additions; and
•   $1.5 billion in depreciation expense related to devices leased under our jump! on demand program launched at the end of the second quarter of 2015. under our jump! on demand program, the cost of a leased wireless device is depreciated over the lease term to its estimated residual value. the total number of devices under lease was higher year-over-year, resulting in higher depreciation expense; and
•   the continued build-out of our 4g lte network.
cost of metropcs business combination decreased $272 million, or 72%, primarily from lower network decommissioning costs. in 2014, we began decommissioning the metropcs cdma network and certain other redundant network cell sites as part of the business combination. on july 1, 2015, we officially completed the shutdown of the metropcs cdma network. network decommissioning costs, which are excluded from adjusted ebitda, primarily relate to the acceleration of lease costs for cell sites that would have otherwise been recognized as cost of services over the remaining lease term had we not decommissioned the cell sites.

(2)   we believe current and future regulatory changes have made the lifeline program offered by our wholesale partners uneconomical. we will continue to support our wholesale partners offering the lifeline program, but have excluded the lifeline customers from our reported wholesale subscriber base resulting in the removal of 4,528,000 reported wholesale customers in 2017.
(3)   the mvno transaction resulted in a transfer of branded postpaid phone customers and branded prepaid customers to wholesale customers on september 1, 2016. prospectively from september 1, 2016, net customer additions for these customers are included within wholesale customers.
branded customers total branded customers increased 4,475,000, or 8%, in 2017 primarily from:
•   higher branded postpaid phone customers driven by the continued strong customer response to our un-carrier initiatives and promotional activities, the growing success of our business channel, t-mobile for business, continued growth in existing markets and distribution expansion to new greenfield markets, and lower churn, partially offset by increased competitive activity in the marketplace with all competitors having launched unlimited rate plans in the first quarter of 2017;
•   higher branded prepaid customers driven by the continued success of our metro pcs brand and continued growth from distribution expansion, partially offset by the optimization of our third-party distribution channels; and
•   higher branded postpaid other customers primarily due to higher connected devices and digits.
total branded customers increased 4,914,000, or 10%, in 2016 primarily from:

(2)   net customer activity for lifeline was excluded beginning in the second quarter of 2017 due to our determination based upon changes in the applicable government regulations that the lifeline program offered by our wholesale partners is uneconomical.
branded customers total branded net customer additions decreased 2,130,000, or 32%, in 2017 primarily from:
•   lower branded prepaid net customer additions primarily due to higher deactivations from a growing customer base, increased competitive activity in the marketplace and de-emphasis of the t-mobile prepaid brand. additional decreases resulted from the optimization of our third-party distribution channels; and
•   lower branded postpaid phone net customer additions primarily due to increased competitive activity in the marketplace partially offset by the continued strong customer response to our un-carrier initiatives and promotional activities, the growing success of our business channel, t-mobile for business, continued growth in new markets and distribution expansion to new greenfield markets, and lower churn; partially offset by
•   higher branded postpaid other net customer additions primarily due to higher gross customer additions from connected devices and digits, offset by higher deactivations from a growing customer base.
total branded net customer additions increased 780,000, or 13%, in 2016 primarily from:
•   higher branded prepaid net customer additions primarily due to the success of our metropcs brand, continued growth in new markets and distribution expansion, partially offset by an increase in the number of qualified branded prepaid customers migrating to branded postpaid plans; partially offset by
•   lower branded postpaid mobile broadband net customer additions primarily due to higher deactivations resulting from churn on a growing branded postpaid mobile broadband customer base, partially offset by higher gross customer
•   lower branded postpaid phone net customer additions primarily due to lower gross customer additions from higher deactivations on a growing customer base, partially offset by lower churn as well as an increase in the number of qualified branded prepaid customers migrating to branded postpaid plans as well as the optimization of our third-party distribution channels.
wholesale wholesale net customer additions decreased 385,000, or 25%, in 2017 primarily from lower gross customer additions, partially offset by lower deactivations driven by the removal of the lifeline program customers. while we continue to focus on more profitable wholesale opportunities, we believe current and future regulatory changes have made the lifeline program offered by our wholesale partners uneconomical. we will continue to support our wholesale partners offering the lifeline program, but have excluded the lifeline customers from our reported wholesale subscriber base resulting in the removal of 4,528,000 reported wholesale customers in 2017.
wholesale net customer additions decreased 871,000, or 36%, in 2016 primarily due to higher mvno deactivations from certain mvno partners.
customers per account customers per account is calculated by dividing the number of branded postpaid customers as of the end of the period by the number of branded postpaid accounts as of the end of the period. an account may include branded postpaid phone, mobile broadband, and digits customers. we believe branded postpaid customers per account provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate our branded postpaid customer base on a per account basis.

branded postpaid customers per account increased 2% in 2017 primarily from promotions targeting families.
branded postpaid customers per account increased 13% in 2016 primarily from growth of customers on family plan promotions and increased penetration of mobile broadband devices. in addition, the increase in 2016 was impacted by the mvno transaction.
churn churn represents the number of customers whose service was disconnected as a percentage of the average number of customers during the specified period. the number of customers whose service was disconnected is presented net of customers that subsequently have their service restored within a certain period of time. we believe that churn provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate customer retention and loyalty.

•   the mvno transaction as the customers transferred had a higher rate of churn; and
•   increased customer satisfaction and loyalty from ongoing improvements to network quality, customer service and the overall value of our offerings in the marketplace.
•   the mvno transaction as the customers transferred had a higher rate of churn; and
•   increased customer satisfaction and loyalty from ongoing improvements to network quality, customer service and the overall value of our offerings in the marketplace.
branded prepaid churn increased 16 basis points in 2017 primarily due to higher churn from increased competitive activity in the marketplace, partially offset by increased customer satisfaction and loyalty from ongoing improvements to network quality, customer service and overall value of our offerings in the marketplace.
•   a decrease in certain customers, which have a higher rate of branded prepaid churn;
•   strong performance of the metropcs brand; and
•   a methodology change in the third quarter of 2015 as discussed below.
during 2015, we had a methodology change that had no impact on our reported branded prepaid ending customers or net customer additions, but resulted in computationally lower gross customer additions and deactivations.
average revenue per user, average billings per user arpu represents the average monthly service revenue earned from customers. we believe arpu provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our service revenue realization per customer and assist in forecasting our future service revenues generated from our customer base. branded postpaid phone arpu excludes mobile broadband and digits customers and related revenues.
average billings per user ("abpu") represents the average monthly customer billings, including monthly lease revenues and eip billings before securitization, per customer. we believe branded postpaid abpu provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate average branded postpaid customer billings as it is indicative of estimated cash collections, including device financing payments, from our customers each month.
the following tables illustrate the calculation of our operating measures arpu and abpu and reconcile these measures to the related service revenues:

•   the negative impact from hurricanes of approximately $0.09; partially offset by
•   the mvno transaction as those customers had a lower arpu; and under existing revenue standards, t-mobile continues to expect that branded postpaid phone arpu in full-year 2018 will be generally stable compared to full-year 2017, with some quarterly variations.
we adopted asu 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606)" ("asu 2014-09"), as amended, on january 1, 2018. adoption of the standard will impact the timing, amount and allocation of our revenue and is expected to impact arpu. we will provide additional disclosures comparing results to previous gaap in our 2018 consolidated financial statements. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for information regarding recently issued accounting standards.
•   dilution from promotional activities; partially offset by
•   the positive impact from our t-mobile one rate plans prior to the release of un-carrier next in 2017 which began including taxes and fees;
•   the transfer of customers as part of the mvno transaction as those customers had lower arpu;
•   continued growth of our insurance programs; and
•   growth in the branded postpaid other customer base with lower arpu; and
•   the negative impact from hurricanes of approximately $0.08.
•   lower eip billings due to the impact of our jump! on demand program launched at the end of the second quarter of 2015;
•   dilution from increased penetration of mobile broadband devices; partially offset by
•   continued growth of metropcs customers who generate higher arpu; and
•   the optimization of our third-party distribution channels; partially offset by
•   the negative impact from hurricanes of approximately $0.05.
•   a decrease in certain customers that had lower average branded prepaid arpu, as well as higher data attach rates; partially offset by
•   dilution from growth of customers on rate plan promotions.
adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda represents earnings before interest expense, net of interest income, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation and certain income and expenses not reflective of t-mobile's operating performance. net income margin represents net income divided by service revenues. adjusted ebitda margin represents adjusted ebitda divided by service revenues.
adjusted ebitda is a non-gaap financial measure utilized by our management to monitor the financial performance of our operations. we use adjusted ebitda internally as a metric to evaluate and compensate our personnel and management for their performance, and as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors. management believes analysts and investors use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to evaluate overall operating performance and facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications companies because it is indicative of our ongoing operating performance and trends by excluding the impact of interest expense from financing, non-cash depreciation and amortization from capital investments, non-cash stock-based compensation, network decommissioning costs as they are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance and certain other nonrecurring income and expenses. adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations, net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap").
the following table illustrates the calculation of adjusted ebitda and reconciles adjusted ebitda to net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable gaap financial measure:

•   an increase in branded postpaid and prepaid service revenues primarily due to strong customer response to our un-carrier initiatives, the ongoing success of our promotional activities, and the continued strength of our metropcs brand;
•   higher other revenues; partially offset by
•   lower gains on disposal of spectrum licenses of $600 million; gains on disposal were $235 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to $835 million in the same period in 2016;
•   higher cost of services expense;
•   the negative impact from hurricanes of approximately $201 million, net of insurance recoveries.
•   increased branded postpaid and prepaid service revenues primarily due to strong customer response to our un-carrier initiatives and the ongoing success of our promotional activities;
•   higher gains on disposal of spectrum licenses of $672 million; gains on disposal were $835 million in 2016 compared to $163 million in 2015;
•   focused cost control and synergies realized from the metropcs business combination, primarily in cost of services; partially offset by effective january 1, 2017, the imputed discount on eip receivables, which was previously recognized within interest income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income, is recognized within other revenues in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. due to this presentation, the imputed discount on eip receivables is included in adjusted ebitda. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased $1.8 billion, or 30%, in 2017 primarily from:
•   $2.0 billion decrease in net non-cash adjustments to net income primarily due to changes in deferred income tax expense and depreciation and amortization, partially offset by gains on disposal of spectrum licenses; and
•   $757 million decrease in net cash outflows from changes in working capital primarily due to improvements in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, deferred purchase price from sales of receivables and accounts receivable, partially offset by changes in equipment installment plan receivables and other current and long-term assets and liabilities. the change in eip receivables was primarily due to a decrease in net cash proceeds from the sale of eip receivables as the year ended december 31, 2016 benefited from net cash proceeds of $361 million related to upsizing of the eip securitization facility.
cash provided by operating activities increased $721 million, or 13%, in 2016 primarily from:
•   $1.4 billion increase in net non-cash income and expenses included in net income primarily due to changes in depreciation and amortization, deferred income tax expense and gains on disposal of spectrum licenses; partially offset by
•   $1.4 billion increase in net cash outflows from changes in working capital primarily due to changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $1.9 billion as well as the change in equipment installment plan receivables, including inflows from the sale of certain eip receivables, partially offset by the change in inventories. net cash used for accounts payable and accrued liabilities was $1.2 billion in 2016 as compared to net cash provided by accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $693 million in 2015. net cash proceeds from the sale of eip and service receivables was $536 million in 2016 as compared to $884 million in 2015.
•   a $3.0 billion decrease in sales of short-term investments;
•   a $1.9 billion increase in purchases of spectrum licenses and other intangible assets, including deposits, primarily driven by our winning bid for 1,525 licenses in the 600 mhz spectrum auction during the second quarter of 2017; and
•   a $535 million increase in purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest primarily driven by growth in network build as we continued deployment of low band spectrum, including beginning deployment of 600 mhz.
cash used in investing activities decreased $3.9 billion, or 41%, in 2016, to a use of $5.7 billion primarily from:
•   $4.7 billion for purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest of $142 million primarily related to the build-out of our 4g lte network;
•   $4.0 billion for purchases of spectrum licenses and other intangible assets, including a $2.2 billion deposit made to a third party in connection with a potential asset purchase; partially offset by
•   $3.0 billion in sales of short-term investments.
financing activities net cash used in and provided by financing activities changed by $1.6 billion to a use of $1.2 billion, in 2017 primarily from:
•   $10.2 billion for repayments of long-term debt;
•   $2.9 billion for repayments of our revolving credit facility;
•   $486 million for repayments of capital lease obligations;
•   $427 million for repurchases of common shares; and
•   $300 million for repayments of short-term debt for purchases of inventory, property and equipment, net; partially offset by
•   $10.5 billion in proceeds from issuance of long-term debt; and cash provided by financing activities decreased $3.0 billion, or 86%, in 2016, to an inflow of $463 million primarily from:
•   $997 million in proceeds from issuance of long-term debt; partially offset by
•   $205 million for repayments of capital lease obligations;
•   $150 million for repayments of short-term debt for purchases of inventory, property and equipment, net; and cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents were $1.2 billion.
free cash flow free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less payments for purchases of property and equipment. free cash flow is a non-gaap financial measure utilized by our management, investors and analysts of t-mobile's financial information to evaluate cash available to pay debt and provide further investment in the business.
the following table illustrates the calculation of free cash flow and reconciles free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, which we consider to be the most directly comparable gaap financial measure:

•   higher net cash provided by operating activities, as described above; partially offset by
•   higher purchases of property and equipment primarily due to growth in network build as we deployed 700 mhz spectrum and began to deploy 600 mhz. cash purchases of property and equipment includes capitalized interest of $136 million and $142 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively.
•   higher net cash provided by operating activities, as described above; and
•   lower purchases of property and equipment from the build-out of our 4g lte network in 2016, as described above. cash purchases of property and equipment includes capitalized interest of $142 million and $246 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively.
we adopted asu 2016-15, "statement of cash flows (topic 230): classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments" on january 1, 2018. the standard will require a retrospective approach and impact the presentation of cash flows related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions, which is the deferred purchase price, resulting in a reclassification of cash inflows from operating activities to investing activities of approximately $4.3 billion and $3.5 billion for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, in our consolidated statements of cash flows. the standard will also impact the presentation of cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, resulting in a reclassification of cash outflows from operating activities to financing activities of $188 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, in our consolidated financial statements. in the first quarter of 2018, we plan to redefine free cash flow to reflect the above changes in classification and present cash flows on a consistent basis for investor transparency. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for information regarding recently issued accounting standards.

on january 25, 2017, t-mobile usa, inc. ("t-mobile usa"), and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, entered into an agreement to borrow $4.0 billion under a secured term loan facility ("incremental term loan facility") with dt, our majority stockholder, to refinance $1.98 billion of outstanding senior secured term loans under its term loan credit agreement dated november 9, 2015, with the remaining net proceeds from the transaction used to redeem callable high yield debt. the incremental term loan facility increased dt's incremental term loan commitment provided to t-mobile usa under that certain first incremental facility amendment dated as of december 29, 2016, from $660 million to $2.0 billion and provided t-mobile usa with an additional $2.0 billion incremental term loan commitment.
on january 31, 2017, the loans under the incremental term loan facility were drawn in two tranches: (i) $2.0 billion of which bears interest at a rate equal to a per annum rate of libor plus a margin of 2.00% and matures on november 9, 2022, and (ii) $2.0 billion of which bears interest at a rate equal to a per annum rate of libor plus a margin of 2.25% and matures on january 31, 2024. in july 2017, we repriced the $2.0 billion incremental term loan facility maturing on january 31, 2024, with dt by reducing the interest rate to a per annum rate of libor plus a margin of 2.00%. no issuance fees were incurred related to this debt agreement for the year ended december 31, 2017.
(in millions)         principal issuances (redemptions)   discounts (1)            net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt
(1)   discounts reduce proceeds from issuance of long-term debt and are included within net cash (used in) provided by financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
(2)   in april 2017, we issued to dt $750 million in aggregate principal amount of the 5.375% senior notes due 2027, and in september 2017, we issued to dt the remaining $500 million in aggregate principal amount of the 5.375% senior notes due 2027.
on march 13, 2017, dt agreed to purchase a total of $3.5 billion in aggregate principal amounts of senior notes with various interest rates and maturity dates (the "new dt notes").
through net settlement in april 2017, we issued to dt a total of $3.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of the new dt notes and redeemed the $2.5 billion in outstanding aggregate principal amount of senior reset notes with various interest rates and maturity dates (the "old dt notes").
the redemption prices of the old dt notes were 103.144% and 103.183%, resulting in a total of $79 million in early redemption fees. these early redemption fees were recorded as discounts on the issuance of the new dt notes.
in september 2017, we issued to dt $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due 2027, which is the final tranche of the new dt notes. we were not required to pay any underwriting fees or issuance costs in connection with the issuance of the notes.
net proceeds from the issuance of the new dt notes were $921 million and are included in proceeds from issuance of long-term debt in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
on may 9, 2017, we exercised our option under existing purchase agreements and issued the following senior notes to dt:
(in millions)        principal issuances           premium           net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt the proceeds were used to fund a portion of the purchase price of spectrum licenses won in the 600 mhz spectrum auction. net proceeds from these issuances include $64 million in debt premiums. see note 5 - goodwill, spectrum licenses and other intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
on january 22, 2018, dt agreed to purchase $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.500% senior notes due 2026 and $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.750% senior notes due 2028 directly from t-mobile usa and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, with no underwriting discount (the "dt notes").
dt has agreed that the payment for the dt notes will be made by delivery of $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 8.097% senior reset notes due 2021 and $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 8.195% senior reset notes due 2022 (collectively, the "dt senior reset notes") held by dt and which t-mobile usa will have called for redemption, in exchange for the dt notes. in connection with such exchange, we will pay dt in cash the premium portion of the redemption price set forth in the indenture governing the dt senior reset notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest on the dt senior reset notes to, but not including, the exchange date.
the closing of the issuance and sale of the dt notes to dt, and exchange of the dt senior reset notes, is expected to occur on or about april 30, 2018.
financing arrangements we maintain a handset financing arrangement with deutsche bank ag ("deutsche bank"), which allows for up to $108 million in borrowings. under the handset financing arrangement, we can effectively extend payment terms for invoices payable to certain handset vendors. the interest rate on the handset financing arrangement is determined based on libor plus a specified margin per the arrangement. obligations under the handset financing arrangement are included in short-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. in 2016, we utilized and repaid $100 million under the financing arrangement. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, there was no outstanding balance.
we maintain vendor financing arrangements with our primary network equipment suppliers. under the respective agreements, we can obtain extended financing terms. the interest rate on the vendor financing arrangements is determined based on the difference between libor and a specified margin per the agreements. obligations under the vendor financing arrangements are included in short-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. in 2017, we utilized and repaid $300 million under the financing arrangement. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, there was no outstanding balance.
in december 2016, t-mobile usa entered into a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility with deutsche telekom which comprised of (i) a three-year $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement and (ii) a three-year $1.5 billion secured revolving credit agreement. the applicable margin for the unsecured revolving credit facility ranges from 2.00% to 3.25% per annum for eurodollar rate loans. the applicable margin for the secured revolving credit facility ranges from 1.00% to 1.75% per annum for eurodollar rate loans. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility.
in january 2018, we utilized proceeds under the revolving credit facility to redeem $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% senior notes due 2022 and for general corporate purposes. as of february 5, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility. the proceeds and borrowings from the revolving credit facility are presented in proceeds from borrowing on revolving credit facility and repayments of revolving credit facility within net cash (used in) provided by financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
see note 7 - debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
we could seek additional sources of liquidity, including through the issuance of additional long-term debt in 2018, to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses or other assets in private party transactions or for the refinancing of existing long-term debt on an opportunistic basis. excluding liquidity that could be needed for spectrum acquisitions or other assets, we expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for business operations for the next 12 months. our intended use of any such funds is for general corporate purposes, including for capital expenditures, spectrum purchases, opportunistic investments and acquisitions, redemption of high yield callable debt and stock purchases.
we determine future liquidity requirements, for both operations and capital expenditures, based in large part upon projected financial and operating performance, and opportunities to acquire additional spectrum. we regularly review and update these projections for changes in current and projected financial and operating results, general economic conditions, the competitive landscape and other factors. there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial and operating results and capital requirements to differ materially from our projections, which could cause future liquidity to differ materially from our assessment.
the indentures and credit facilities governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding capital leases, contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the issuer and the guarantor subsidiaries (each as defined in note 16 - guarantor financial information of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form
10-k) to: incur more debt; pay dividends and make distributions on our common stock; make certain investments; repurchase stock; create liens or other encumbrances; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries; and merge, consolidate, or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. certain provisions of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties restrict the ability of the issuer to loan funds or make payments to the parent. however, the issuer is allowed to make certain permitted payments to the parent under the terms of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties. we were in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants as of december 31, 2017.
capital lease facilities we have entered into uncommitted capital lease facilities with certain partners, which provide us with the ability to enter into capital leases for network equipment and services. as of december 31, 2017, we have committed to $2.1 billion of capital leases under these capital lease facilities, of which $887 million was executed during the year ended december 31, 2017.
capital expenditures our liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses and the construction, expansion and upgrading of our network infrastructure. property and equipment capital expenditures primarily relate to our network transformation, including the build out of 700 mhz a-block and 600 mhz spectrum licenses. we expect cash purchases of property and equipment, excluding capitalized interest, to be in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion in 2018. this includes expenditures for 5g deployment. similar to 2017, cash capital expenditures will be front-end loaded in 2018 due to the build out of 600 mhz spectrum licenses. this does not include property and equipment obtained through capital lease agreements, leased wireless devices transferred from inventory or any additional purchases of spectrum licenses.
in april 2017, the fcc announced that we were the winning bidder of 1,525 licenses in the 600 mhz spectrum auction for an aggregate price of $8.0 billion. at the inception of the auction in june 2016, we deposited $2.2 billion with the fcc which, based on the outcome of the auction, was sufficient to cover our down payment obligation due in april 2017. in may 2017, we paid the fcc the remaining $5.8 billion of the purchase price using cash reserves and by issuing debt to dt, our majority stockholder, pursuant to existing debt purchase commitments. see note 7 - debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
the $5.8 billion payment of the purchase price is included in purchases of spectrum licenses and other intangible assets, including deposits within net cash used in investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. the licenses are included in spectrum licenses as of december 31, 2017, on our consolidated balance sheets. we began deployment of these licenses on our network in the third quarter of 2017. see note 5 - goodwill, spectrum licenses and other intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of december 31, 2017 and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods:
capital lease obligations, including interest and maintenance             682                     972                   218                       172                   2,044

(1)   represents principal amounts of long-term debt to affiliates and third parties at maturity, excluding unamortized premium from purchase price allocation fair value adjustment, capital lease obligations and vendor financing arrangements. see note 7 - debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
(2)   future minimum payments, including principal and interest payments and imputed lease rental income, related to the tower obligations. see note 8 - tower obligations of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
(3)   future minimum lease payments for all cell site leases presented above to include payments due for the initial non-cancelable lease term only as they represent the payments which we cannot avoid at our option and also corresponds to our lease term assessment for new leases.
(4)   the minimum commitment for certain obligations is based on termination penalties that could be paid to exit the contracts. termination penalties are included in the above table as payments due as of the earliest we could exit the contract, typically in less than one year. for certain contracts that include fixed volume purchase commitments and fixed prices for various products, the purchase obligations are calculated using fixed volumes and contractually fixed prices for the products that are expected to be purchased. this table does not include open purchase orders as of december 31, 2017 under normal business purposes. see note 13 - commitments and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
(5)   represents future undiscounted cash flows related to decommissioned metropcs cdma network and certain other redundant cell sites as of december 31, 2017.
certain commitments and obligations are included in the table based on the year of required payment or an estimate of the year of payment. other long-term liabilities, excluding network decommissioning, have been omitted from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments, combined with the absence of historical trending to be used as a predictor of such payments. see note 14 - additional financial information of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
the purchase obligations reflected in the table above are primarily commitments to purchase handsets and accessories, equipment, software, programming and network services, and marketing activities, which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business. these amounts do not represent t-mobile's entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which t-mobile is contractually committed. where t-mobile is committed to make a minimum payment to the supplier regardless of whether it takes delivery, t-mobile has included only that minimum payment as a purchase obligation. additionally, included within purchase obligations are amounts for the acquisition of spectrum licenses, which are subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.
in january 2018, we closed on a unit purchase agreement to acquire the remaining equity in ins, a 54% owned unconsolidated subsidiary, for a purchase price of $25 million. see note 13 - commitments and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
in january 2018, we closed on our previously announced acquisition of layer3 tv, inc. ("layer3 tv") for consideration of approximately $325 million, subject to customary working capital and other post-closing adjustments. upon closing of the transaction, layer3 tv became a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary. see note 13 - commitments and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
off-balance sheet arrangements in 2015, we entered into an arrangement, as amended, to sell certain eip accounts receivable on a revolving basis as an additional source of liquidity. in august 2017, the arrangement was amended to reduce the maximum funding commitment to $1.2 billion and extend the scheduled expiration date to november 2018. in december 2017, the arrangement was again amended to increase the maximum funding commitment to $1.3 billion. see note 3 - sales of certain receivables of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
in 2014, we entered into an arrangement, as amended, to sell certain service accounts receivable on a revolving basis as an additional source of liquidity. in november 2016, the arrangement was amended to increase the maximum funding commitment to $950 million and extend the scheduled expiration date to march 2018. in february 2018, the arrangement was again amended to extend the scheduled expiration date to march 2019. as of december 31, 2017, t-mobile derecognized net receivables of $2.7 billion upon sale through these arrangements. see note 3 - sales of certain receivables of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
related-party transactions during the year ended december 31, 2017, we entered into certain debt related transactions with affiliates. see note 7 - debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
we also have related party transactions associated with dt or its affiliates in the ordinary course of business, including intercompany servicing and licensing.
disclosure of iranian activities under section 13(r) of the securities exchange act of 1934
section 219 of the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 added section 13(r) to the exchange act of 1934, as amended ("exchange act"). section 13(r) requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to iran or with designated natural persons or entities involved in terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. disclosure is required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted outside the u.s. by non-u.s. affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under u.s. law.
as of the date of this report, we are not aware of any activity, transaction or dealing by us or any of our affiliates for the year ended december 31, 2017, that requires disclosure in this report under section 13(r) of the exchange act, except as set forth below with respect to affiliates that we do not control and that are our affiliates solely due to their common control with dt. we have relied upon dt for information regarding their activities, transactions and dealings.
dt, through certain of its non-u.s. subsidiaries, is party to roaming and interconnect agreements with the following mobile and fixed line telecommunication providers in iran, some of which are or may be government-controlled entities: gostaresh ertebatat taliya, irancell telecommunications services company ("mtn irancell"), telecommunication kish company, mobile telecommunication company of iran, and telecommunication infrastructure company of iran. for the year ended december 31, 2017, gross revenues of all dt affiliates generated by roaming and interconnection traffic with iran were less than $4 million and estimated net profits were less than $4 million.
in addition, dt, through certain of its non-u.s. subsidiaries, operating a fixed line network in their respective european home countries (in particular germany), provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to the embassy of iran in those european countries. gross revenues and net profits recorded from these activities for the year ended december 31, 2017 were less than $0.4 million. we understand that dt intends to continue these activities.
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition as they require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
six of these policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. actual results could differ from those estimates.
management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies.
allowances we maintain an allowance for credit losses, which is management's estimate of such losses inherent in the receivables portfolio, comprised of accounts receivable and eip receivable segments. changes in the allowance for credit losses and, therefore, in related provision for credit losses ("bad debt expense") can materially affect earnings. credit risk characteristics are assessed for each receivable segment. in applying the judgment and review required to determine the allowance for credit losses, management considers a number of factors, including customer behavior, credit quality of the customer base and other qualitative factors such as macro-economic conditions. while our methodology attributes portions of the allowance to specific portfolio segments, the entire allowance for credit losses is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total receivables portfolio.
management also considers an amount that represents management's judgment of risks inherent in the process and assumptions used in establishing the allowance for credit losses, including process risk and other subjective factors, including industry trends and emerging risk assessments.
to the extent that actual loss experience differs significantly from historical trends or assumptions, the appropriate allowance levels for realized credit losses could differ from the estimate. we write off account balances if collection efforts are unsuccessful and the receivable balance is deemed uncollectible, based on customer credit ratings and the length of time from the original billing date.
we offer certain retail customers the option to pay for their devices and other purchases in installments over a period of up to 24 months using a zero interest eip. at the time of an installment sale, we impute a discount for interest and record the eip receivables at their present value, which is determined by discounting future payments at the imputed interest rate. the difference between the present value of the eip receivables and their face amount results in a discount which is recorded as a direct reduction to the carrying value of the eip receivable with a corresponding reduction to equipment revenue. the imputed discount rate is primarily comprised of current market interest rates and the estimated credit risk on the eip receivables. as a result, we do not recognize a separate valuation allowance at the time of issuance as the effects of uncertainty about future cash flows are included in the initial present value measurement of the eip receivable. the imputed discount on eip receivables is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and recognized as other revenues in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
subsequent to the initial determination of the imputed discount, we recognize an allowance for credit losses to the extent the amount of estimated credit losses on the gross eip receivable segment exceed the remaining unamortized imputed discount balances.
total imputed discount and allowances as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 was approximately 8.1% and 8.0%, respectively, of the total amount of gross accounts receivable, including eip receivables.
depreciation depreciation commences once assets have been placed in service. we generally depreciate property and equipment over the period the property and equipment provide economic benefit. leased wireless devices are depreciated to their estimated residual value over the period expected to provide utility to t-mobile, which is generally shorter than the lease term and considers expected losses. depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property, plant and equipment. these studies consider actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution. when these factors indicate that an asset's useful life is different from the previous assessment, the remaining book values are depreciated prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies and note 4 - property and equipment of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for information regarding depreciation of assets, including management's underlying estimates of useful lives.
evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment we assess the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our spectrum licenses, for potential impairment annually as of december 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired.
when assessing goodwill for impairment we may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. if we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative test. we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a market approach, which is based on market capitalization. we recognize market capitalization is subject to volatility and will monitor changes in market capitalization to determine whether declines, if any, necessitate an interim impairment review. in the event market capitalization does decline below its book value, we will consider the length, severity and reasons for the decline when assessing whether potential impairment exists, including considering whether a control premium should be added to the market capitalization. we believe short-term fluctuations in share price may not necessarily reflect the underlying aggregate fair value.
we test spectrum licenses for impairment on an aggregate basis, consistent with the management of the overall business at a national level. we may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying value. if we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset. if the carrying amount of spectrum licenses exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. we estimate the fair value of the spectrum licenses using the greenfield approach, which is an income approach that estimates the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. the greenfield approach values the spectrum licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the asset to be valued (in this case, spectrum licenses). the value of the spectrum licenses can be considered as equal to the present value of the cash flows of this hypothetical start-up company. we base the assumptions underlying the greenfield approach on a combination of market participant data and our historical results, trends and business plans. future cash flows in the greenfield approach are based on estimates and assumptions of market participant revenues, ebitda margin, network build-out period and a long-term growth rate for a market participant. the cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital.
the valuation approaches utilized to estimate fair value for the purposes of the impairment tests of goodwill and spectrum licenses require the use of assumptions and estimates, which involve a degree of uncertainty. if actual results or future expectations are not consistent with the assumptions, this may result in the recording of significant impairment charges on goodwill or spectrum licenses. the most significant assumptions within the valuation models are the discount rate, revenues, ebitda margins, capital expenditures and the long-term growth rate. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies and note 5 - goodwill, spectrum licenses and other intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for information regarding our annual impairment test and impairment charges.
guarantee liabilities we offer a device trade-in program, jump!, which provides eligible customers a specified-price trade-in right to upgrade their device. upon enrollment, participating customers must finance the purchase of a device on an eip and have a qualifying t-mobile monthly wireless service plan, which is treated as a single multiple-element arrangement when entered into at or near the same time. upon qualifying jump! program upgrades, the customers' remaining eip balance is settled provided they trade-in their eligible used device in good working condition and purchase a new device from us on a new eip.
for customers who enroll in jump!, we establish a liability through the reduction of revenue, for the portion of revenue which represents the estimated fair value of the specified-price trade-in right guarantee. the guarantee liability is valued based on various economic and customer behavioral assumptions, which requires judgment, including estimating the customer's remaining eip balance at trade-in, the expected fair value of the used device at trade-in, and the probability and timing of trade-in. when customers upgrade their device, the difference between the eip balance credit to the customer and the fair value of the returned device is recorded against the guarantee liabilities. all assumptions are reviewed periodically.
rent expense most of the leases on our tower sites have fixed rent escalations which provide for periodic increases in the amount of rent payable over time. we calculate straight-line rent expense for each of these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes a penalty on us in such amount that a renewal appears, at lease inception or significant modification, to be reasonably assured. we consider several factors in assessing whether renewal periods are reasonably assured of being exercised, including the continued maturation of our network nationwide, technological advances within the telecommunications industry and the availability of alternative sites. we make significant assumptions at lease inception in determining and assessing the factors that constitute a "penalty." in doing so, we primarily consider costs incurred in acquiring and developing new sites, the useful life of site improvements and equipment costs, future economic conditions and the extent to which improvements in wireless technologies can be incorporated into a current assessment of whether an economic compulsion will exist in the future to renew a lease.
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these differences are realized. a valuation allowance is maintained against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions within the carryforward periods available. we consider many factors when determining whether a valuation allowance is needed, including recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future income, the carryforward periods available for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors.
we account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. we assess whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position and adjust the unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law.

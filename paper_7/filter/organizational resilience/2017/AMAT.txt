item 7:   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is intended to facilitate an understanding of applied's business and results of operations. this md&a should be read in conjunction with applied's consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k. the following discussion contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement set forth at the beginning of this form 10-k. md&a consists of the following sections:
•   overview: a summary of applied's business and measurements
•   results of operations: a discussion of operating results
•   segment information: a discussion of segment operating results
•   recent accounting pronouncements: a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and its impact to applied's consolidated financial statements
•   financial condition, liquidity and capital resources: an analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash
•   off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations
•   critical accounting policies and estimates: a discussion of critical accounting policies that require the exercise of judgments and estimates
•   non-gaap adjusted results: a presentation of results reconciling gaap to non-gaap adjusted measures overview applied provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the semiconductor, display, and related industries. applied's customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips, liquid crystal and organic light-emitting diode (oled) displays, and other electronic devices. these customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components. each of applied's businesses is subject to variable industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips, display technologies, and other electronic devices, as well as other factors, such as global economic and market conditions, and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes.
applied operates in three reportable segments: semiconductor systems, applied global services, and display and adjacent markets. a summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements. a discussion of factors that could affect applied's operations is set forth under "risk factors" in part i, item 1a, which is incorporated herein by reference. product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in the united states, europe, israel, and asia. applied's broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force.
applied's results are driven primarily by customer spending on capital equipment and services to support key technology transitions or to increase production volume in response to worldwide demand for semiconductors and displays. spending by semiconductor customers, which include companies that operate in the foundry, memory and logic markets, is driven by demand for advanced electronic products, including smartphones and other mobile devices, servers, personal computers, automotive devices, storage, and other products. the growth of data and new end-market drivers such as artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality and smart vehicles are also creating new opportunities for the industry. as a result, products within the semiconductor systems segment are subject to significant changes in customer requirements, including transitions to smaller dimensions, increasingly complex chip architectures, new materials and an increasing number of applications. demand for display manufacturing equipment spending depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs as well as larger and higher resolution displays for next generation mobile devices, and investments in new types of display technologies. while certain existing technologies may be adapted to new requirements, some applications create the need for an entirely different technological approach. the timing of customer investment in manufacturing equipment is also affected by the timing of next generation production schedules, and the timing of capacity expansion to meet end market demand. in light of these conditions, applied's results can vary significantly year-over-year, as well as quarter-over-quarter.
applied's strategic priorities include developing products that help solve customers' challenges at technology inflections; expanding its served market opportunities in the semiconductor and display industries; and growing its services business. applied's long-term growth strategy requires continued development of new materials engineering capabilities, including products and platforms that enable expansion into new and adjacent markets. applied's significant investments in research, development and engineering must generally enable it to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand, thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing plans during early-stage technology selection. applied works closely with its global customers to design systems and processes that meet their planned technical and production requirements.

marketing and selling expenses increased in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to additional headcount, partially offset by the reduction in bad debt provision recorded during fiscal 2017. marketing and selling expenses remained relatively flat in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.
marketing and selling expenses for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 included $28 million, $26 million and $26 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.
change general and administrative (g&a) expenses in fiscal 2017 increased compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher variable compensation and additional headcount. g&a expenses for fiscal 2016 decreased compared to fiscal 2015. g&a expenses were higher in fiscal 2015 primarily due to acquisition-related and integration costs related to the terminated business combination with tokyo electron limited (tel), impact of foreign currency exchange loss as a result of functional currency correction, and restructuring charges, all recorded during fiscal 2015.
g&a expenses during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 included $40 million, $37 million and $35 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.
loss (gain) on derivatives associated with terminated business combination during fiscal 2015, applied recorded a gain on derivatives associated with the terminated business combination with tel which resulted from exchange rate fluctuations and the sale of derivative contracts in fiscal 2015. for further details, see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
change interest expenses incurred were primarily associated with the senior unsecured notes issued in june 2011, september 2015, and march 2017. interest expense in fiscal 2017 increased compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to the issuance of senior unsecured notes in march 2017. interest expense for fiscal 2016 increased compared to fiscal 2015 due to the issuance of senior unsecured notes in september 2015.
interest and other income, net primarily includes interest earned on cash and investments, realized gains or losses on sales of securities and impairment of strategic investments. interest and other income, net in fiscal 2017 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to higher interest income from investments, partially offset by higher impairment of strategic investments in fiscal 2017.
interest and other income, net in fiscal 2016 increased compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher interest income from investments, partially offset by a $5 million loss from prepayment of $400 million debt.
change effective income tax rate        8.0   %          14.5   %          13.8   %             (6.5) points               0.7 points applied's provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are affected by the geographical composition of pre-tax income which includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates, conditional reduced tax rates and other income tax incentives. it is also affected by events that are not consistent from period to period, such as changes in income tax laws and the resolution of prior years' income tax filings.
applied's effective tax rates for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were 8.0%, 14.5% and 13.8%, respectively. the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was lower than the prior year primarily due to the recognition of previously unrecognized foreign tax credits and changes in the geographical composition of income. in addition, the effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 included unfavorable resolutions and changes related to income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions as well as the reinstatement of the u.s. federal r&d tax credit retroactive to its expiration in december of 2015, neither of which reoccurred in fiscal 2017.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was higher than fiscal 2015 primarily due to resolutions and changes related to income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by changes in the geographical composition of income. the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 included an adjustment to decrease provision for income taxes of $28 million primarily to correct an error in the recognition of cost of sales in the u.s. related to intercompany sales. the impact of the adjustment to fiscal 2015 was determined to be immaterial on the originating periods and fiscal 2015.
segment information applied reports financial results in three segments: semiconductor systems, applied global services, and display and adjacent markets. a description of the products and services, as well as financial data, for each reportable segment can be found in note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
the corporate and other category includes revenues from products, as well as costs of products sold, for fabricating solar photovoltaic cells and modules and certain operating expenses that are not allocated to its reportable segments and are managed separately at the corporate level. these operating expenses include costs for share-based compensation; certain management, finance, legal, human resource, and rd&e functions provided at the corporate level; and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy. in addition, applied does not allocate to its reportable segments restructuring and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions, unless these actions pertain to a specific reportable segment.
semiconductor systems segment the semiconductor systems segment is comprised primarily of capital equipment used to fabricate semiconductor chips. semiconductor industry spending on capital equipment is driven by demand for advanced electronic products, including smartphones and other mobile devices, servers, personal computers, automotive devices, storage, and other products, and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes, and as a result is subject to variable industry conditions. development efforts are focused on solving customers' key technical challenges in transistor, interconnect, patterning and packaging performance as devices scale to advanced technology nodes.
during fiscal 2017, the market for semiconductor systems products and technologies was characterized by continued healthy investment by semiconductor manufacturers. memory manufacturers invested in technology upgrades and new capacity, driven by the transition from planar nand to 3d nand, and an overall increase in demand for memory for high performance storage in data centers and increasing smartphone content. foundry customers also invested in technology upgrades and new capacity to meet demand for advanced mobile chips.

recent accounting pronouncements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on applied's consolidated financial statements, see note 1, "summary of significant accounting policies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
financial condition, liquidity and capital resources applied's cash, cash equivalents and investments consist of the following:
sources and uses of cash a summary of cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities is as follows:
cash provided by operating activities                $3,609           $2,466                 $1,163
operating activities cash from operating activities for fiscal 2017 was $3.6 billion, which reflects net income adjusted for the effect of non-cash charges and changes in working capital components. non-cash charges included depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation and deferred income taxes. cash provided by operating activities increased from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher net income, offset by a smaller increase in customer deposits and a greater increase in inventory in fiscal 2017. the primary drivers of the increase in cash from operating activities from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 included higher net income and increases in customer deposits, deferred revenue, accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by higher increases in accounts receivable.
applied has agreements with various financial institutions to sell accounts receivable and discount promissory notes from selected customers. applied sells its accounts receivable without recourse. applied, from time to time, also discounts letters of credit issued by customers through various financial institutions. the discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements. applied sold $746 million and $75 million of accounts receivable during fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. applied did not sell accounts receivable during fiscal 2015. applied did not discount promissory notes or utilize programs to discount letters of credit issued by customers during any of the past three fiscal years.
applied's working capital was $8.8 billion at october 29, 2017 and $4.7 billion at october 30, 2016.
days sales outstanding at the end of fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was 54 days, 63 days, and 67 days, respectively. days sales outstanding varies due to the timing of shipments and payment terms, and the decrease from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to better collections performance and increase in factoring of accounts receivable. days sales outstanding decreased at the end of fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher revenue and sales of accounts receivable.
investing activities applied used $2.5 billion, $425 million, and $281 million of cash in investing activities in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. capital expenditures in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $345 million, $253 million and $215 million, respectively. capital expenditures in all three fiscal years were primarily for demonstration and test equipment and laboratory tools in north america. purchases of investments, net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments were $2.1 billion, $156 million, and $62 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. in november 2017, applied acquired additional property for $100 million in cash to support the company's growth. investing activities also included investments in technology to allow applied to access new market opportunities or emerging technologies.
applied's investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade money market mutual funds, u.s. treasury and agency securities, municipal bonds, corporate bonds and mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, as well as equity securities. applied regularly monitors the credit risk in its investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures, which may include the sale of certain securities, to manage such risks prudently in accordance with its investment policies.
financing activities applied generated $521 million of cash from financing activities in fiscal 2017, consisting primarily of net proceeds received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes of $2.2 billion, proceeds from common stock issuances of $97 million and excess tax benefits from share-based compensation of $55 million, partially offset by cash used for repurchases of common stock of $1.2 billion, cash dividends to stockholders of $430 million and debt repayments of $205 million.
applied used $3.4 billion of cash in financing activities in fiscal 2016, consisting primarily $1.2 billion in debt repayments, $1.9 billion in repurchases of its common stock, and $444 million in cash dividends to stockholders, offset by excess tax benefits from share-based compensation of $23 million and proceeds from common stock issuances of $88 million.
applied generated $913 million of cash from financing activities in fiscal 2015, consisting primarily of net proceeds received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes of $1.8 billion and short-term borrowings of $800 million, offset by cash used for repurchases of its common stock of $1.3 billion and payments of cash dividends of $487 million.
in june 2016, applied's board of directors approved a common stock repurchase program authorizing up to $2.0 billion in repurchases, which followed the completion of a $3.0 billion common stock repurchase program approved in april 2015. in september 2017, applied's board of directors approved an additional common stock repurchase program authorizing up to an additional $3.0 billion in repurchases. at october 29, 2017, $3.6 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under these repurchase programs. proceeds from stock issuances under equity compensation awards and related excess tax benefits in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $152 million, $111 million and $144 million, respectively.
during each of fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, applied's board of directors declared quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.10 per share. applied currently anticipates that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on applied's financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination by the board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of applied's stockholders.
applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to $1.6 billion, of which $1.5 billion is comprised of a committed revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is scheduled to expire in september 2021. this agreement provides for borrowings in united states dollars at interest rates keyed to one of two rates selected by applied for each advance and includes financial and other covenants with which applied was in compliance at october 29, 2017. remaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately $70 million are with japanese banks. applied's ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request, and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks' prime reference rate denominated in japanese yen. no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities at both october 29, 2017 and october 30, 2016, and applied has not utilized these credit facilities.
in fiscal 2011, applied established a short-term commercial paper program of up to $1.5 billion. at october 29, 2017 and october 30, 2016, applied did not have any commercial paper outstanding, but may issue commercial paper notes under this program from time to time in the future.
in march 2017, applied issued senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2.2 billion. applied had senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5.4 billion outstanding as of october 29, 2017. the indentures governing these notes include covenants with which applied was in compliance at october 29, 2017. in may 2017, applied completed the redemption of the entire outstanding $200 million in principal amount of senior notes due in october 2017. in november 2015, applied completed the redemption of the entire outstanding $400 million in principal amount of senior notes due in 2016. see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of existing debt. applied may seek to refinance its existing debt and may incur additional indebtedness depending on applied's capital requirements and the availability of financing.
others during 2017 and 2015, applied reduced $17 million and $9 million, respectively, of its allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of an overall lower risk profile of applied's customers. applied recorded a bad debt provision of $3 million in fiscal 2016. while applied believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts at october 29, 2017 is adequate, it will continue to closely monitor customer liquidity and economic conditions.
as of october 29, 2017, approximately $5.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries may be subject to u.s. income taxes if repatriated for u.s. operations. applied intends to indefinitely reinvest approximately $4.5 billion of these funds outside of the u.s. and does not plan to repatriate these funds. applied would need to accrue and pay u.s. taxes if these funds were repatriated. for the remaining cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries, u.s. income taxes have been provided for in the financial statements.
although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above, applied's management believes that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to satisfy applied's liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. for further details regarding applied's operating, investing and financing activities, see the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report.
for details on standby letters of credit and other agreements with banks, see off-balance sheet arrangements below.
off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either applied or its subsidiaries. as of october 29, 2017, the maximum potential amount of future payments that applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately $57 million. applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. applied does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee agreements.
applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft arrangements, issuance of bank guarantees, and letters of credit. as of october 29, 2017, applied materials inc. has provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately $140 million to cover these arrangements.
applied also has operating leases for various facilities. total rent expense for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $34 million, $38 million and $32 million, respectively.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes applied's contractual obligations as of october 29, 2017:
operating lease obligations                               101       33                                     40                   17                       11
1   represents applied's agreements to purchase goods and services consisting of applied's outstanding purchase orders for goods and services.
2   other long-term liabilities in the table do not include pension, post-retirement and deferred compensation plans due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments. applied evaluates the need to make contributions to its pension and post-retirement benefit plans after considering the funded status of the plans, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. payments to the plans would be dependent on these factors and could vary across a wide range of amounts and time periods. payments for deferred compensation plans are dependent on activity by participants, making the timing of payments uncertain. information on applied's pension, post-retirement benefit and deferred compensation plans is presented in note 12, employee benefit plans, of the consolidated financial statements.
3   applied's other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets include deferred tax liabilities, gross unrecognized tax benefits and related gross interest and penalties. as of october 29, 2017, the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits that was not expected to result in payment of cash within one year was $391 million. interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions that were not expected to result in payment of cash within one year of october 29, 2017 was $46 million. at this time, applied is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies.
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied's consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied's financial condition or results of operations. specifically, these policies have the following attributes: (1) applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and (2) different estimates applied could reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on applied's financial condition or results of operations.
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. these estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as applied's operating environment changes. these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known. in addition, management is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time. these uncertainties include those discussed in part i, item 1a, "risk factors." based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that applied's consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, and provide a meaningful presentation of applied's financial condition and results of operations.
management believes that the following are critical accounting policies and estimates:
revenue recognition applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is probable. each sale arrangement may contain commercial terms that differ from other arrangements. in addition, applied frequently enters into contracts that contain multiple deliverables. judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units. moreover, judgment is used in interpreting the commercial terms and determining when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period. while changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the units of accounting will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement, any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on applied's financial condition and results of operations.
warranty costs applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized. estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product, current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs. applied's warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates, material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period. as applied's customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally, labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs. the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs. unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs. if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied's estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
allowance for doubtful accounts applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. this allowance is based on historical experience, credit evaluations, specific customer collection history and any customer-specific issues applied has identified. changes in circumstances, such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer's ability to meet its financial obligation to applied or its payment trends, may require applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to applied, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
inventory valuation inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand. applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand. in addition, inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products. if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated, additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
goodwill and intangible assets applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable, and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment. intangible assets, such as purchased technology, are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition. the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value.
to test goodwill for impairment, applied first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. if it is concluded that this is the case, applied then performs the two-step goodwill impairment test. otherwise, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. under the two-step goodwill impairment test, applied would in the first step compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, applied would then perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. if applied determines that the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, applied would record an impairment charge equal to the difference.
applied determines the fair value of each reporting unit based on a weighting of an income and a market approach. applied bases the fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. under the income approach, applied estimates the fair value based on discounted cash flow method.
the estimates used in the impairment testing are consistent with the discrete forecasts that applied uses to manage its business, and considers any significant developments during the period. under the discounted cash flow method, cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts are estimated using a terminal growth rate, which considers the long-term earnings growth rate specific to the reporting units. the estimated future cash flows are discounted to present value using each reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital. the weighted average cost of capital measures a reporting unit's cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and equity in a reporting unit's target capital structure. in addition, the weighted average cost of capital is derived using both known and estimated market metrics, and is adjusted to reflect both the timing and risks associated with the estimated cash flows. the tax rate used in the discounted cash flow method is the median tax rate of comparable companies and reflects applied's current international structure, which is consistent with the market participant perspective. under the market approach, applied uses the guideline company method which applies market multiples to forecasted revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. applied uses market multiples that are consistent with comparable publicly-traded companies and considers each reporting unit's size, growth and profitability relative to its comparable companies.
management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment, especially in emerging markets. indicators of potential impairment include, but are not limited to, challenging economic conditions, an unfavorable industry or economic environment or other severe decline in market conditions. such conditions could have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates used for the fair value calculation, resulting in an unexpected goodwill impairment charge, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations. see note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of goodwill impairment.
income taxes applied's provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are affected by the geographical composition of pre-tax income which includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates, conditional reduced tax rates and other income tax incentives. it is also affected by events that are not consistent from period to period, such as changes to income tax laws and the resolution of prior years' income tax filings.
applied recognizes a current tax liability for the estimated amount of income tax payable on tax returns for the current fiscal year. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets are also recognized for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance to the extent it is more likely than not that they are not expected to be realized.
applied recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized from such positions are estimated based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. any changes in judgment related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in applied's provision for income taxes in the quarter in which such change occurs. interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in applied's provision for income taxes.
the calculation of applied's provision for income taxes and effective tax rate involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied's expectations could have an adverse material impact on applied's results of operations and financial condition.
non-gaap adjusted financial results management uses non-gaap adjusted financial measures to evaluate the company's operating and financial performance and for planning purposes, and as performance measures in its executive compensation program. applied believes these measures enhance an overall understanding of our performance and investors' ability to review the company's business from the same perspective as the company's management and facilitate comparisons of this period's results with prior periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance.
the non-gaap adjusted financial measures presented below are adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses, including certain items related to mergers and acquisitions; restructuring charges and any associated adjustments; impairments of assets, or investments; gain or loss on sale of strategic investments; certain other discrete adjustments and income tax items. reconciliations of these non-gaap measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap are provided in the financial tables presented below. there are limitations in using non-gaap financial measures because the non-gaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, may be different from non-gaap financial measures used by other companies, and may exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. the presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap.

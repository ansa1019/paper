item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview open surgery remains the predominant form of surgery and is used in almost every area of the body. however, the large incisions required for open surgery create trauma to patients, typically resulting in longer hospitalization and recovery times, increased hospitalization costs, and additional pain and suffering relative to minimally invasive surgery ("mis"), where mis is available. for over three decades, mis has reduced trauma to patients by allowing selected surgeries to be performed through small ports rather than large incisions. mis has been widely adopted for certain surgical procedures.
da vinci surgical systems enable surgeons to extend the benefits of mis to many patients who would otherwise undergo a more invasive surgery by using computational, robotic and imaging technologies to overcome many of the limitations of traditional open surgery or conventional mis. surgeons using a da vinci surgical system operate while seated comfortably at a console viewing a 3d high definition image of the surgical field. this immersive console connects surgeons to the surgical field and their instruments. while seated at the console, the surgeon manipulates instrument controls in a natural manner, similar to open surgical technique. our technology is designed to provide surgeons with a range of articulation of the surgical instruments used in the surgical field analogous to the motions of a human wrist, while filtering out the tremor inherent in a surgeon's hand. in designing our products, we focus on making our technology easy and safe to use.
our products fall into five broad categories: da vinci surgical systems, da vinci instruments, da vinci stapling, da vinci energy, and da vinci vision, including firefly fluorescence imaging systems ("firefly"), and da vinci endoscopes. we also provide a comprehensive suite of services, training, and education programs. within our integrated ecosystem, our products are designed to decrease variability in surgery by offering dependable, consistent functionality and user experiences for surgeons seeking better outcomes. we take a holistic 'systems' approach to offer intelligent technology and systems designed to work together to make mis intervention more available and applicable.
we have commercialized the following da vinci surgical systems: the da vinci standard surgical system in 1999, the da vinci s surgical system in 2006, the da vinci si surgical system in 2009, and the fourth generation da vinci xi surgical system, commercialized in 2014. we have extended our fourth generation platform, by adding the da vinci x surgical system, commercialized in the second quarter of 2017 and the da vinci sp surgical system in the third quarter of 2018. we are early in the launch of our da vinci sp surgical system and placed 15 da vinci sp systems in 2018. our rollout of the da vinci sp surgical system will be measured, putting systems in the hands of experienced da vinci users first while we optimize training pathways and our supply chain. we received clearances for the da vinci sp surgical system for urological surgical procedures in the u.s. and south korea as well as some other procedure types in south korea. we plan to seek u.s. fda clearances for additional indications for da vinci sp over time. the success of the da vinci sp product is dependent on positive experiences and improved clinical outcomes for the procedures it has been cleared for and as well as securing additional clinical clearances. all da vinci systems include a surgeon's console (or consoles), imaging electronics, a patient-side cart, and computational hardware and software.
we offer over 80 different multi-port da vinci instruments to provide surgeons' flexibility in choosing the types of tools needed to perform a particular surgery. these multi-port instruments are generally robotically controlled and provide end effectors (tips) that are similar to those used in either open or laparoscopic surgery. we offer advanced instrumentation for the da vinci si, da vinci xi, and da vinci x platforms, including the da vinci vessel sealer extend and da vinci stapler products, to provide surgeons with sophisticated, computer-aided tools to precisely and efficiently interact with tissue. da vinci x and da vinci xi surgical systems use instruments that are compatible with both x and xi systems whereas the da vinci si surgical system uses instruments that are not compatible with x or xi systems. initially we are offering nine core instruments on our da vinci sp surgical system. we plan to expand the sp instrument offering over time.
we offer single-site instruments for use with the da vinci si, da vinci xi, and da vinci x surgical systems. single-site instruments are most commonly used in cholecystectomy and hysterectomy procedures. single-site instruments are designed to enable surgeons to perform surgery through a single port via the patient's umbilicus, resulting in the potential for significantly reduced scarring.
training technologies include our da vinci skills simulator, da vinci connect remote case observation and mentoring tool, and our dual console for use in surgeon proctoring and collaborative surgery.
business model overview we generate revenue from placements of da vinci surgical systems in sale or sales-type lease arrangements where revenue is recognized up-front or in operating lease transactions where revenue is recognized over time. we earn recurring revenue from sales of instruments, accessories, and service, as well as the revenue from operating leases. the da vinci surgical system generally sells for approximately between $0.5 million and $2.5 million, depending upon the model, configuration and geography, and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers when purchased. our instruments and accessories have limited lives and will either expire or wear out as they are used in surgery, at which point they need to be replaced. we earn between approximately $700 to $3,500 of instrument and accessory revenue per surgical procedure performed, depending on the type and complexity of the specific procedures performed and the number and type of instruments used. we typically enter into service contracts at the time systems are sold at an annual fee of approximately $80,000 to $190,000, depending upon the configuration of the underlying system and composition of the services offered under the contract. these service contracts have generally been renewed at the end of the initial contractual service periods.
we adopted asc 606, revenue from contracts with customers, effective january 1, 2018, using the full retrospective method. the financial results for 2016 and 2017 have been restated to reflect this adoption. the adoption did not have a material impact on revenue recognized for the periods presented in our financial statements. refer to "note 2. summary of significant accounting policies" within part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information on the impact of adopting asc 606.
recurring revenue recurring revenue consists of instrument and accessory revenue, service revenue, and operating lease revenue. recurring revenue increased to $2.6 billion, or 71% of total revenue in 2018, compared with $2.2 billion, or 71% of total revenue in 2017, and $1.9 billion, or 71% of total revenue in 2016.
instrument and accessory revenue has grown at a faster rate than system revenue over time. instrument and accessory revenue increased to $2.0 billion in 2018, compared with $1.6 billion in 2017 and $1.4 billion in 2016. the growth of instrument and accessory revenue largely reflects continued procedure adoption.
service revenue growth has been driven by the growth of the base of installed da vinci surgical systems. the installed base of da vinci surgical systems grew 13% to approximately 4,986 at december 31, 2018; 13% to approximately 4,409 at december 31, 2017; and 9% to approximately 3,919 at december 31, 2016. service revenue grew 11% to $635.1 million in 2018; 12% to $572.9 million in 2017; and 10% to $510.7 million in 2016.
operating lease revenue has grown as a larger proportion of systems shipped are under operating lease arrangements. in the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, a total of 229, 108, and 62 of system placements were classified as operating leases, respectively. revenue from operating lease arrangements is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term or based upon system usage. operating lease revenue for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, was $51.4 million, $25.9 million and $16.6 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2018, a total of 350 da vinci surgical systems were installed at customers under operating lease arrangements.
intuitive surgical da vinci system leasing since 2013, we have entered into sales-type and operating lease arrangements directly with certain qualified customers as a way to offer customers flexibility in how they acquire da vinci surgical systems and expand robotic-assisted surgery availability while leveraging our balance sheet. these leases generally have commercially competitive terms as compared with other third-party entities that offer equipment leasing. we include both operating and sales-type leases in our system shipment and installed base disclosures. we exclude operating leases from our system average selling price ("asp") computations.
in the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we shipped 272, 139, and 95 systems under lease arrangements, respectively, of which 229, 108, and 62 were classified as operating leases, respectively. generally, the operating lease arrangements provide our customers with the right to purchase the leased system at some point during and/or at the end of the lease term. revenue generated from customer purchases of systems under operating lease arrangements ("lease buyouts") was $48.8 million, $39.5 million, and $38.2 million for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. we expect that revenue recognized from customer exercises of the buyout options will fluctuate based on the timing of when, and if, customers choose to exercise their buyout options. we believe our leasing program has been effective and well-received, and we are willing to expand it based on customer demand, including alternative structures such as usage-based payment models. our da vinci system leasing provides customers with flexibility regarding how they acquire da vinci surgical systems. generally, lease transactions generate similar gross margins as our sale transactions. our exposure to the credit risks relating to our lease financing arrangements may increase if our customers are adversely affected by changes in healthcare laws, coverage and reimbursement, economic pressures or uncertainty, or other customer-specific factors. also, usage-based leases generally contain no minimum lease payments; therefore, customers may exit such leases without paying a financial penalty to us.
systems revenue system placements are driven by procedure growth in most markets. in geographies where da vinci procedure adoption is in an early stage, system sales will precede procedure growth. system placements also vary due to seasonality largely aligned with hospital budgeting cycles. we typically place a higher proportion of annual system placements in the fourth quarter and a lower proportion in the first quarter as budgets are reset. system revenue grew 21% to $1,127.1 million in 2018; 16% to $928.4 million in 2017; and 11% to $800.0 million in 2016. system revenue is also affected by the proportion of systems placed that are under operating lease arrangements, recurring operating lease revenue, operating lease buyouts, product mix, asps, and trade-in activities.
procedure mix / products our da vinci surgical systems are generally used for soft tissue surgery for areas of the body between the pelvis and the neck, primarily in general surgery, gynecologic surgery, urologic surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, and head and neck surgery. within these categories, procedures range in complexity from cancer and other highly complex procedures to less complex procedures for benign conditions. cancer and other highly complex procedures tend to be reimbursed at higher rates than less complex procedures for benign conditions. thus, hospitals are more sensitive to the costs associated with treating less complex benign conditions. our strategy is to provide hospitals with attractive clinical and economic solutions across the spectrum of procedure complexity. our fully featured da vinci xi surgical system with advanced instruments, including the endowrist vessel sealer, endowrist stapler products, and our integrated table motion product target the more complex procedure segment. our da vinci x surgical system and single-site instruments are targeted towards price sensitive markets and procedures.
procedure seasonality more than half of da vinci procedures performed are for benign conditions, most notably benign hysterectomies, hernia repairs, and cholecystectomies. these benign procedures and other short-term elective procedures tend to be more seasonal than cancer operations and surgeries for other life threatening conditions. seasonality in the u.s. for these procedures for benign conditions typically results in higher fourth quarter procedure volume when more patients have met annual deductibles and lower first quarter procedure volume when deductibles are reset. seasonality outside the u.s. varies and is more pronounced around local holidays and vacation periods.
distribution channels we provide our products through direct sales organizations in the u.s., europe (excluding spain, portugal, italy, greece, most eastern european countries), japan, south korea, india, and taiwan. in may and december 2018, we began direct operations in india and taiwan, respectively. in the remainder of our ous markets, we provide our products through distributors. chindex, a subsidiary of fosun pharma, has been our distribution partner for da vinci surgical systems in china. in january 2019, the joint venture acquired certain assets related to the distribution business of chindex and began direct operations for da vinci products and services in china.
regulatory activities clearances and approvals we have obtained the clearances required to market our multi-port products associated with all of our da vinci surgical systems (standard, s, si, xi, and x systems) for our targeted surgical specialties within the u.s., south korea, and the european markets in which we operate.
in december 2018, we received clearance for our da vinci xi surgical system in china. the xi clearance does not include advanced energy, stapling, or wireless table motion products which attach to the xi system. separate clearances are required for each of these products by china national medical products administration ("nmpa").
in may 2018, we obtained u.s. fda clearance for the da vinci sp surgical system for urologic surgical procedures that are appropriate for a single port approach. we also received regulatory clearance for the da vinci sp surgical system in south korea in may 2018. we plan to launch the da vinci sp surgical system in a measured fashion and placed 15 da vinci sp systems with customers in 2018.
in october 2018, the china national health commission published on its official website the quota for major medical equipment to be imported and sold in china through 2020. the government will allow the sale of 154 new surgical robots into china, which could include da vinci surgical systems as well as surgical systems introduced by others. sales of da vinci surgical systems under the quote are uncertain, as they are dependent on hospitals completing a tender process and receiving associated approvals.
in july 2018, we received u.s. fda clearance to market sureform 60, our da vinci endowrist 60mm stapler. in january 2019, we received u.s. fda clearance to market sureform 45 (see the description of the sureform 45 and 60 staplers in the new product introductions section below).
in april 2018, we received u.s. fda clearance for our vessel sealer extend (see the description of the da vinci vessel sealer extend in the new product introductions section below).
in april 2017, we received ce mark clearance for our da vinci x surgical system in europe. following the ce mark, in may 2017, we received u.s. fda clearance to market our da vinci x surgical system in the u.s. we received regulatory clearance for the da vinci x surgical system in south korea and japan in september 2017 and april 2018, respectively (see the description of the da vinci x surgical system in the new product introductions section below). regulatory clearances for the da vinci x surgical system may be received in other markets over time.
the japanese ministry of health, labor, and welfare ("mhlw") considers reimbursement for procedures in april of even numbered years. the process for obtaining reimbursement requires japanese university hospitals and surgical societies, with our support, to seek reimbursement. there are multiple pathways to obtain reimbursement for procedures including those that require in-country clinical data/economic data. in april 2012 and april 2016, the mhlw granted reimbursement status for da vinci prostatectomy ("dvp") and partial nephrectomy, respectively. an additional 12 da vinci procedures were granted reimbursement effective april 1, 2018, including gastrectomy, low anterior resection, lobectomy and hysterectomy, for both malignant and benign conditions. these additional 12 reimbursed procedures have varying levels of conventional, laparoscopic penetration and will be reimbursed at rates equal to the conventional laparoscopic procedures. given the reimbursement level and laparoscopic penetration for these procedures, there can be no assurance that adoption will occur or, that the adoption pace for these procedures will be similar to any other da vinci procedure. if these procedures are not adopted and we are not successful in obtaining adequate procedure reimbursements for additional procedures, then the demand for our products in japan could be limited.
in the third quarter of 2018, we filed for u.s. fda clearance of our ion endoluminal system for obtaining lung biopsies (see the description of the ion endoluminal system in the new product introductions section below). there can be no assurance that we will receive u.s. fda clearance for this product.
recalls and corrections medical device companies have regulatory obligations to correct or remove medical devices in the field that could pose a risk to health. the definition of "recalls and corrections" is expansive and includes repair, replacement, inspections, relabeling, and issuance of new or additional instructions for use or reinforcement of existing instructions for use and training when such actions are taken for specific reasons of safety or compliance. these field actions require stringent documentation, reporting, and monitoring worldwide. there are other actions a medical device manufacturer may take in the field without reporting including, but not limited to, routine servicing and stock rotations.
as we determine whether a field action is reportable in any regulatory jurisdiction, we prepare and submit notifications to the appropriate regulatory agency for the particular jurisdiction. regulators can require the expansion, reclassification, or change in scope and language of the field action. in general, upon submitting required notifications to regulators regarding a field action which is a recall or correction, we will notify customers regarding the field action, provide any additional documentation required in their national language, and arrange, as required, return or replacement of the affected product or a field service visit to perform the correction.
field actions as well as certain outcomes from regulatory activities can result in adverse effects on our business, including damage to our reputation, delays by customers of purchase decisions, reduction or stoppage of the use of installed systems, and reduced revenue as well as increased expenses.
procedures we model patient value as equal to procedure efficacy / invasiveness. in this equation procedure efficacy is defined as a measure of the success of the surgery in resolving the underlying disease and invasiveness is defined as a measure of patient pain and disruption of regular activities. when the patient value of a da vinci procedure is greater than that of alternative treatment options, patients may benefit from seeking out surgeons and hospitals that offer robotic-assisted surgery with the da vinci surgical system. adoption of da vinci procedures occurs procedure by procedure, market by market, and is driven by the relative patient value and total treatment costs of da vinci procedures as compared with alternative treatment options for the same disease state or condition.
worldwide procedures our da vinci systems and instruments are regulated independently in various countries and regions of the world. the discussion of indications for use and representative or target procedures is intended solely to provide an understanding of the market for da vinci products and is not intended to promote for sale or use any intuitive surgical product outside of its licensed or cleared labeling and indications for use.
the adoption of robotic-assisted surgery using the da vinci surgical system has the potential to grow for those procedures that offer greater patient value than non-da vinci alternatives and competitive total economics for healthcare providers. our da vinci surgical systems are used primarily in general surgery, gynecologic surgery, urologic surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, and head and neck surgery. we focus our organization and investments on developing, marketing, and training products and services for procedures in which da vinci can bring patient value relative to alternative treatment options and/or economic benefit to healthcare providers. target procedures in general surgery include hernia repair (both ventral and inguinal) and colorectal procedures. target procedures in gynecology include da vinci hysterectomy ("dvh"), for both cancer and benign conditions, and sacrocolpopexy. target procedures in urology include prostatectomy ("dvp") and partial nephrectomy. in cardiothoracic surgery, target procedures include da vinci lobectomy and da vinci mitral valve repair. in head and neck surgery, target procedures include certain procedures resecting benign and malignant tumors classified as t1 and t2. not all the indications, procedures, or products described may be available in a given country or region or on all generations of da vinci surgical systems. surgeons and their patients need to consult the product labeling in their specific country and for each product in order to determine the cleared uses, as well as important limitations, restrictions, or contraindications.
in 2018, approximately 1,037,000 surgical procedures were performed with the da vinci surgical systems, compared with approximately 877,000 and 753,000 procedures performed in 2017 and 2016, respectively. the growth in our overall procedure volume in 2018 was driven by growth in u.s. general surgery procedures and worldwide urologic procedures.
u.s. procedures overall u.s. procedure volume grew to approximately 753,000 in 2018, compared with approximately 644,000 in 2017, and approximately 563,000 in 2016. general surgery was our largest and fastest growing u.s. specialty in 2018 with procedure volume that grew to approximately 325,000 in 2018, compared with approximately 246,000 in 2017 and 186,000 in 2016. gynecology was our second largest u.s. surgical specialty in 2018 with procedure volume of approximately 265,000 in 2018, compared with 252,000 in 2017 and 246,000 in 2016. u.s. urology procedure volume was approximately 128,000 in 2018, compared with approximately 118,000 in 2017 and 109,000 in 2016.
procedures outside of the u.s.
overall ous procedures grew to approximately 284,000 in 2018, compared with approximately 233,000 in 2017 and approximately 190,000 in 2016. procedure growth in most ous markets was driven largely by urology procedure volume, which grew to approximately 175,000 in 2018, compared with approximately 149,000 in 2017 and approximately 124,000 in 2016. general surgery and gynecologic oncology procedures also contributed to ous procedure growth.
recent business events and trends procedures overall. during the year ended december 31, 2018, total da vinci procedures grew approximately 18% compared with 16% for the year ended december 31, 2017. u.s. procedure growth during the year ended december 31, 2018, was approximately 17% compared with approximately 14% for the year ended december 31, 2017. the higher 2018 u.s. procedure growth was largely attributable to growth in general surgery procedures (most notably hernia repair, colorectal, cholecystectomy, and bariatric procedures) and thoracic procedures, as well as moderate growth in more mature gynecologic and urologic procedure categories.
procedure volume ous for the year ended december 31, 2018, grew approximately 22% compared with approximately 23% growth for the year ended december 31, 2017, driven by continued growth in dvp procedures and earlier stage growth in general surgery, gynecology, and kidney cancer procedures. we believe growth in these global markets is being driven by increased acceptance among surgeons and health systems, supported by expanded global evidence validating the clinical and economic value of da vinci procedures. the growth rate for 2018 was lower than the growth rate in the previous year primarily due to lower procedure growth in china. procedure growth in china moderated as da vinci system capacity expansion was constrained by system quota requirements, as the previous quota expired at the end of 2015 and the most recent quota was not issued until the fourth quarter of 2018 (see discussion of the china quota below under "ous procedures").
u.s. general surgery. in 2018, general surgery was our largest and fastest growing specialty in the u.s. with procedure volume that grew to approximately 325,000 in 2018, compared with approximately 246,000 in 2017, and 186,000 in 2016. ventral and inguinal hernia, combined, contributed to the most incremental growth in u.s. general surgery procedures in 2018 and 2017. we believe that growth in da vinci hernia repair reflects improved clinical outcomes within certain patient populations, as well as potential cost benefits relative to certain alternative treatments. we believe hernia repair procedures represent a significant opportunity with the potential to drive growth in future periods. however, given the differences in complexity among hernia patient populations and varying surgeon opinion regarding optimal surgical technique, it is difficult to estimate the timing of and to what extent da vinci hernia repair procedure volume will grow in the future. we expect a large portion of hernia repairs will continue to be performed via different modalities of surgery.
adoption of da vinci for colorectal procedures, which encompasses several underlying procedures including low anterior resections for rectal cancers and certain colon procedures for benign and cancerous conditions, has been ongoing for several years. this adoption is supported by our recently launched technologies such as the da vinci xi surgical system, endowrist stapler products, endowrist vessel sealer, and integrated table motion.
during 2018, we have seen increasing contributions to growth from other u.s. general surgery procedures, including cholecystectomy and bariatric procedures. our third quarter 2018 introduction of the sureform 60mm stapler product optimizes our robotic tool set for bariatric procedures. we introduced the sureform 60mm stapler at a measured pace during the second half of 2018 and we intend to broaden availability in 2019.
u.s. gynecology. in 2018, u.s. gynecology grew mid-single digits compared to 2017. procedure volume was approximately 265,000 in 2018, compared with 252,000 in 2017 and 246,000 in 2016. combining robotic, laparoscopic, and vaginal approaches, mis represents approximately 80% of the u.s. hysterectomy market for benign conditions. we believe that our growth in gynecologic procedures over the past several years has primarily been driven by consolidation of gynecologic procedures into higher volume surgeons that focus on cancer and complex surgeries.
global urology. along with u.s. general surgery, global urology procedures drove our recent procedure growth. in the u.s., dvp is the largest urology procedure. 2018 growth in u.s. dvp procedures moderated slightly compared with 2017. we believe our growth in u.s. dvp procedures is largely aligned with overall prostate cancer surgical volumes as dvp is a highly penetrated procedure. dvp is the largest overall ous procedure. 2018 growth in ous dvp was consistent with growth in 2017. adoption of dvp is at varying stages in our ous markets.
kidney cancer procedures have also been a strong contributor to our recent global urology procedure growth. clinical publications have demonstrated that the presence of a da vinci system in a hospital or market increases the likelihood that a patient will receive nephron sparing surgery through a partial nephrectomy, which typically conforms to surgical society guideline recommendations.
ous procedures. the 2018 ous procedure growth rate reflects continued da vinci adoption in european and asian markets. in china, we have experienced strong procedure utilization on systems sold under the previous public hospital quota. in 2018, procedure growth in china moderated as the previous quota expired at the end of 2015 and the 38 systems shipped under that quota reached high levels of utilization. in october 2018, the china national health commission announced a new quota to allow the sale of 154 new surgical robots into china through 2020, which could include da vinci surgical systems. this quota applies to the da vinci si and recently approved xi surgical systems (refer to the previous discussion in the "clearances and approvals" section), as well as competitors' products when and if cleared by nmpa. sales of da vinci surgical systems under the quota are uncertain, as they are dependent on hospitals completing a tender process and receiving associated approvals. in japan, we have experienced strong procedure growth since receiving national reimbursements for dvp and partial nephrectomy. however, as adoption for these procedures has progressed towards higher levels of penetration, growth in these two urologic procedures has moderated. reimbursement for dvp and partial nephrectomy were set at a premium to reimbursements for open procedures, which was the dominant treatment modality. a total of 12 additional da vinci procedures were granted national reimbursements status effective april 1, 2018, including gastrectomy, low anterior resection, lobectomy and hysterectomy, for both malignant and benign conditions. procedure growth has accelerated in japan since the new reimbursements became effective. however, these additional 12 procedures have reimbursement rates equal to conventional laparoscopic procedures, which are the dominant surgical approaches. given the reimbursement level and laparoscopic penetration for these procedures, there can be no assurance that adoption will occur or that the adoption pace for these procedures will be similar to other da vinci procedures. if these procedures are not adopted and we are not successful in obtaining adequate procedure reimbursement for additional procedures, then the demand for our products in japan could be limited.
system demand future demand for da vinci surgical systems will be impacted by factors including hospital response to the evolving health care environment under the current u.s. administration, procedure growth rates, hospital consolidation trends, evolving system utilization and point of care dynamics, capital replacement trends, additional reimbursements in various global markets, including japan, the timing around governmental tenders and authorizations, including china, the timing of when we receive regulatory clearance in our other ous markets for our da vinci xi surgical system, da vinci x surgical system, and da vinci sp surgical system, and related instruments, market response as well as other economic and geopolitical factors. market acceptance of our recently launched da vinci sp surgical system and the nature and timing of additional da vinci sp regulatory indications may also impact future system placements. demand may also be impacted by robotic surgery competition, including from companies that have introduced products in the field of robotic surgery or have made explicit statements about their efforts to enter the field including, but not limited to: auris health, inc.; avatera medical gmbh; cmr surgical limited; johnson & johnson and google inc. and their joint venture, verb surgical inc.; medicaroid inc.; medrobotics corp.; medtronic plc.; meerecompany inc.; olympus corp.; samsung corporation; smart robot technology group co. ltd.; titan medical, inc.; transenterix, inc.; and wego holding co., ltd.
new product introductions ion endoluminal system. in the third quarter of 2018, we filed for u.s. fda clearance of our ion endoluminal system for obtaining lung biopsies. ion is our new flexible robotic-assisted catheter-based platform, designed to navigate through very small airways to reach peripheral nodes for biopsies. there can be no assurance that we will receive the clearance we are seeking.
da vinci sp surgical system. in may 2018, we obtained u.s. fda clearance for the da vinci sp surgical system for urologic surgical procedures that are appropriate for a single port approach. the da vinci sp system includes three, multi-jointed, wristed instruments and the first da vinci fully wristed 3dhd camera. the instruments and the camera all emerge through a single cannula and are triangulated around the target anatomy to avoid external instrument collisions that can occur in narrow surgical workspaces. the system enables flexible port placement and broad internal and external range of motion (e.g. 360-degrees of anatomical access) through the single sp arm. surgeons control the fully articulating instruments and the camera on the da vinci sp system, which uses the same fourth generation surgeon console as the da vinci x and xi systems. the da vinci sp system provides surgeons with robotic-assisted technology designed for deep and narrow access to tissue in the body. we anticipate pursuing further regulatory clearances for the da vinci sp, including transoral and colorectal applications, broadening the applicability of the sp platform over time. we plan to launch the da vinci sp surgical system in a measured fashion, having shipped 15 sp surgical systems to customers during 2018.
da vinci x surgical system. in may 2017, we launched a new da vinci model, the da vinci x, in the u.s. the da vinci x system provides surgeons and hospitals with access to some of the most advanced fourth generation da vinci surgery technology at a lower cost. the da vinci x uses the same vision cart and surgeon console that are found on our flagship product, the da vinci xi system. for new customers, the da vinci x system provides a cost effective capital entry point while providing a pathway for upgrading to other fourth generation systems. existing customers may negotiate to trade in their older da vinci systems in order to standardize their robotics programs onto the fourth generation platform, and choosing which system model by considering clinical and economic factors.
the da vinci x enables optimized, focused-quadrant surgery including procedures like prostatectomy, hernia repair, and benign hysterectomy, among others. the system features flexible port placement and 3d digital optics, while incorporating the same advanced instruments and accessories as the da vinci xi. the new system drives operational efficiencies through set-up technology that uses voice and laser guidance, drape design that simplifies surgery preparations, and a lightweight, fully integrated endoscope.
sureform 60 and sureform 45 staplers. in july 2018, we received u.s. fda clearance in the u.s. for sureform 60 instrument with white, blue, green, and black 60mm reloads. in january 2019, we received u.s. fda clearance in the u.s. for sureform 45 instrument with white, blue, green, and black 45mm reloads. the sureform 60 and sureform 45 are single-use, fully wristed, stapling instruments intended for resection, transection, and/or creation of anastomoses. the sureform 60 has particular utility in bariatric procedures, while the sureform 45 has particular utility in colorectal procedures. sureform 60 and sureform 45 broaden our existing stapler product line, which also includes endowrist stapler 45 with white, blue, and green, 45mm reloads and endowrist 30 with white, blue, green, and gray 30mm reloads. not all reloads or staplers are available for use on all systems or in all countries.
da vinci vessel sealer extend. in april 2018, we received u.s. fda clearance for da vinci vessel sealer extend, our newest instrument in the vessel sealing family of products. da vinci vessel sealer extend is a single-use, fully wristed bipolar electrosurgical instrument compatible with our fourth generation multiport systems. it is intended for grasping and blunt dissection of tissue and for bipolar coagulation and mechanical transection of vessels up to 7mm in diameter and tissue bundles that fit in the jaws of the instrument.
intuitive surgical-fosun joint venture in september 2016, we agreed to establish the joint venture to research, develop, manufacture, and sell robotic-assisted catheter-based medical devices. the catheter-based technology will initially target early diagnosis and cost-effective treatment of lung cancer, one of the most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer in the world. the technology will be used in robotic-assisted medical devices based on catheters and incorporates proprietary intellectual property developed or owned by us. distribution of catheter-based medical devices in china will be conducted by the joint venture, while distribution outside of china will be conducted by us. the joint venture is located in china. in january 2019, the joint venture acquired these distribution rights along with certain other assets related to the distribution business of chindex, a wholly-owned subsidiary of fosun pharma, and began direct operations for da vinci products and services in china. the joint venture is owned 60% by us and 40% by fosun pharma. as of december 31, 2018, the companies have contributed $30 million of up to $100 million stipulated by the joint venture agreement. in 2018, the net loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest in the joint venture was $2.9 million.
we do not expect the joint venture to generate revenue in 2019 related to the sale of robotic-assisted catheter-based medical devices. there can be no assurance that we and the joint venture can successfully complete the development of the robotic-assisted catheter-based medical devices; or that we and the joint venture will successfully commercialize such products. there can also be no assurance that the joint venture will not require additional contributions to fund its business; that the joint venture will become profitable; or that the acquired chindex assets will be successfully integrated and the expected benefits realized.

total revenue total revenue increased by 19% to $3.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018, compared with $3.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017. total revenue for the year ended december 31, 2017, increased by 16% compared with $2.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase in total revenue for the year ended december 31, 2018, reflects 20% higher instrument and accessory revenue driven by approximately 18% higher procedure volume, 21% higher systems revenue, and 11% higher service revenue. the increase in total revenue for the year ended december 31, 2017, reflects 17% higher instrument and accessory revenue driven by approximately 16% higher procedure volume, 16% higher systems revenue, and 12% higher service revenue.
revenue denominated in foreign currencies was approximately 20%, 17%, and 19% of total revenue for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. we sell our products and services in local currencies where we have direct distribution channels. foreign currency rate fluctuations did not have a material impact on total revenue for the year ended december 31, 2018, as compared with 2017, or for the year ended december 31, 2017, as compared with 2016.
revenue generated in the u.s. accounted for 71%, 73%, and 72% of total revenue during the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. we believe that u.s. revenue has accounted for the large majority of total revenue due to patients' ability to choose their provider and method of treatment in the u.s., reimbursement structures supportive of innovation and minimally invasive surgery, and initial investments focused on our u.s. infrastructure. we have been investing in our business in the ous market and our ous procedures have grown faster in proportion to u.s. procedures. we expect that our ous procedures and revenue will make up a greater portion of our business in the long term.
the following table summarizes our revenue and da vinci surgical system unit shipments for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively (in millions, except percentages and unit shipments):

unit shipments involving system trade-ins:
instrument and accessory revenue increased by 20% to $2.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018, compared with $1.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase in instrument and accessory revenue was driven by procedure growth of approximately 18% and higher sales of our advanced instruments, partially offset by procedure mix. u.s. procedure growth in 2018 was approximately 17% compared with 14% in 2017 and was driven by growth in general surgery procedures, most notably hernia repair and colorectal procedures; thoracic procedures; and a moderate growth in the more mature gynecologic and urologic procedure categories. ous procedure growth in 2018 was approximately 22% compared with 23% in 2017. key drivers for ous procedure growth in both years reflected growth in dvp procedures and earlier stage growth in kidney cancer procedures, general surgery, and gynecology. geographically, ous procedure growth has been driven by procedure expansion in japan, china, and south korea. procedure growth varied by country in our european market.
systems revenue increased by 21% to $1,127.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, compared with $928.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. higher systems revenue was primarily driven by higher system shipments, partly offset by a higher number of system placements under operating lease arrangements.
during 2018, a total of 926 systems were shipped compared with 684 systems in 2017. by geography, 581 systems were shipped into the u.s., 169 into europe, 116 into asia, and 60 into other markets, compared with 417 systems shipped into the u.s., 122 into europe, 108 into asia, and 37 into other markets in 2017. during 2018, 229 of the 926 systems were shipped under operating lease arrangements compared with 108 of 684 systems shipped during 2017. the increase in system shipments was primarily driven by procedure growth and the need for hospitals to expand or establish capacity. higher 2018 capital replacement shipments also contributed to overall 2018 system growth as 277 of 926 systems placed in 2018 involved trade-ins of older models, compared to 163 of 684 systems in 2017.
operating lease revenue was $51.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, compared with $25.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. revenue from lease buyouts was $48.8 million for year ended december 31, 2018, compared with $39.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2017.
the asp for da vinci surgical systems sold, which excludes operating lease and lease buyout revenue, was approximately $1.45 million and $1.47 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively. asps fluctuate period to period based on geographic and product mix, product pricing, systems shipped involving trade-ins, and changes in foreign exchange rates.
instrument and accessory revenue increased by 17% to $1.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared with $1.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase in instrument and accessory revenue was driven by procedure growth of approximately 16% and higher sales of our advanced instruments, partially offset by customer efficiency gains and timing of orders. u.s. procedure growth in 2017 was approximately 14% compared with 13% in 2016 and was driven by growth in general surgery procedures, most notably hernia repair and colorectal procedures; thoracic procedures and a moderate growth in the more mature gynecologic and urologic procedure categories. ous procedure growth was approximately 23% for 2017, compared with 24% for 2016, driven by continued growth in dvp procedures, earlier stage growth in kidney cancer procedures, general surgery, and gynecology. geographically, ous procedure growth for the year ended december 31, 2017, was driven by strong procedure expansion in japan, china, and south korea. procedure growth varied by country in our european market.
systems revenue increased by 16% to $928.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2017, compared with $800.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2016. higher systems revenue was primarily driven by higher system shipments and partly offset by a higher number of system placements under operating lease arrangements and lower da vinci surgical system asp.
during 2017, a total of 684 systems were shipped compared with 537 systems in 2016. by geography, 417 systems were shipped into the u.s., 108 into asia, 122 to europe, and 37 into other markets, compared with 338 systems shipped into the u.s., 96 into asia, 79 into europe, and 24 into other markets in 2016. during 2017, 108 of the 684 systems were shipped under operating lease arrangements compared with 62 of 537 systems shipped during 2016. the increase in system shipments was primarily driven by procedure growth and the need for hospitals to establish or expand capacity.
the asp for da vinci surgical systems sold, which excludes operating lease and lease buyout revenue, was approximately $1.47 million and $1.52 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. the lower 2017 asp was driven by a higher proportion of systems sales into price sensitive market segments. asps fluctuate period to period based on geographic and product mix, product pricing, systems shipped involving trade-ins, and changes in foreign exchange rates.
service revenue service revenue increased by 11% to $635.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, compared with $572.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. service revenue increased by 12% to $572.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared with $510.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. higher service revenue in 2018 and 2017 was primarily driven by a larger installed base of da vinci surgical systems producing service revenue.
gross profit product gross profit increased by 21% for the year ended december 31, 2018, to $2.2 billion, representing 70.7% of product revenue, compared with $1.8 billion, representing 70.5% of product revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2017. the higher 2018 product gross profit was primarily driven by higher product revenue.
product gross profit margin for the year ended december 31, 2018, was consistent with the year ended december 31, 2017, as higher costs associated with new product introductions were largely offset by manufacturing efficiencies and product cost reductions.
product gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2017, increased by 18% to $1.8 billion, or 70.5% of product revenue, compared with $1.5 billion, or 69.8% of product revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2016. the slightly higher 2017 product gross profit was due to manufacturing efficiencies and product cost reductions on some of our newer products, partially offset by a $7.8 million litigation settlement charge related to a license and supply agreement recognized in cost of revenue during the first quarter of 2017, and a $7.1 million mdet refund in 2016. in december 2015, the consolidated appropriations act, 2016 (the "appropriations act") was signed into law. the appropriations act included a two-year moratorium on mdet such that medical device sales in 2016 and 2017 were exempt from the excise tax. new legislation was passed in january 2018 such that mdet will be delayed in until january 1, 2020.
product gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, included share-based compensation expense of $36.4 million, $28.1 million, and $25.2 million, respectively, and amortization expense of intangible assets of $6.1 million, $5.4 million, and $7.8 million, respectively.
service gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2018, increased to $421.2 million, or 66.3% of service revenue, compared with $393.0 million, or 68.6% of service revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2017. the higher 2018 service gross profit was driven by higher service revenue, reflecting a larger installed base of da vinci surgical systems, partially offset by lower service gross profit margin. the lower service gross profit margin for the year ended december 31, 2018 was driven by higher costs associated with the repair and replacement of da vinci xi/x endoscope products.
service gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2017, increased to $393.0 million, or 68.6% of service revenue, compared with $359.7 million, or 70.4% of service revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2016. the higher 2017 service gross profit was driven by higher service revenue, reflecting a large installed base of da vinci surgical systems, partially offset by lower service gross profit margin. the lower service gross profit margin for the year ended december 31, 2017, was primarily driven by higher costs associated with the repair of da vinci xi endoscope products.
service gross profit for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, included share-based compensation expense of $16.8 million, $14.0 million, and $12.4 million, respectively.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses include costs for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, sales and marketing activities, tradeshow expenses, legal expenses, regulatory fees, and general corporate expenses.
selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2018, increased by 22% to $986.6 million, compared with $810.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. the higher selling, general and administrative expenses in 2018 were primarily associated with expansion of our asian and european teams, infrastructure to support our growing operations, litigation charges, increased headcount in our u.s. commercial teams to support our growth, and the establishment of the intuitive foundation. in 2018, we made a charitable contribution of $25.2 million to establish the intuitive foundation, a section 501(c)(3) qualifying not-for-profit entity whose mission is to reduce the global burden of disease and suffering through research, education, and philanthropy aimed at better outcomes for patients around the globe.
selling, general and administrative expenses included pre-tax litigation charges of $45.2 million and $17.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, and 2017, respectively. the litigation charge for the year ended december 31, 2018, was primarily related to the settlement of the abrams class action lawsuit further described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8.
selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2017, increased by 15% to $810.5 million compared with $703.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was primarily due to higher variable compensation costs, higher ous expenses associated with our expanded asian and european teams, infrastructure to support our growth, higher headcount, and higher litigation charges. selling, general and administrative expenses also included pre-tax litigation charges of $17.5 million and $12.1 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, and 2016 respectively.
research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred. research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing, and significant enhancement of our products.
research and development expenses for the year ended december 31, 2018, increased by 27% to $418.1 million, compared with $328.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase was primarily due to higher personnel and other project costs to support a broader set of product development initiatives, including our robotic-assisted catheter-based medical devices; advanced imaging and analytics; advanced instrumentation; future generations of robotics; and expenses related to licensed intellectual property.
research and development expenses for the year ended december 31, 2017, increased by 37% to $328.6 million compared with $239.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was primarily due to higher personnel and other project costs to support a broader set of product development initiatives, including da vinci platform products; da vinci single port surgical system; our robotic-assisted catheter-based medical devices; advanced imaging and analytics; advanced instrumentation; future generation of robotics; and expense related to licensed intellectual property.
share-based compensation expense charged to research and development expense during the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, was $76.2 million, $56.0 million, and $43.0 million, respectively. amortization expense related to intangible assets for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, was $5.8 million, $7.5 million, and $10.4 million, respectively.
research and development expenses fluctuate with project timing. based upon our broader set of product development initiatives and the stage of the underlying projects, we expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to increase in the future.
income tax expense our income tax expense was $154.5 million, $433.9 million, and $247.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. the effective tax rate for 2018 was approximately 12.1% compared with 39.3% for 2017, and 25.1% for 2016. our effective tax rate for 2018 differs from the u.s. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the excess tax benefits recognized for employee share-based compensation, the effect of income earned by certain overseas entities being taxed at rates lower than the federal statutory rate, federal research and development credit benefit, and the release of unrecognized tax benefits from expiration of statutes of limitations, partially offset by state income taxes (net of federal benefit) and u.s. tax on foreign earnings.
our tax rate for 2017 reflected the effect of the below mentioned one-time discrete items associated with the enactment of the 2017 tax act. besides the impact of the 2017 tax act, our tax rates for 2017 and 2016 differ from the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% also due to the effect of income earned by certain overseas entities being taxed at rates lower than the federal statutory rate and reversal of certain unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by state income taxes (net of federal benefit). our 2018, 2017, and 2016 tax provision reflected tax benefits of $5.2 million, $62.4 million, and $15.8 million, respectively associated with the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits and interests resulting from expiration of statutes of limitations in multiple jurisdictions and certain audit settlements.
on december 22, 2017, the u.s. federal government enacted the 2017 tax act. the 2017 tax act includes a number of changes in existing tax law impacting businesses, including a one-time deemed repatriation of cumulative undistributed foreign earnings and a permanent reduction in the u.s. federal statutory rate from 35% to 21%, effective on january 1, 2018. under u.s. gaap, changes in tax rates and tax law are accounted for in the period of enactment and deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the enacted tax rate. consistent with guidance issued by the securities exchange commission ("sec"), which provides for a measurement period of one year from the enactment date to finalize the accounting for effects of the 2017 tax act, we estimated an income tax expense of $317.8 million related to the 2017 tax act, $270.2 million of which related to the one-time deemed repatriation toll charge ("toll tax"), and $47.6 million related to the re-measurement of our net deferred tax assets at the reduced u.s. federal statutory rate of 21%.
in december 2018, we completed our accounting for the effect of the 2017 tax act within the measurement period under the sec guidance, and reflected a $0.5 million net increase in the 2018 income tax expense. we have adopted the approach of recording the consequences of the global intangible low-taxed income provision of the 2017 tax act as period costs when incurred. in addition, we repatriated $1.6 billion of our cumulative undistributed foreign earnings back to the u.s. in june 2018 without any significant u.s. income tax consequences. we intend to repatriate earnings from our swiss subsidiary as needed since the u.s.
and foreign tax implications of such repatriations are not expected to be significant. we will continue to indefinitely reinvest earnings from the rest of our foreign subsidiaries, which are not significant.
asu no. 2016-09, improvements to employee share-based payment accounting, changes how the tax effects of share-based awards are recognized and requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies associated with employee equity to be recognized in the provision for income taxes as discrete items in the period when the awards vest or are settled, whereas previously such income tax effects were recorded as part of additional paid-in capital. our 2018 and 2017 provisions for income taxes included excess tax benefits associated with employee equity plans of $116.2 million and $102.8 million, respectively, which reduced our effective tax rate by 9.1 and 9.3 percentage points, respectively, for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017. the amount of excess tax benefits or deficiencies will fluctuate from period to period based on the price of our stock, the volume of share-based instruments settled or vested, and the value assigned to employee equity awards under u.s. gaap, and will result in increased income tax expense volatility.
our 2007 swiss tax holiday ended on december 31, 2017 and we received a new swiss tax ruling for new business operations in switzerland. the new tax ruling is effective for years 2018 through 2022, which will be extended for the next five years thereafter, to the extent certain terms and conditions continue to be met. the new ruling allows for a reduced cantonal tax rate based on various thresholds of investment, including the ownership, development, and use of non-u.s. intellectual property rights and employment in such jurisdiction. we currently do not expect that the change to the new ruling will materially impact our future annual swiss income tax expense.
we file federal, state, and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the u.s. and abroad. years prior to 2015 are considered closed for most significant jurisdictions. certain of our unrecognized tax benefits could reverse based on the normal expiration of various statutes of limitations, which could affect our effective tax rate in the period in which they reverse.
we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities. the outcome of these audits cannot be predicted with certainty. management regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. if any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash our principal source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and issuance of common stock through exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase program. cash and cash equivalents plus short- and long-term investments increased by $1.0 billion to $4.8 billion as of december 31, 2018, from $3.8 billion as of december 31, 2017, primarily as a result of cash provided by our operations and employee stock option exercises. cash and cash equivalents plus short- and long-term investments decreased by $1.0 billion to $3.8 billion as of december 31, 2017, from $4.8 billion as of december 31, 2016, primarily as a result of the $2.3 billion accelerated share buyback program executed and settled during 2017, partly offset by cash provided by our operations and employee stock option exercises. cash generation is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting our operating, investing, and financing needs.
as of december 31, 2018, $225.8 million of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries, which decreased from $1.5 billion as of december 31, 2017, primarily due to the repatriation of $1.4 billion of foreign subsidiaries' cash, cash equivalents, and investments in the second quarter of 2018. we intend to repatriate earnings from our swiss subsidiary as needed since the u.s. and foreign tax implications of such repatriations are not expected to be significant. we will continue to indefinitely reinvest earnings from the rest of our foreign subsidiaries, which are not significant. we believe the cash provided by our operations will meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.

operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2018, cash provided by our operating activities of $1,169.6 million exceeded our net income of $1,125.0 million due to non-cash charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities as outlined below:
1.   our net income included non-cash charges: share-based compensation of $261.2 million; depreciation and loss on disposal of property, plant, and equipment of $108.6 million; deferred income taxes of $31.9 million; amortization of intangible assets of $14.2 million; amortization of contract acquisition asset of $10.6 million; and investment related non-cash charges of $1.8 million.
2.   changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in $383.7 million of cash used in operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2018. operating assets and liabilities are primarily comprised of accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses and other assets, accrued compensation and employee benefits, deferred revenue, and other accrued liabilities. inventory, including the transfer of equipment from inventory to property, plant, and equipment, increased by $279.0 million primarily due to more systems under operating lease arrangements and an increase in inventory to meet higher sales volumes and add safety stock to mitigate possible trade and supplier matters. accounts receivable increased by $161.3 million primarily due to higher customer billings and timing of billings and collections. prepaid expenses and other assets increased by $77.7 million. the unfavorable impact of these items on cash used by operating activities was partly offset by a $54.3 million increase in deferred revenue, a $37.1 million increase in other accrued liabilities, and a $26.2 million increase in accrued compensation and employee benefits.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, cash provided by our operating activities of $1,143.9 million exceeded our net income of $670.9 million due to non-cash charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities as outlined below:
1.   our net income included non-cash charges, including share-based compensation of $209.1 million, depreciation and loss of disposal of property, plant, and equipment of $86.2 million, deferred income taxes of $60.2 million, investment related non-cash charges of $21.2 million, and amortization of intangible assets of $12.9 million.
2.   changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in $73.5 million of cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2017. operating assets and liabilities are primarily comprised of accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses and other assets, deferred revenue, and other accrued liabilities. other accrued liabilities increased by $219.4 million, primarily due to an increase in income tax payable as a result of the 2017 tax act. deferred revenue, which includes deferred service revenue that is being recognized as revenue over the service contract period, increased by $43.7 million primarily due to the higher number of installed systems for which service contracts existed. accrued compensation and employee benefits increased by $31.2 million. accounts payable increased by $14.0 million. the favorable impact of these items on cash provided by operating activities was partly offset by an increase of $115.5 million in inventory, including the transfer of equipment from inventory to property, plant, and equipment; an increase of $81.4 million in accounts receivable; and an increase of $38.9 million in prepaids and other assets. the increase in accounts receivable was primarily driven by higher revenue and timing of collections. the increase in prepaids and other assets was primarily driven by higher lease receivable balances resulting from sales-type lease arrangement transactions entered into during the year ended december 31, 2017.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, cash provided by our operating activities of $1,087.0 million exceeded our net income of $735.9 million primarily due certain to non-cash charges as outlined below:
1.   our net income included non-cash charges including in the form of share-based compensation of $177.6 million; depreciation and loss of disposal of property, plant, and equipment of $73.9 million; investment related non-cash charges of $35.9 million; deferred income tax of $20.9 million; and amortization of intangible assets of $18.2 million.
2.   the non-cash charges outlined above were partly offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in $17.7 million of cash used by operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2016. operating assets and liabilities are primarily comprised of accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses, deferred revenue, and other accrued liabilities. inventory, including the transfer of equipment from inventory to property, plant and equipment, increased by $46.7 million. accounts receivable increased $34.2 million primarily driven by higher revenue and timing of collections. prepaids and other assets increased $39.2 million primarily driven by higher lease receivable balances resulting from sales-type lease arrangement transactions entered into during year ended december 31, 2016. the unfavorable impact of these items on cash provided by operating activities was partly offset by a $53.7 million increase in other liabilities, primarily due to higher income tax payable, a $14.1 million increase in deferred revenue, an $18.7 million increase in accrued compensation and employee benefits, and a $15.9 million increase in accounts payable. deferred revenue, which includes deferred service revenue that is being recognized as revenue over the service contract period, increased primarily due to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts existed.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2018, consisted of purchases of investments (net of the proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments) of $774.3 million, the purchases of property, plant, and equipment of $187.4 million, and acquisition of businesses for $87.9 million.
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2017, consisted of proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments (net of purchases of investments) of $569.4 million partly offset by purchases of property, plant, and equipment of $190.7 million.
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2016, consisted of purchases of investments (net of the proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments) of $1.2 billion and purchases of property, plant, and equipment for $53.9 million.
we invest predominantly in high quality, fixed income securities. our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in u.s. treasury and u.s. government agency securities, taxable and tax exempt municipal notes, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, non-u.s. government agency securities, cash deposits, and money market funds.
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities during 2018 primarily consisted of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $236.6 million, partly offset by taxes paid on behalf of employees related to net share settlement of vested employee equity awards of $120.0 million.
net cash used in financing activities during 2017 primarily consisted of $2,274.0 million related to an accelerated share buyback program executed and settled during 2017 and taxes paid on behalf of employees related to net share settlement of vested employee equity awards of $56.6 million. these uses were partly offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $415.5 million.
net cash provided by financing activities in 2016 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $580.9 million, partly offset by $42.5 million used for the repurchase of 0.2 million shares of our common stock through open market transactions and taxes paid on behalf of employees related to net share settlement of vested employee equity awards of $24.0 million.
our business has not been capital intensive. however, with the growth of our business and our investments in property and facilities and in manufacturing automation, capital investments have increased. we expect capital investments to exceed $250 million in each of the next two years. we intend to fund these needs with cash generated from operations.
our cash requirements depend on numerous factors, including market acceptance of our products, the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products, and other factors. we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to expand procedure adoption and acceptance of our products. we have made substantial investments in our commercial operations, product development activities, facilities, and intellectual property. based upon our business model, we anticipate that we will continue to be able to fund future growth through cash provided from operations. we believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, and investment balances, together with income to be derived from the sale of our products, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements beyond one year and for the foreseeable future.
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31, 2018 (in millions):
payments due by period total             less than1 year             1 to 3 years             3 to 5 years           more than 5 years operating leases                             $95.4                   $15.1                     $27.2                    $22.2                      $30.9
operating leases. we lease spaces for operations in the u.s. as well as in japan, south korea, mexico, and other foreign countries. we also lease automobiles for certain sales and field service employees. operating lease amounts include future minimum lease payments under all our non-cancellable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year.
purchase commitments and obligations. these amounts include an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, including commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services and acquisition and licensing of intellectual property. a majority of these purchase obligations are due within a year. although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. in addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration and development arrangements. payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and have not been included in the table above.
other. we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when payments may occur for our unrecognized tax benefits. therefore, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is not included in the table above. as of december 31, 2018, our obligation associated with the deemed repatriation toll charge is $246.7 million, which is expected to be paid in installments.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2018, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of sec regulation s-k promulgated under the exchange act.
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("u.s. gaap"), which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions. see "note 2. summary of significant accounting policies," in notes to the consolidated financial statements, which is included in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data," which describes our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. the methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. our most critical accounting estimates include:
•   the valuation and recognition of investments, which impacts our investment portfolio balance when we assess fair value, and interest and other income, net, when we record impairments;
•   the standalone selling prices used to allocate the contract consideration to the individual performance obligations, which impacts revenue recognition;
•   the allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts, which impacts revenue;
•   the estimation of transactions to hedge, which impacts revenue and expense;
•   the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross profit margins;
•   the valuation of and assessment of recoverability of intangible assets and their estimated useful lives, which primarily impacts gross profit margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their amortization;
•   the valuation and recognition of share-based compensation, which impacts gross profit margin and operating expenses;
•   the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes; and
•   the estimate of probable loss associated with legal contingencies, which impacts accrued liabilities and operating expenses.
investments valuation fair value. our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in u.s. treasuries and u.s. government agency securities, non-u.s. government securities, taxable and/or tax exempt municipal notes, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, cash deposits, and money market funds. the assessment of the fair value of investments can be difficult and subjective. u.s. gaap establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value. valuation of level 1 and 2 instruments generally do not require significant management judgment and the estimation is not difficult. level 3 instruments include unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. the determination of fair value for level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity. there were no level 3 securities for the periods presented.
other-than-temporary impairment. after determining the fair value of our available-for-sale instruments, gains or losses on these securities are recorded to other comprehensive income ("oci"), until either the security is sold or we determine that the decline in value is other-than-temporary. the primary differentiating factors we considered in classifying impairments as either temporary or other-than-temporary impairments are our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, the length of the time and the extent to which the market value of the investment has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. these judgments could prove to be wrong, and companies with relatively high credit ratings and solid financial conditions may not be able to fulfill their obligations.
no significant impairment charges were recorded during the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. as of december 31, 2018, and 2017, net unrealized losses on investments of $9.8 million and $11.3 million, net of tax, respectively, were included in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
revenue recognition. our system sale arrangements contain multiple products and services, including system(s), system components, system accessories, instruments, accessories, and service. other than service, we generally deliver all of the products upfront. each of these products and services is a distinct performance obligation. system accessories, instruments, accessories, and service are also sold on a standalone basis.
for multiple-element arrangements, revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. standalone selling prices are based on observable prices at which we separately sell the products or services. if a standalone selling price is not directly observable, then we estimate the standalone selling prices considering market conditions and entity-specific factors including, but not limited to, features and functionality of the products and services, geographies, type of customer, and market conditions. we regularly review standalone selling prices and maintain internal controls over establishing and updating these estimates.
our system sales arrangements generally include a five-year period of service. the first year of service is generally free and included in the system sale arrangement and the remaining four years are at a stated service price. revenue that is allocated to service obligation is deferred and recognized ratably over the service period.
allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts. we record estimated reductions in revenue for potential returns of certain products by customers and other allowances. as a result, management must make estimates of potential future product returns and other allowances related to current period product revenue. in making such estimates, management analyzes historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products. if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates, material differences in the amount of reported revenue could result.
similarly, we make estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable, especially analyzing the aging and nature of accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends, and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. credit evaluations are undertaken for all major sales transactions before shipment is authorized. on a quarterly basis, we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging report and provide an allowance in an amount we deem adequate for doubtful accounts. if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates, material differences in the amount of our reported operating expenses could result.
hedge accounting for derivatives. we utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency denominated sales transactions and expenses. when specific criteria required by relevant accounting standards have been met, changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in oci rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. by their nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. when we determine that the transactions are no longer probable within a certain time-frame, we are required to reclassify the cumulative changes in the fair values of the related hedge contracts from oci to net income.
inventory valuation. inventory is stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates actual costs, or net realizable value, on a first-in, first-out basis. the cost basis of our inventory is reduced for any products that are considered excessive or obsolete based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.
intangible assets. our intangible assets include identifiable intangibles and goodwill. identifiable intangibles include developed technology, patents, distribution rights, customer relationships, licenses, and non-competition arrangements. all of our identifiable intangibles have finite lives. goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to an annual impairment review (or more frequent if impairment indicators arise) by applying a fair value based test. there have been no such impairments.
identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are subject to impairment testing and are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of these identifiable intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from such assets. if the cash flow estimates or the significant operating assumptions upon which they are based change in the future, we may be required to record additional impairment charges.
the valuation and classification of intangible assets and goodwill and the assignment of useful lives for purposes of amortization involves judgments and the use of estimates. the evaluation of these intangibles and goodwill for impairment under established accounting guidelines is required on a recurring basis. changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to the assumptions made. when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of amortization over the assets' new, shorter useful lives. no impairment charge or accelerated amortization was recorded for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing impairment, which includes financial forecasts. if conditions are different from management's current estimates, material write-downs of long-lived assets may be required, which would adversely affect our operating results.
business combinations. we allocate the fair value of the purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. when determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. the estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows, and the determination of the assets' life cycle. these estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made.
accounting for stock options. we account for share-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of u.s. gaap. we use the black-scholes-merton option-pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term, and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements. the assumptions for expected volatility and expected term are the two assumptions that most significantly affect the grant date fair value of stock options. changes in expected risk-free rate of return do not significantly impact the calculation of fair value, and determining this input is not highly subjective.
we use implied volatility based on freely traded options in the open market, as we believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility. in determining the appropriateness of relying on implied volatility, we considered the following:
•   the sufficiency of the trading volume of freely traded options;
•   the ability to reasonably match the terms, such as the date of the grant and the exercise price of the freely traded options to options granted; and
•   the length of the term of the freely traded options used to derive implied volatility.
the expected term represents the weighted-average period that our stock options are expected to be outstanding. the expected term is based on the observed and expected time to exercise. we determine expected term based on historical exercise patterns and our expectation of the time it will take for employees to exercise options still outstanding.
we develop an estimate of the number of share-based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover. adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on our reported share-based compensation, as we recognize the cumulative effect of the rate adjustments for all expense amortization in the period the estimated forfeiture rates were adjusted. we estimate and adjust forfeiture rates based on a periodic review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover. if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than previously estimated forfeiture rate, we may make an adjustment that will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements during the period when the rate was changed. adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates could also cause changes in the amount of expense that we recognize in future periods.
changes in these subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock options and, consequently, the related amount of share-based compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statements of income.
accounting for income taxes. significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in accordance with u.s. gaap. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in the current or subsequent period.
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. in the event that all or part of our deferred tax assets are not recoverable in the future, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be recoverable. in order for our deferred tax assets to be recoverable, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. we consider forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, in determining the need for a valuation allowance. as of december 31, 2018, we believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets ultimately will be recovered with the exception of our california deferred tax assets. we believe that due to the computation of california taxes under the single sales factor, it is more likely than not that our california deferred tax assets will not be realized. should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would be affected in the period in which such change takes place.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, then the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. we re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effective settlement of audit issues, and new audit activity. such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
accounting for legal contingencies. we are involved in a number of legal proceedings involving product liability, intellectual property, shareholder derivative actions, securities class actions, insurance, employee related, and other matters. we record a liability and related charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements for legal contingencies when the loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. our assessment is re-evaluated each accounting period and is based on all available information, including discussion with any outside legal counsel that represents us. if a reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss cannot be made, but a range of probable losses can be estimated, the low-end of the range of losses is recognized if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other. if a loss is reasonably possible, but not probable and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
when determining the estimated probable loss or range of losses, significant judgment is required to be exercised in order to estimate the amount and timing of the loss to be recorded. estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation are inherently difficult to make, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages with incomplete facts and information. the final outcome of legal proceedings is dependent on many variables difficult to predict, and therefore, the ultimate cost to entirely resolve such matters may be materially different than the amount of current estimates. consequently, new information or changes in judgments and estimates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations or cash flows.

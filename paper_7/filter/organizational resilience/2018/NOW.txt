item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing under "consolidated financial statements and supplementary data" in item 8 of this filing. some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this filing, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. you should carefully read the "risk factors" section of this filing for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results and the timing of certain events to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
our billings and free cash flow measures included in the sections entitled "-key business metrics-billings," and "-key business metrics-free cash flow" are not in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). these non-gaap financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap. these measures may be different from non-gaap financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. we encourage investors to carefully consider our results under gaap, as well as our supplemental non-gaap results, to more fully understand our business.
overview servicenow, the company that makes work, work better for people, is a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing services that define, structure, manage and automate digital workflows for global enterprises. we deliver digital workflows that help our customers create great experiences and unlock productivity. we typically deliver our software via the internet as a service, through an easy-to-use, consumer product-like interface, which means it can be easily configured and rapidly deployed. in a minority of cases, customers deploy our software internally or contract with a third party to host the software to support their unique regulatory or security requirements.
we generally offer our services on an annual subscription fee basis, which includes access to the ordered subscription service and related support, including updates to the subscription service during the subscription term. pricing for our subscription services is based on a number of factors, including duration of subscription term, volume, mix of products purchased, and discounts. we generate sales through our direct sales team and, to a lesser extent, indirectly through resale partners and third-party referrals. we also generate revenues from professional services and for training of customer and partner personnel. we generally bill our customers annually in advance for subscription services and monthly in arrears for our professional services as the work is performed.
a majority of our revenues come from large global enterprise customers. we continue to invest in the development of our services, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth. we increased our overall employee headcount to 8,154 as of december 31, 2018 from 6,222 as of december 31, 2017.
key business metrics number of customers with acv greater than $1 million. we count the total number of customers with annualized contract value (acv) greater than $1 million as of the end of the period. we had 678, 508, and 354 customers with acv greater than $1 million as of december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. for purposes of customer count, a customer is defined as an entity with a unique dunn & bradstreet global ultimate (gult), data universal numbering system (duns) number and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date. the duns number is a global standard for business identification and tracking. we make exceptions for holding companies, government entities and other organizations for which the gult, in our judgment, does not accurately represent the servicenow customer. for example, while all u.s. government agencies roll up to "government of the united states" under the gult, we count each government agency that we contract with as a separate customer. our customer count is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, spin-offs and other market activity. previously disclosed number of customers with acv greater than $1 million as well as our average contract term calculations are restated to allow for comparability. acv is calculated based on the foreign exchange rate in effect at the time the contract was signed. foreign exchange rate fluctuations could cause some variability in the number of customers with acv greater than $1 million.
renewal rate. we calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100%. our attrition rate for a period is equal to the acv from customers lost during the period, divided by the sum of (i) the total acv from all customers that renewed during the period, excluding changes in price or users, and (ii) the total acv from all customers lost during the period. accordingly, our renewal rate is calculated based on acv and is not based on the number of customers that have renewed. further, our renewal rate does not reflect increased or decreased purchases from our customers to the extent such customers are not lost customers. a lost customer is a customer that did not renew an expiring contract and that, in our judgment, will not be renewed. typically, a customer that reduces its subscription upon renewal is not considered a lost customer. however, in instances where the subscription decrease represents the majority of the customer's acv, we may deem the renewal as a lost customer. for our renewal rate calculation, we define a customer as an entity with a separate production instance of our service and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date, instead of an entity with a unique gult or duns number. we adjust our renewal rate for acquisitions, consolidations and other customer events that cause the merging of two or more accounts occurring at the time of renewal. previously disclosed renewal rates may be restated to reflect such adjustments to allow for comparability. our renewal rate was 98%, for each of the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2016, and 97% for the year ended december 31, 2017. as our renewal rate is impacted by the timing of renewals, which could occur in advance of, or subsequent to the original contract end date, period-to-period comparison of renewal rates may not be meaningful.
total backlog. total backlog consists of unbilled backlog, deferred revenue and customer deposits. unbilled backlog is an operational measure representing future unearned revenue amounts believed to be firm that are to be invoiced under our existing agreements and are not included in the deferred revenue or customer deposits on our consolidated balance sheets. in our previous annual reports on form 10-k, we referred to unbilled backlog as "backlog." we believe total backlog is a useful measure of customer adoption of our services.
as of december 31, 2018, our total backlog was $5.1 billion, of which $3.4 billion was unbilled backlog and $1.7 billion was deferred revenue and customer deposits. of this total backlog, we expect to recognize approximately 50% in revenues over the 12 months following december 31, 2018, with the balance to be recognized thereafter.
as of december 31, 2017, our total backlog was $3.8 billion, of which $2.5 billion was unbilled backlog and $1.7 billion was deferred revenue and customer deposits, which reflects the impact of the full retrospective adoption of topic 606. for the disclosure of unbilled backlog prior to the adoption of topic 606, see the section entitled "business" in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2017 filed on february 28, 2018.
we expect total backlog to fluctuate due to a number of factors, including the timing, duration and size of customer contracts, the mix of cloud and self-hosted offerings and foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
billings. we define billings, a non-gaap financial measure, as revenues recognized plus the change in total unbilled receivables, deferred revenue and customer deposits as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows. prior to adopting topic 606 on january 1, 2018, we had defined billings in previous filings as revenues recognized plus the change in total deferred revenue as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows. our current definition better aligns with topic 606, which became effective for our interim and annual periods beginning january 1, 2018. refer to note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding topic 606.
a calculation of billings is provided below:
change in deferred revenue, unbilled receivables and customer deposits(1)         480,019                   381,160               283,568
year-over-year percentage change in total billings                                     34    %   37                      %        nm
*as adjusted to reflect the impact of the full retrospective adoption of topic 606. see note 2 for further details.
nm - not meaningful. year-over-year percentage change in total billings is not meaningful as 2015 billings have not been adjusted for the adoption of topic 606.
(1)   as presented on or derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows.
billings consists of amounts invoiced for subscription contracts with existing customers, renewal contracts, contracts for increased purchases with existing customers (expansion contracts), contracts with new customers, and contracts for professional services and training. factors that may cause our billings results to vary from period to period include the following:
•   billings duration. while we typically bill customers annually for our subscription services. customers sometimes request, and we accommodate, billings with durations less than or greater than the typical 12-month term.
•   contract start date. from time to time, we enter into contracts with a contract start date in the future, and we exclude these amounts from billings as these amounts are not included in our consolidated balance sheets, unless such amounts have been paid as of the balance sheet date.
•   foreign currency exchange rates. while a majority of our billings have historically been in u.s. dollars, an increasing percentage of our billings in recent periods has been in foreign currencies, particularly the euro and british pound sterling.
•   timing of contract renewals. while customers typically renew their contracts at the end of the contract term, from time to time customers may do so either before or after the scheduled expiration date. for example, in cases where we are successful in selling additional products or services to an existing customer, a customer may decide to renew its existing contract early to ensure that all its contracts expire on the same date. in other cases, prolonged negotiations or other factors may result in a contract not being renewed until after it has expired.
while we believe billings is a useful leading indicator regarding the performance of our business, due to the factors described above, an increase or decrease in new or renewed subscriptions in a reporting period may not have an immediate impact on billings for that reporting period.
to facilitate greater year-over-year comparability in our billings results, we disclose the impact that foreign currency rate fluctuations and fluctuations in billings duration had on our billings. the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations is calculated by translating the current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than u.s. dollars into u.s. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the prior period presented, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current period. the impact of fluctuations in billings duration is calculated by replacing the portion of multi-year billings in excess of 12 months during the current period with the portion of multi-year billings in excess of 12 months during the prior period presented. notwithstanding the adjustments described above, the comparability of billings results from period to period remains subject to the impact of variations in the dollar value of contracts with future start dates and the timing of contract renewals, for which no adjustments have been presented.
foreign currency rate fluctuations had a favorable impact of $31.0 million and $9.1 million on billings for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. changes in billings duration had a favorable impact of $7.4 million and $1.6 million for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
free cash flow. we define free cash flow, a non-gaap financial measure, as gaap net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment. purchases of property and equipment are otherwise included in cash used in investing activities under gaap. we believe information regarding free cash flow provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of the strength and performance of our business operations. however, our calculation of free cash flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
net cash provided by operating activities      $811,089                $642,940                  $159,081
purchases of property and equipment            (224,462    )           (150,510      )           (105,562      )
*as adjusted to reflect the impact of the full retrospective adoption of topic 606. see note 2 for further details.
(1)   free cash flow for the year ended december 31, 2018 includes the cash outflow of $145.3 million relating to the repayments of convertible senior notes attributable to debt discount. free cash flow for the year ended december 31, 2016 includes the cash outflow of a $267.5 million payment for aggregate legal settlements. refer to note 11 and 18, respectively in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for further details.
average contract term. we calculate the average contract term for new customers, expansion contracts and renewals based on the term of those contracts entered into during the period weighted by their acv. revised mapping of customers in the current period may result in revised new customer, expansion and renewal contract terms for previous periods, due to adjustments for acquisitions, spin-offs, improved subsidiary mapping, consolidations and updates to customer duns numbers. previously disclosed average contract terms may be restated to reflect such adjustments to allow for comparability. the average new customer contract term was 35 months, 32 months, and 31 months for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. the average expansion contract term was  months for the year ended december 31, 2018 and  months for each of the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the average renewal contract term was  months for each of the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 and  months for the year ended december 31, 2016.
g2k customer count. the global 2000 (g2k) customer count is defined as the total number of g2k companies in our customer base as of the end of the period. our g2k customer count was 883, 810, and 721 as of december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the forbes global 2000 is an annual ranking of the top 2,000 public companies in the world by forbes magazine. the ranking is based on a mix of four metrics: sales, profit, assets, and market value. the forbes global 2000 is updated annually in the second quarter of the calendar year. current and prior period g2k customer counts are based on the most recent list for comparability purposes. we also adjust the g2k count for acquisitions, spin-offs and other market activity. for example, we add a g2k customer when a g2k company that is not our customer acquires a company in our existing customer base that is not a g2k company. when we enter into a contract with a g2k parent company, or any of its related subsidiaries, or any combination of entities within a g2k company, we count only one g2k customer. we do not count further penetration into entities within a given g2k as a new customer in the g2k customer count. our g2k customer count also excludes customers that have only purchased our express product offering, which is our entry-level it service management solution. our g2k customer count does not include large private companies, government agencies and educational organizations, which represent a growing portion of our customer base. as a result, our g2k customer count metric has become less relevant to our business over time and we do not plan to disclose this metric in future filings.
average acv per g2k customer. we calculate average acv for our g2k customers by taking aggregate acv from g2k customers as of the end of the period divided by the total number of g2k customers as of the end of the period. our average acv per g2k customer was approximately $1.7 million, $1.3 million, and $1.1 million as of december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. acv is calculated based on the foreign exchange rate in effect at the time the contract was entered into, and as a result, foreign currency rate fluctuations could cause variability in the average acv per g2k customer. prior g2k customer counts used in calculating acv per g2k customer are adjusted for the most recent forbes global 2000 list for comparability purposes. as discussed above, average acv per g2k customer has become less relevant to our business over time as the underlying g2k customer count does not include large private companies, government agencies and education organizations, which represent a growing portion of our customer base. as a result, we do not plan to disclose this metric in future filings.
components of results of operations revenues subscription revenues. subscription revenues are primarily comprised of fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service for both self-hosted offerings and cloud-based subscription offerings, and related support and updates, if any, to the subscription service during the subscription term. for our cloud-based offerings, we recognize revenue ratably over the subscription term. for self-hosted offerings, a substantial portion of the sales price is recognized upon delivery of the software, which may cause greater variability in our subscription revenues and subscription gross margin. pricing includes multiple instances, hosting and support services, data backup and disaster recovery services, as well as future updates, when and if available, offered during the subscription term. we typically invoice our customers for subscription fees in annual increments upon execution of the initial contract or subsequent renewal. our contracts are generally non-cancelable during the subscription term, though a customer can terminate for breach if we materially fail to perform.
professional services and other revenues. professional services revenues consist of fees associated with professional services. our arrangements for professional services are primarily on a time-and-materials basis. we generally invoice our professional services monthly in arrears based on actual hours and expenses incurred, and revenues are recognized as services are delivered. some of our professional services arrangements are on a fixed fee or subscription basis, under which we recognize revenues on a proportional performance basis or ratably over the contract term. other revenues primarily consist of fees from customer training delivered on-site or through publicly available classes. typical payment terms require our customers to pay us within 30 days of invoice.
we generate sales directly through our sales team and, to a lesser extent, indirectly through resale partners. we also offer a portfolio of professional and other services, both directly and through our network of partners. revenues from our direct sales organization represented 84% for the year ended december 31, 2018, and 88% for each of the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016. for purposes of this disclosure, revenues from systems integrators and managed services providers are included as revenues from our direct sales organization.
allocation of overhead costs overhead costs associated with office facilities, it and certain depreciation related to infrastructure that is not dedicated for customer use or research and development use are allocated to cost of revenues and operating expenses based on headcount.
cost of revenues cost of subscription revenues. cost of subscription revenues consists primarily of expenses related to hosting our services and providing support to our customers. these expenses are comprised of data center capacity costs, which include colocation costs associated with our data centers as well as interconnectivity between data centers, depreciation related to our infrastructure hardware equipment dedicated for customer use, amortization of intangible assets, expenses associated with software, it services and support dedicated for customer use, personnel-related costs directly associated with data center operations and customer support, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, and allocated overhead.
cost of professional services and other revenues. cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of personnel-related costs directly associated with our professional services and training departments, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, the costs of contracted third-party partners, travel expenses and allocated overhead.
professional services are performed directly by our services team, as well as by contracted third-party partners. fees paid by us to third-party partners are primarily recognized as cost of revenues as the professional services are delivered. cost of revenues associated with our professional services engagements contracted with third-party partners as a percentage of professional services and other revenues was 18%, 22% and 21% for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our sales and marketing staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation. sales and marketing expenses also include the amortization of commissions paid to our sales employees and third-party referral fees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits. from time to time, third parties provide us referrals for which we pay a referral fee. we include revenues associated with these referrals as part of revenues from our direct sales organization. referral fees paid to these third parties are generally 10% of the customer's net new acv. we defer referral fees paid as they are considered incremental selling costs associated with acquiring customer contracts, and include the amortization of these referral fees in sales and marketing expense. in addition, sales and marketing expenses include expenses offset by proceeds related to our annual knowledge user conference (knowledge), other marketing program expenses, which include events other than knowledge, and costs associated with purchasing advertising and marketing data, software and subscription services dedicated for sales and marketing use and allocated overhead. as part of our adoption of topic 606, during the year ended december 31, 2018, we recorded a decrease in sales and marketing expenses and a corresponding increase to our deferred commissions asset of $5.4 million. these adjustments reflect the correction of previously undercapitalized incremental fringe benefit costs associated with sales commissions that were paid since 2012. we concluded that these adjustments were not material to the current period or any previously reported periods presented, as adjusted for the full retrospective adoption of topic 606.
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our research and development staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead. research and development expenses also include data center capacity costs, costs associated with outside services contracted for research and development purposes, amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of infrastructure hardware equipment that is used solely for research and development purposes.
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, facilities and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, external legal, accounting and other professional services fees, other corporate expenses, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead.
legal settlements legal settlements consist of one-time aggregate charges related to the settlement agreements with hewlett packard enterprise company (hpe) and bmc software, inc. (bmc) in 2016. refer to note 18 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for further details regarding these matters.
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes. due to cumulative losses, we maintain a valuation allowance against our u.s. and certain foreign deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2018 and 2017. we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including but not limited to earnings history, projected future outcomes, industry and market trends and the nature of each of the deferred tax assets in assessing the extent to which a valuation allowance should be applied against our u.s. and foreign deferred tax assets.
results of operations the following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented. all amounts and disclosures for each of the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 set forth in the tables below have been updated to comply with the new standards under topic 606, including previously reported amounts, which are labeled "as adjusted" in these selected consolidated financial statements. the period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results.

subscription revenues increased $681.8 million during the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to the prior year, driven by increased purchases by existing customers and an increase in customer count. included in subscription revenues is $118.5 million and $80.2 million of revenues recognized upfront from the delivery of software associated with self-hosted offerings during the year ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. we expect subscription revenues to grow in absolute dollars as we continue to add new customers and existing customers increase their usage of our products, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues in the year ending december 31, 2019. our expectations for revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses for the year ending december 31, 2019 are based on foreign exchange rates as of december 31, 2018.
subscription revenues consist of the following:

our service management products include our platform, itsm, itbm, customer service management, hr service delivery, security operations, itam, and grc, and are generally priced on a per user basis. our itom products are generally priced on a per node basis.
professional services and other revenues increased $8.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to the prior year, due to an increase in the services provided to new and existing customers. we expect professional services and other revenues for the year ending december 31, 2019 to increase in absolute dollar terms, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues when compared to professional services and other revenues for the year ended december 31, 2018 as we are increasingly focused on deploying our internal professional services organization as a strategic resource and relying on our partner ecosystem to contract directly with customers for service delivery.

cost of subscription revenues increased $101.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $31.4 million in personnel-related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $13.4 million in stock-based compensation and an increase of $9.2 million in other overhead expenses. depreciation expense increased $22.7 million due to purchases of infrastructure hardware equipment for our data centers and expenses associated with software and it services and technical support increased $10.3 million. in addition, data center capacity costs increased $6.3 million due to the addition of new data centers and the expansion of existing data centers, amortization of intangibles increased $4.1 million as a result of acquisitions and outside service costs increased $3.1 million due to an increase in contractors to support our customer contracts.
our subscription gross profit percentage increased to 83% for the year ended december 31, 2018, from 82% for the year ended december 31, 2017, due to improved data center utilization and economies of scale. the increase in revenues recognized upfront from the delivery of software associated with self-hosted offerings contributed to approximately one percentage point improvement in our subscription gross profit percentage for each of the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017. we expect our cost of subscription revenues to increase in absolute dollar terms as we provide subscription services to more customers and increase usage within our customer instances, but we expect such increase to be at a slower rate than the increase in our subscription revenues, leading to a slight increase in our subscription gross profit percentage for the year ending december 31, 2019 as we continue to leverage the investments we have made in our existing data center infrastructure. to the extent future acquisitions are consummated, our cost of subscription revenues may increase due to additional non-cash charges associated with the amortization of intangible assets acquired.
cost of professional services and other revenues increased $20.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $17.3 million in personnel-related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $5.4 million in stock-based compensation and an increase of $3.0 million in overhead expenses, partially offset by a decrease in outside service costs of $4.4 million, primarily due to a decrease in professional services performed by contracted third-party partners.
our professional services and other gross loss percentage increased to 9% during the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to 3% in the prior year, primarily due to stock-based compensation and other personnel-related costs increasing at a higher rate than professional services and other revenues as we invest in specialized resources to support our newer products.

sales and marketing expenses increased $308.1 million during the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $115.5 million in personnel-related costs excluding stock-based compensation and commissions, an increase of $57.5 million in stock-based compensation and an increase of $27.6 million in overhead expenses. expenses associated with commissions and third-party referral fees increased $46.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the prior year, due to an increase in contracts with new customers, expansion and renewal contracts. amortization expenses associated with commissions and third-party referral fees, including as applicable their related payroll taxes and fringe benefits, amounted to 6% of subscription revenues for each of the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017. outside services costs increased $10.1 million during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in contractors and professional fees to support our sales and marketing functions. marketing program expenses, which include events other than knowledge, and costs associated with purchasing advertising and market data, increased $36.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the prior year. expenses related to knowledge, net of proceeds increased $6.8 million due to a 21% year-over-year increase in registrations. loss from write-off of property and equipment increased $4.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to write off of internal-use software.
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollar terms for the year ending december 31, 2019 compared to the year ended december 31, 2018, as we continue to expand our direct sales force, increase our marketing activities, grow our international operations and build brand awareness, but decrease as a percentage of total revenues.

research and development expenses increased $152.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount, which resulted in an increase of $81.5 million in personnel-related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $43.2 million in stock-based compensation and an increase of $19.7 million in overhead expenses. research and development expenses also increased $4.0 million due to an increase in data center capacity costs and depreciation of infrastructure hardware equipment that is used solely for research and development purposes and $1.4 million as a result of additional expense related to software and it services and technical support for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the prior year.
we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollar terms for the year ending december 31, 2019, as we continue to improve the existing functionality of our services, develop new applications to fill market needs and enhance our core platform, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues.

stock-based compensation expense increased $149.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to the prior year, primarily due to additional grants to current and new employees and increased weighted-average grant date fair value of stock awards.
stock-based compensation expense is inherently difficult to forecast due to fluctuations in our stock price. based upon our stock price as of december 31, 2018, we expect stock-based compensation expense to continue to increase in absolute dollar terms for the year ending december 31, 2019 as we continue to issue stock-based awards to our employees, but decrease as a percentage of total revenues.
foreign currency exchange our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues. revenues outside north america represented 34% and 33% of total revenues for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for sales outside of the united states, the general weakening of the u.s. dollar relative to other major foreign currencies (primarily the euro and british pound sterling) from the year ended december 31, 2017 to the year ended december 31, 2018 had a favorable impact on our revenues. for entities reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31, 2018 at the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended december 31, 2017 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our reported subscription revenues would have been $27.5 million lower and our reported professional services and other revenues would have been $2.2 million lower.
in addition, because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for cost of sales and operating expenses outside of the united states, the general weakening of the u.s. dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended december 31, 2017 to the year ended december 31, 2018 had an unfavorable impact on our cost of sales and operating expenses. for entities reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31, 2018 at the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended december 31, 2017 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our reported sales and marketing expenses would have been $4.6 million lower. the impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended december 31, 2017 to the year ended december 31, 2018 is not material to cost of revenues, research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses.

interest expense decreased $0.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to the prior year, due to the early conversions and maturity of the 2018 notes, offset by the increase in the aggregate amount of convertible debt and associated amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to the 2022 notes. for the year ending december 31, 2019, we expect to incur approximately $33.3 million in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to the 2022 notes.

interest income and other income (expense), net increased $51.8 million during the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to the prior year, primarily due to $19.3 million of realized gains relating to changes in the market value of our marketable equity securities. refer to note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for further details. interest income and other income (expense), net also increased $19.2 million due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, net of the effect of our foreign currency derivative contracts and interest income increased $17.5 million due to higher cash and investment balances and higher yields on our invested balances during the year ended december 31, 2018, partially offset by a $4.1 million loss recorded on early note conversions.
in order to manage certain exposures to currency fluctuations, we initiated a limited hedging program during the year ended december 31, 2018 by entering into foreign currency derivative contracts with maturities of 12 months or less to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities. these hedging contracts may reduce, but cannot entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements.

our effective tax rate was 32% for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to (3%) for the prior year ended december 31, 2017. we had a benefit from income taxes of $12.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to a provision for income taxes of $3.4 million for the prior year, primarily due to the one-time indirect tax benefit of topic 606 on income taxes associated with intercompany adjustments offset by the increase in current cash taxes payable in foreign jurisdictions. see note 17 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes.
we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our u.s. federal and state deferred tax assets and certain foreign deferred tax assets, and the significant components of the tax expense recorded are current cash taxes payable in various jurisdictions. the cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction's individual tax rates, laws on timing of recognition of income and deductions, and availability of net operating losses and tax credits. given the full valuation allowance, sensitivity of current cash taxes to local rules and our foreign structuring, we expect that our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. to the extent sufficient positive evidence becomes available, we may release all or a portion of our valuation allowance in one or more future periods. a release of the valuation allowance, if any, would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded.

stock-based compensation expense increased $76.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount and increased weighted-average grant date fair value of equity awards.
foreign currency exchange our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues. revenues outside north america represented 33% and 32% of total revenues for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for sales outside of the united states, the general weakening of the u.s. dollar relative to other major foreign currencies (primarily the euro and british pound sterling) from the year ended december 31, 2016 to the year ended december 31, 2017 had a favorable impact on our revenues. for entities reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31, 2017 at the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended december 31, 2016 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our reported subscription revenues would have been $5.3 million lower. the impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended december 31, 2016 to the year ended december 31, 2017 is not material to professional services and other revenues.

interest expense increased $20.1 million during the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the prior year, due to the increase in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to our convertible senior notes, including the 2022 notes issued in the three months ended june 30, 2017.

interest income and other income (expense), net decreased $0.6 million during the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased foreign exchange loss, partially offset by increased interest income. foreign exchange losses increased $9.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the prior year as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. interest income increased $8.1 million due to the higher cash balances and higher yields on our invested balances during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the prior year.

seasonality, cyclicality and quarterly trends we have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements for our services. we sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the quarter ended december 31. the increase in customer agreements for the quarter ended december 31 is primarily a result of the terms of our commission plans, which incentivize our direct sales force to meet their annual quotas by december 31, and large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry, which are driven primarily by the expiration of annual authorized budgeted expenditures. in addition, the number of agreements entered into with the u.s. federal government has historically been higher in the third quarter of each year, driven primarily by timing of annual budget expenditures. furthermore, we usually sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last month, and often the last two weeks, of each quarter. this seasonality in the timing of entering into customer contracts is sometimes not immediately apparent in our billings due to the fact that we typically exclude cloud-offering contracts with a future start date from our billings. similarly, this seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent, and sometimes is not immediately apparent in our revenues, due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenues from our cloud offering contracts over the term of the subscription agreement, which is generally 12 to 36 months. although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance.
our revenues have increased over the periods presented due to increased sales to new and existing customers. our operating expenses have increased over the periods presented primarily due to increases in headcount, data center operations and other related expenses to support our growth. we have historically seen an increase in marketing expenses in the quarter ended june 30, and a corresponding decrease in marketing expenses in the quarter ended september 30 due to the expenses incurred for our annual knowledge user conference, partially offset by related proceeds. marketing expenses in the quarter ended december 31 are also historically higher due to user forums we conduct in that quarter. we anticipate operating expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to focus on investing in the long-term growth of our business.
our free cash flow is impacted by the timing of collections and disbursements, including the timing of capital expenditures. we have historically seen higher collections in the quarter ended march 31 due to seasonality in timing of entering into customer contracts as described above. we have historically seen higher disbursements in the quarter ended march 31, primarily due to payouts under the preceding year's annual commission plans and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan, and expect to continue to see higher disbursements in the quarter ended march 31 as we start our 401(k) match program in the quarter ending march 31, 2019.
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations. as of december 31, 2018, we had $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which $253.9 million represented cash held by foreign subsidiaries. $249.9 million of the $1.5 billion is denominated in currencies other than u.s. dollar. in addition, we had $581.9 million in long-term investments that provide additional capital resources. we do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations.
prior to the enactment of the tax act, we considered earnings from foreign operations to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states. subsequent to the enactment of the tax act, we determined that the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will no longer be considered indefinitely reinvested, except in certain designated jurisdictions in which the resident entity is a service provider which is not expected to generate substantial amounts of cash in excess of what may be reinvested by the local entity.
in may and june 2017, we issued the 2022 notes with an aggregate principal amount of $782.5 million. in connection with the issuance of the 2022 notes, we entered into the 2022 note hedge transactions and 2022 warrant transactions with certain financial institutions. the price of our common stock was greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price of the 2022 notes for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the quarters ended june 30, 2018 and september 30, 2018. therefore, the 2022 notes were convertible at the holders' option beginning on july 1, 2018 through december 31, 2018. the 2022 notes are not convertible at the holders' option for the quarter ending march 31, 2019. the impact of the 2022 notes on our liquidity will depend on the settlement method we elect. we currently intend to settle the principal amount of any converted 2022 notes in cash. we have not received any conversion requests for our 2022 notes.
in november 2013, we issued the 2018 notes with an aggregate principal amount of $575.0 million. we settled $413.2 million principal amount of the 2018 notes in early conversions and the remaining principal amount was settled on november 1, 2018, the maturity date of our 2018 notes. the conversion value over the principal amount for the early 2018 note conversions was settled in cash from the exercise of the 2018 note hedges. the conversion value over the principal amount for the principal amount settled on november 1, 2018 was satisfied with approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock, which was entirely offset by shares of our common stock delivered to us by the 2018 note hedge counterparties under the 2018 note hedge, and cash in lieu of fractional shares. the shares delivered to us by the 2018 note hedge counterparties were immediately retired. as a result of the early note conversions, we recorded a loss of $4.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. as a result of the settlement of the 2018 notes and the 2018 note hedges, we recorded an aggregate $6.4 million net reduction to additional paid-in capital, reflecting $773.3 million of fair value adjustments to the conversion option settled, offset by a $766.9 million benefit from the exercise of the 2018 note hedges. the 2018 notes and 2018 note hedge are no longer outstanding, and the portion of the 2018 warrants that have not yet been automatically exercised remain outstanding as of the date of this filing.
we have issued and expect to continue to issue additional shares of our common stock in the first half of 2019 upon the automatic exercise of the 2018 warrants. additionally, we expect to issue additional shares of our common stock in the second half of 2022 upon the automatic exercise of the 2022 warrants. as the 2018 warrants and the 2022 warrants will be net share settled, the total number of shares of our common stock we will issue depends on the daily volume-weighted average stock prices over a 60 trading day period beginning on the first expiration date of the 2018 warrants, which was february 1, 2019, and the first expiration date of the 2022 warrants, which will be september 1, 2022. because exercises of the 2018 warrants and the 2022 warrants will be net share settled, there will not be an impact on our liquidity. refer to note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
we anticipate our current cash and cash equivalents balance and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including the repayment of our 2022 notes, expansion of data centers, lease obligations, expenditures related to the growth of our headcount and the acquisition of fixed assets, intangibles, and investments in office facilities, to accommodate our growth for at least the next 12 months. whether these resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth, operating results, cash utilized for acquisitions and/or debt retirements if any are consummated, and the capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our services. if we require additional capital resources to grow our business at any time in the future, we may seek to finance our operations from the current funds available or seek additional equity or debt financing.

operating activities cash provided by operating activities mainly consists of our net loss adjusted for repayments of convertible senior notes attributable to debt discount, certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, amortization of premiums on investments, amortization of deferred commissions, amortization of issuance cost and debt discount, stock-based compensation, and changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year.
net cash provided by operating activities was $811.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $642.9 million for the prior year. the increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to a decrease in net loss of $90.1 million. the remaining change was due to an increase in non-cash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operations and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities.
net cash provided by operating activities was $642.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $159.1 million for the prior year. the increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to $267.5 million cash paid for aggregate legal settlements during the year ended december 31, 2016 (refer to note 18 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for further details). the remaining change was due to an increase in non-cash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operations and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2018 was $347.4 million compared to $883.9 million for the prior year. the decrease in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to a $612.5 million decrease in net purchases of investments and a $20.8 million decrease in business combinations, net of cash and restricted cash acquired. the decrease in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by a $74.0 million increase in capital expenditures related to the purchases of infrastructure hardware equipment to support the expansion of our data centers as well as investments in leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment to support our headcount growth, an $17.7 million increase in purchases of other intangibles and a $5.1 million increase in purchases of strategic investments.
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2017 was $883.9 million compared to $108.2 million for the prior year. the increase in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to a $714.7 million increase in net purchases of investments, a $44.9 million increase in capital expenditures related to the purchases of infrastructure hardware equipment to support the expansion of our data centers as well as investments in leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment to support our headcount growth, a $23.9 million increase in business combinations, net of cash and restricted cash acquired, and a $4.3 million increase in purchases of strategic investments. the increase in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by a $12.1 million decrease in purchases of other intangibles.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2018 was $607.4 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $538.9 million for the prior year. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we had $698.2 million in net proceeds from issuance of the 2022 notes and the related 2022 note hedge and 2022 warrant transactions, and used $55.0 million in cash to repurchase shares of our common stock. during the year ended december 31, 2018, we had additional financing cash outflows of $429.6 million relating to the repayments of the 2018 notes attributable to principal and $99.1 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, partially offset by a $21.6 million increase in proceeds from employee equity plans.
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2017 was $538.9 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of $55.8 million for the prior year. the change was primarily due to a $698.2 million increase in net proceeds from issuance of the 2022 notes and the 2022 note hedge and 2022 warrant transactions entered into during the year ended december 31, 2017 and a $16.2 million increase in proceeds from employee stock plans, partially offset by a $62.0 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards and a $55.0 million increase in cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock.
contractual obligations and commitments the following table represents our future non-cancelable contractual obligations as of december 31, 2018, aggregated by type:

in addition to the obligations in the table above, $4.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of december 31, 2018. it is uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled.
off-balance sheet arrangements during all periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. as such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships.
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. these items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material.
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we report our revenues in two categories: (i) subscriptions and (ii) professional services and other.
revenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.
we determine revenue recognition through the following steps:
•   identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
•   identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
•   determination of the transaction price;
•   allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
•   recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.
subscription revenues subscription revenues are primarily comprised of subscription fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service, related support and updates, if any, to the subscribed service during the subscription term. for our cloud services, we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract, the date we make our services available to our customers. our contracts with customers typically include a fixed amount of consideration and are generally non-cancelable and without any refund-type provisions. we typically invoice our customers annually in advance for our subscription services upon execution of the initial contract or subsequent renewal, and our invoices are typically due within 30 days from the invoice date.
subscription revenues also include revenues from self-hosted offerings in which customers deploy, or we grant customers the option to deploy without significant penalty, our subscription service internally or contract with a third party to host the software. for these contracts, we account for the software element and the related support and updates separately as they are distinct performance obligations (refer to the discussion below related to contracts with multiple performance obligations for further details). the transaction price is allocated to separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (ssp) basis. transaction price allocated to the software element is recognized upon delivery, which is when transfer of control of the software to the customer is complete. the transaction price allocated to the related support and updates are recognized ratably over the contract term.
professional services and other revenues our professional services arrangements are primarily on a time-and-materials basis, and revenues on these arrangements are recognized as the services are delivered. we typically invoice our customers monthly in arrears for these professional services based on actual hours and expenses incurred, and our invoices are typically due within 30 days from the invoice date. some of our professional services arrangements are on a fixed fee or subscription basis, under which we recognize revenues on a proportional performance basis or ratably over the contract term. in instances where certain milestones are required to be met before revenues are recognized, we defer professional services revenues and the associated costs until milestone criteria have been met. other revenues consist of fees from customer training delivered on-site or through publicly available classes.
contracts with multiple performance obligations we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. for these contracts, the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative ssp basis. evaluating the terms and conditions included within our customer contracts to ensure appropriate revenue recognition and determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. significant judgment is also involved in determining ssp by considering the historical selling price of these performance obligations in similar transactions as well as other factors, including, but not limited to, competitive pricing of similar products, other software vendor pricing, industry publications and current pricing practices.
deferred commissions deferred commissions are the incremental selling costs that are associated with acquiring customer contracts and consist primarily of sales commissions paid to our sales force and referral fees paid to independent third-parties. capitalized sales commissions also include the associated payroll taxes and fringe benefit costs associated with payments to our sales employees to the extent they are incremental. commissions and referral fees earned upon the execution of initial and expansion contracts are primarily deferred and amortized over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years. commissions earned upon the renewal of customer contracts are deferred and amortized over the average renewal term. additionally, for self-hosted offerings, consistent with the recognition of subscription revenues for self-hosted offerings, a portion of the commission cost is expensed upfront when the self-hosted offering is made available. the determination of the period of benefit requires significant judgment by taking into consideration our customer contracts, our technology life cycle and other factors. we include amortization of deferred commissions in sales and marketing expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).
business combinations the allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets. these estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets included, but are not limited to, cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, discount rates, the time and expense that would be necessary to recreate the assets and the profit margin a market participant would receive. these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.
goodwill, intangible assets and other long lived assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired.
we evaluate and test the recoverability of goodwill in our single reporting unit for impairment at least annually during our fourth quarter or more frequently if circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. we periodically review the carrying amounts of long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. we have not recognized any impairment charges related to goodwill and long-lived assets during the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 because the aggregate fair value of our company has consistently and materially exceeded the carrying value of our single reporting unit and asset group.
screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred, including market conditions, operating fundamentals, competition and general economic conditions, requires significant judgment. additionally, changes in the technology industry occur frequently and quickly. to the extent an impairment indicator exists, the measurement of the impairment charge requires significant judgment, and could result in a material charge to operating expenses.
stock-based compensation we recognize compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock units (rsus) with only a service condition on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting term of four years. for rsus granted with both service condition and a performance condition, the expenses are recognized on a graded vesting basis over the requisite service period of generally three years, after assessing the probability of achieving requisite performance criteria. this has the impact of greater stock-based compensation expense during the initial years of the vesting period as stock-based compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award as though the award were, in substance, multiple awards. we recognize compensation expense related to shares issued pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan (espp) on a straight-line basis over the six-month offering period. we estimate the fair value of options using the black-scholes options pricing model and fair value of rsu awards using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. we recognize compensation expense net of estimated forfeiture activity, which is based on historical forfeiture rates. we evaluate the forfeiture rates at least annually or when events or circumstances indicate a change may be needed. this may cause a fluctuation in our stock-based compensation in the period of change.
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be reversed. we recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates as income and expense in the period that includes the enactment date. a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. in determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, carryforward periods and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. due to cumulative losses over recent years and based on all available positive and negative evidence, we have determined that it is more likely than not that our u.s. and certain foreign deferred tax assets will not be realizable as of december 31, 2018. to the extent sufficient positive evidence becomes available, we may release a portion, or all, of our valuation allowance in one or more future periods. a release of the valuation allowance, if any, would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded.
our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. we measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision. significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law or guidance, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.
we calculate the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns when identified. the amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by u.s. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. the estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management's assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances existing at that time. to the extent the assessment of such tax position changes, we record the change in estimate in the period in which we make the determination.
new accounting pronouncements pending adoption the impact of recently issued accounting standards is set forth in note 2, summary of significant accounting policies, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.

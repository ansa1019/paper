item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is intended to provide readers of our consolidated financial statements with the perspectives of management. this should allow the readers of this report to obtain a comprehensive understanding of our businesses, strategies, current trends, and future prospects. our md&a includes the following sections:
• executive overview: high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business.
• critical accounting policies and estimates: policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments underlying our financial statements.
• results of operations: a more detailed discussion of our revenue and expenses.
• liquidity and capital resources: discussion of key aspects of our statements of cash flows, changes in our balance sheets, and our financial commitments.
you should note that this md&a contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. please see the section entitled "forward-looking statements" immediately preceding part 1 for important information to consider when evaluating such statements.
you should read this md&a in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in item 8 of this annual report. in fiscal 2018 we acquired tsheets.com llc, exactor, inc., and applatix, inc. we have included their results of operations in our consolidated results of operations from the dates of acquisitions.
in august 2017, we aligned our segment reporting for fiscal 2018 with our core customers and business partners. the consumer ecosystem offering moved from the small business segment into the consumer tax segment. the company also renamed the small business, consumer tax, and proconnect segments as the small business & self-employed, consumer, and strategic partner segments, respectively. the strategic partner segment will continue to manage our professional tax offerings. we have reclassified certain amounts related to our reportable segments previously reported in our financial statements to conform to the current presentation. see note 14 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information.
in fiscal 2016 we completed the sales of our demandforce, quickbase, and quicken businesses. we have reclassified our statements of operations for fiscal 2016 to reflect all of these businesses as discontinued operations. because the cash flows of these discontinued operations were not material , we have not segregated them on our statements of cash flows. see "results of operations - non-operating income and expense - discontinued operations" later in this item 7 for more information. unless otherwise noted, the following discussion pertains to our continuing operations.
executive overview this overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business. we believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2018 as well as our future prospects. this summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
industry trends and seasonality industry trends the rapid expansion of cloud-based services is creating a more dynamic and highly competitive software industry. high availability and speed of service are reshaping customer expectations around the world. these shifts are accelerating product introductions and enhancements. among cloud-based service companies, free business models and micro-job solutions are also becoming more prevalent within the industry. personalization and data-driven insights, augmented by artificial intelligence and machine learning, are transforming the way that people manage their financial lives.
seasonality our consumer offerings have significant seasonal patterns. as a result, during each of the last three fiscal years the total consolidated revenue for our third quarter ended april 30 has represented nearly half of our annual total consolidated revenue for those years. we expect the seasonality of our consumer business to continue to have a significant impact on our quarterly financial results in the future.
tables of contents key challenges and risks our growth strategy depends upon our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new markets, and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market. our future growth also increasingly depends on the strength of our third-party business relationships and our ability to continue to develop, maintain, and strengthen new and existing relationships. to remain competitive and continue to grow, we are investing significant resources in our product development, marketing, and sales capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.
as we offer more online services, the ongoing operation and availability of our platforms and systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important. because we help customers manage their financial lives, we face risks associated with the hosting, collection, use, and retention of personal customer information and data. we are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.
for our consumer and professional tax offerings, we have implemented additional security measures and are continuing to work with state and federal governments to share information regarding suspicious filings. we continue to invest in security measures and to work with the broader industry and government to protect our customers against this type of fraud.
for a complete discussion of the most significant risks and uncertainties affecting our business, please see "forward-looking statements" immediately preceding part 1 and "risk factors" in item 1a of part i of this report.
overview of financial results the most important financial indicators that we use to assess our business are revenue growth for the company as a whole, for each reportable segment, and for product lines within each reportable segment; operating income growth and operating income margins for the company as a whole and for each reportable segment; earnings per share; and cash flow from operations. we also track certain non-financial drivers of revenue growth and, when material, identify them in the applicable discussions of segment results below. these non-financial drivers include, for example, customer growth and retention for all of our businesses. online service offerings are a significant part of our business. our total service and other revenue was $4.5 billion or 75% of our total revenue in fiscal 2018 and we expect our total service and other revenue to continue to grow in the future.
revenue of                small business &amp; self-employed revenue of   consumer revenue of operating income of       net income of                                   diluted net income per share of tables of contents critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), we are required to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue, operating income or loss and net income or loss, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. we believe that the estimates, assumptions, and judgments involved in the following accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies:
•   revenue recognition
•   business combinations
•   goodwill, acquired intangible assets, and other long-lived assets - impairment assessments
•   accounting for income taxes - estimates of deferred taxes, valuation allowances, and uncertain tax positions our senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this annual report on form 10-k with the audit and risk committee of our board of directors.
revenue recognition we derive revenue from the sale of software subscriptions, hosted services, packaged software products, financial supplies, technical support plans, transaction fees, merchant services hardware, and multiple element arrangements that may include a combination of these items. we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue. for additional information, see "revenue recognition" in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report. we generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. however, determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves exercising judgment and using estimates that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. for example, for multiple element arrangements containing only software and software-related elements, we must exercise judgment and use estimates in order to (1) allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver; (2) determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) determine whether vendor-specific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element; and (4) determine whether and when each element has been delivered. for multiple element arrangements containing non-software elements, we must exercise judgment and use estimates in order to (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of vendor-specific evidence of fair value (vsoe) if available, third-party evidence (tpe) if vsoe is not available, and estimated selling price (esp) if neither vsoe nor tpe is available; and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method. if we were to change any of these judgments or estimates, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied.
business combinations as described in "description of business and summary of significant accounting policies - business combinations," in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report, under the acquisition method of accounting we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. we measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred, which we also measure at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. the acquisition method of accounting requires us to exercise judgment and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, and contingencies. this method also requires us to refine these estimates over a one-year measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. if we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could materially decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet.
significant estimates and assumptions that we must make in estimating the fair value of acquired technology, customer lists, and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could record impairment charges. in addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. if our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.
tables of contents goodwill, acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets - impairment assessments we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. we test for potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or whenever indicators of impairment arise. the timing of the annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods.
as described in "description of business and summary of significant accounting policies - goodwill, acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets," in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report, in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model (known as the income approach) and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses (known as the market approach). the income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions, including market factors specific to the business, the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time, long-term growth rates for the business, and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. we evaluate cash flows at the reporting unit level. although the assumptions we use in our discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our internal strategic plans and forecasts, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from each reporting unit and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. when using the market approach, we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses. we base our judgments on factors such as size, growth rates, profitability, risk, and return on investment. we also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue, operating income, and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own businesses. we had a total of $1.6 billion in goodwill on our balance sheet at july 31, 2018. see note 5 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a summary of goodwill by reportable segment.
we estimate the recoverability of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite useful lives by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate. in order to estimate the fair value of those assets, we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets. the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. we also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite lives. we had a total of $61 million in net acquired intangible assets on our balance sheet at july 31, 2018.
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. they can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. for example, if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units, we may be required to record future impairment charges for goodwill and acquired intangible assets. impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet.
during the fourth quarters of fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, and fiscal 2016 we performed our annual goodwill impairment tests. using the methodology described in "description of business and summary of significant accounting policies - goodwill, acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets," in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report, we determined that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and that they were not impaired. in addition, during this analysis we concluded that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values.
accounting for share-based compensation plans at july 31, 2018, there was $882 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future. we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of 2.7 years.
tables of contents service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods. we may elect to use different assumptions under our option valuation model in the future, which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share.
restricted stock units (rsus) granted typically vest based on continued service. we value these time-based rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method. we amortize the fair value of time-based rsus on a straight-line basis over the service period. certain rsus granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market goals. we estimate the fair value of performance-based rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria will be met. each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performance-based rsus if necessary. we amortize the fair values of performance-based rsus over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award. we estimate the fair value of market-based rsus at the date of grant using a monte carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award. the monte carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based rsus at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based rsus at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. however, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria. all of the rsus we grant have dividend rights that are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards, so we do not adjust the intrinsic (market) value of our rsus for dividends. see note 11 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information.
legal contingencies we are subject to certain legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business. we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure. if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss. if we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. significant judgment is required in the determination of whether a potential loss is probable, reasonably possible, or remote as well as in the determination of whether a potential exposure is reasonably estimable. our accruals are based on the best information available at the time. as additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.
accounting for income taxes - estimates of deferred taxes, valuation allowances, and uncertain tax positions we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the united states internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdictions. we estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our balance sheet. we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. to the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations.
at july 31, 2018, we had net deferred tax assets of $80 million which included a valuation allowance of $93 million for loss and tax credit carryforwards related to state research and experimentation tax credits, foreign losses, and state operating and capital losses. we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire. while we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient, we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. the assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. see note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information.
we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.
tables of contents the tax cuts and jobs act significantly changes existing u.s. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business. see note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information.

total net revenue increased $787 million or 15% in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. our small business & self-employed segment revenue increased 18% due to growth in the online ecosystem driven by customer acquisition. our consumer segment revenue increased 14% due to a higher average revenue per customer, growth in turbotax federal units, and a shift in mix to our higher end product offerings. see "segment results" later in this item 7 for more information.
operating income from continuing operations increased 7% in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. the increase was due to the higher revenue described above partially offset by higher costs for staffing, advertising and other marketing programs, outside services, and share-based compensation. we also recorded a $79 million loss related to the sale of our data center in quincy, washington in the 2018 period.
net income from continuing operations increased 25% in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 due to the increase in operating income described above and a lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act (2017 tax act). the net income for fiscal 2018 includes tax benefits related to share-based compensation and the reorganization of a subsidiary during the year which were partially offset by a charge related to the re-measurement of our deferred tax asset balances as a result of the enactment of the 2017 tax act. see note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information. diluted net income per share increased 25% to $4.64, in line with the increase in net income.
total net revenue increased $483 million or 10% in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016. revenue in our small business & self-employed segment increased 13% due to growth in online ecosystem revenue and the impact of the changes to our quickbooks desktop software products. starting with the release of quickbooks 2015 in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, and for all subsequent versions, we began delivering ongoing enhancements and certain connected services for our quickbooks desktop software products. we plan to continue to provide ongoing enhancements and certain connected services for all future versions of these offerings. as a result of these changes, we recognize revenue for these quickbooks desktop software products as services are provided over approximately three years. revenue in our consumer segment increased 9% due to growth in turbotax federal units and a shift in mix to the higher end of our product lineup. revenue in our strategic partner segment increased 2% to $437 million in fiscal 2017. see "segment results" later in this item 7 for more information.
operating income from continuing operations increased 12% in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 due to the increase in revenue described above. higher revenue was partially offset by higher costs and expenses for staffing, advertising and other marketing programs, and share-based compensation. see "operating expenses" later in this item 7 for more information.
net income from continuing operations increased 20% in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 due to the increase in operating income and a lower effective tax rate in the fiscal 2017 period. see "non-operating income and expenses - income taxes" later in this item 7 for more information. diluted net income per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2017 increased 22% to $3.72 as a result of the increase in net income and the decline in weighted average diluted common shares compared with fiscal 2016.
tables of contents segment results the information below is organized in accordance with our three reportable segments. all of our segments operate and sell to customers primarily in the united states. international total net revenue was less than 5% of consolidated total net revenue for all periods presented.
segment operating income is segment net revenue less segment cost of revenue and operating expenses. segment expenses do not include certain costs, such as corporate selling and marketing, product development, general and administrative expenses and share-based compensation expenses, which are not allocated to specific segments. these unallocated costs totaled $1.62 billion in fiscal 2018, $1.32 billion in fiscal 2017, and $1.18 billion in fiscal 2016. unallocated costs increased in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 and in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 due to increased corporate product development and selling and marketing expenses in support of the growth of our businesses and higher share-based compensation expenses. segment expenses also do not include amortization of acquired technology, amortization of other acquired intangible assets, and goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. see note 14 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for reconciliations of total segment operating income to consolidated operating income from continuing operations for each fiscal year presented.

strategic partner segment operating income increased 6% in fiscal 2018 primarily due to the higher revenue described above and relatively stable spending.
revenue for our strategic partner segment increased $9 million or 2% in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016. during fiscal 2017 we made a strategic decision to focus less on price increases and more on customer retention by delivering awesome products and a valuable end to end experience. this resulted in slower revenue growth in fiscal 2017 than we have experienced historically.
strategic partner segment operating income decreased 2% in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 due to higher staffing expenses which more than offset the higher revenue described above.

our cost of revenue has three components: (1) cost of product revenue, which includes the direct costs of manufacturing and shipping or electronically downloading our desktop software products; (2) cost of service and other revenue, which reflects direct costs associated with providing services, including data center and support costs related to delivering online services; and (3) amortization of acquired technology, which represents the cost of amortizing developed technologies that we have obtained through acquisitions over their useful lives.
cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue was consistent across all periods presented. we expense costs of product revenue as they are incurred for delivered software and we do not defer any of these costs when product revenue is deferred.

total operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue increased slightly in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. total net revenue increased $787 million or 15% and total operating expenses increased $517 million or 17%. the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by $193 million for higher staffing expenses due to higher headcount, $127 million for advertising and other marketing programs, and $49 million for outside services. general and administrative expenses in the fiscal 2018 period include a $79 million loss related to the sale of our data center in quincy, washington.
total operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue decreased slightly in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. total net revenue increased $483 million or 10% and total operating expenses increased $273 million or 10%. the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by $152 million for higher staffing expenses due to higher headcount, $85 million for advertising and other marketing programs, and $48 million for share-based compensation expenses. share-based compensation expenses have been increasing over time because the total fair value of our share-based awards has generally been increasing.
non-operating income and expenses interest expense interest expense of $20 million in fiscal 2018 consisted primarily of interest on our unsecured term loan and unsecured revolving credit facility. interest expense of $31 million in fiscal 2017 consisted primarily of interest on our senior notes, unsecured term loan, and unsecured revolving credit facility. interest expense of $35 million in fiscal 2016 consisted primarily of interest on our senior notes, unsecured term loan, and unsecured revolving credit facilities. see note 8 and note 9 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information.
tables of contents interest and other income (expense), net
(1) in accordance with authoritative guidance, we record gains and losses associated with executive deferred compensation plan assets in interest and other income and gains and losses associated with the related liabilities in operating expenses. the total amounts recorded in operating expenses for each period are approximately equal to the total amounts recorded in interest and other income in those periods.
income taxes effective tax rate the tax cuts and jobs act (2017 tax act) was enacted on december 22, 2017 and reduces the u.s. statutory federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. the effective date of the tax rate change was january 1, 2018. the change resulted in a blended lower u.s. statutory federal rate of 26.9% for fiscal year 2018. as a result, we adjusted our annual effective tax rate for the year ended july 31, 2018, as well as adjusted our u.s. net deferred tax asset balance at the lower rates.
our effective tax rates for fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, and fiscal 2016 were approximately 19%, 29%, and 33%. excluding the tax benefits related to share-based compensation, the reorganization of a subsidiary, and the charge related to the re-measurement of our deferred tax asset balances, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was approximately 26% and did not differ significantly from the federal statutory rate of 26.9%. excluding the share-based compensation tax benefits, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was approximately 34% and did not differ significantly from the federal statutory rate of 35%. see note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information about our effective tax rates.
net deferred tax assets at july 31, 2018, we had net deferred tax assets of $80 million which included a valuation allowance of $93 million for loss and tax credit carryforwards related to state research and experimentation tax credits, foreign losses, and state operating and capital losses. we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire. while we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient, we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. the assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. see "critical accounting policies and estimates" earlier in this item 7 and note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information.
discontinued operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 we sold our demandforce, quickbase, and quicken businesses for $463 million in cash. we recorded a pre-tax gain of $354 million and a net gain of $173 million on the disposal of these three businesses in fiscal 2016. we have reclassified our statements of operations for all periods presented to reflect these businesses as discontinued operations. see note 7 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a more complete description of these discontinued operations and the impact that they have had on our statements of operations for the fiscal periods presented.
tables of contents liquidity and capital resources overview at july 31, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.7 billion, an increase of $939 million from july 31, 2017 due to the factors described in "statements of cash flows" below. our primary sources of liquidity have been cash from operations, which entails the collection of accounts receivable for products and services, and borrowings under our credit facilities. in fiscal 2018 our u.s. statutory tax rate decreased from 35% to 26.9% as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act, which increased our cash from operations. our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs, selling and marketing activities, capital projects, acquisitions of businesses, debt service costs and debt repayment, repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, and the payment of cash dividends. as discussed in "executive overview - industry trends and seasonality" earlier in this item 7, our business is subject to significant seasonality. the balance of our cash, cash equivalents and investments generally fluctuates with that seasonal pattern. we believe the seasonality of our business is likely to continue in the future.
the following table summarizes selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources at the dates indicated:

ratio of current assets to current liabilities     1.1 : 1              0.7 : 1
we have historically generated significant cash from operations and we expect to continue to do so during fiscal 2019. our cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $1.7 billion at july 31, 2018, none of those funds were restricted, and approximately 87% of those funds were located in the u.s. our unsecured revolving credit facility is available to us for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions and share repurchases. at july 31, 2018, no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility. see note 8 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information.
we evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies. our strong liquidity profile enables us to respond nimbly to these kinds of opportunities.
based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, commitments, debt service requirements, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months. we expect to return excess cash generated by operations to our stockholders through repurchases of our common stock and payment of cash dividends, after taking into account our operating and strategic cash needs.
statements of cash flows the following table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash flows for fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, and fiscal 2016. see the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for complete statements of cash flows for those periods.

tables of contents repurchase programs, $363 million for the acquisitions of businesses net of cash acquired, and $124 million for capital expenditures.
during fiscal 2017 we generated $1.6 billion in cash from operations. we also received $190 million in cash from net sales of investments, $150 million from borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and $73 million from the net issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. during the same period we used $662 million in cash for the repayment of debt and amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility, $839 million for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, $353 million for the payment of cash dividends, and $230 million for capital expenditures.
during fiscal 2016 we generated $1.5 billion in cash from operations. we also received $500 million in proceeds from our term loan, $463 million from the sales of our demandforce, quickbase, and quicken businesses, $418 million from net sales of investments, and $89 million in cash from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. during the same period we used $2.3 billion in cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, $318 million for the payment of cash dividends, and $522 million for capital expenditures, including the purchase of certain previously leased facilities.
stock repurchase programs and dividends on common stock as described in note 11 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report, during fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, and fiscal 2016 we continued to repurchase shares of our common stock under a series of repurchase programs that our board of directors has authorized. at july 31, 2018, we had authorization from our board of directors to expend up to an additional $1.2 billion for stock repurchases. on august 21, 2018 our board approved a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional $2 billion of our common stock, bringing the total authorization to $3.2 billion.
during fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, and fiscal 2016 we also continued to pay quarterly cash dividends on shares of our outstanding common stock. in august 2018 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.47 per share of outstanding common stock payable on october 18, 2018 to stockholders of records at the close of business on october 10, 2018. we currently expect to continue paying comparable cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however, future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record dates and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our board of directors.
business combinations during fiscal 2018 we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of tsheets.com llc, exactor, inc., and applatix, inc. for total combined cash and other consideration of approximately $412 million. the $412 million included approximately $27 million for the fair value of equity awards and other cash consideration that is being charged to expense over the future service period of up to three years. these three businesses became part of our small business & self-employed segment and will provide additional features to our quickbooks offerings such as automated time tracking and scheduling and the calculation and filing of sales and use taxes. we have included their results of operations in our consolidated results of operations from the dates of acquisition. their results of operations for all periods presented and periods prior to the dates of acquisition were not material when compared with our consolidated results of operations. see note 6 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information.
credit facility on february 1, 2016 we entered into a master credit agreement with certain institutional lenders for a five-year credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion. the master credit agreement includes a $500 million unsecured term loan and a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on february 1, 2021. under the master credit agreement we may, subject to certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the revolving credit facility in an amount not to exceed $250 million in the aggregate and may extend the maturity date up to two times. advances under the revolving credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either bank of america's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.5% or the london interbank offered rate (libor) plus a margin that ranges from 0.9% to 1.5%. actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings. at july 31, 2018, no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility. we monitor counterparty risk associated with the institutional lenders that are providing the credit facility. we currently believe that the credit facility will be available to us should we choose to borrow under it.
under the master credit agreement, we borrowed $500 million in the form of an unsecured term loan on february 1, 2016. we may, subject to certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the term loan in an amount not to exceed $500 million in the aggregate. the term loan accrues interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either bank of america's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.125% to 0.875% or libor plus a margin that ranges from 1.125% to 1.875%. actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings. the term loan is subject to quarterly principal payments of 2.5% of the loan amount which began in july 2017, with the balance payable on february 1, 2021. at july 31, 2018, $438 million was outstanding under the term loan.
tables of contents the master credit agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain a ratio of total debt to annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00 as of any date and a ratio of annual ebitda to annual interest expense of not less than 3.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. we remained in compliance with these covenants at all times during the quarter ended july 31, 2018.
cash held by foreign subsidiaries our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.7 billion at july 31, 2018. approximately 13% of those funds were held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to repatriation tax considerations. these foreign funds were located primarily in canada and india. as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act we do not expect to pay incremental u.s. taxes on repatriation. we have recorded income tax expense for canada and india withholding and distribution taxes on earnings that are not permanently reinvested. in the event that funds from foreign operations are repatriated to the united states, we would pay withholding or distribution taxes at that time.
off-balance sheet arrangements at july 31, 2018, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of regulation s-k.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our known contractual obligations to make future payments at july 31, 2018:

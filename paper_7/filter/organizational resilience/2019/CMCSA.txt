2019 consolidated operating results by segment(a)
(a)   charts exclude the results of nbcuniversal headquarters and other, corporate and other, and eliminations.
2019 developments the following are the more significant developments in our businesses during 2019:
•   revenue increased 3.7% to $58.1 billion, reflecting increases in high-speed internet, business services and wireless revenue, partially offset by declines in advertising, video and voice revenue
•   operating margin increased from 38.7% to 40.1%, reflecting increases in revenue from high-speed internet and business services and decreases in losses in our wireless business, partially offset by higher technical and product support expenses
•   capital expenditures decreased 10.5% to $6.9 billion, reflecting lower spending on scalable infrastructure and customer premise equipment, partially offset by an increase in support capital nbcuniversal segments
•   broadcast television and cable networks segments revenue decreased 10.3% to $10.3 billion and 2.2% to $11.5 billion, respectively, reflecting the impact of our broadcasts of the 2018 pyeongchang olympics and 2018 super bowl; excluding revenue associated with the 2018 pyeongchang olympics and 2018 super bowl, cable networks and broadcast television segments revenue increased 1.0% and 0.1%, respectively, with the increase in cable networks primarily due to increases in distribution revenue, partially offset by decreases in content licensing revenue
•   filmed entertainment segment revenue decreased 9.2% to $6.5 billion, reflecting lower theatrical, home entertainment and other revenue, partially offset by an increase in content licensing
•   theme parks segment revenue increased 4.4% to $5.9 billion, reflecting increased guest spending and higher attendance in 2019 due, in part, to natural disasters that negatively impacted attendance in japan in 2018
•   sky's results of operations for the full year 2019 are included in our consolidated results, with revenue of $19.2 billion and adjusted ebitda of $3.1 billion
•   on a pro forma basis, sky revenue decreased 3.0% to $19.2 billion. excluding the impact of foreign currency, pro forma sky revenue increased 1.7% primarily due to increases in content and direct-to-consumer revenues, partially offset by a decrease in advertising revenue
•   on a pro forma basis, sky adjusted ebitda increased 7.1% to $3.1 billion. excluding the impact of foreign currency, pro forma sky adjusted ebitda increased 12.2% primarily due to contract termination costs and costs related to a settlement in the prior year period.
•   corporate and other revenue decreased 35.0% to $333 million primarily due to the sale of a controlling interest in our arena management-related businesses in the second quarter of 2018
•   corporate and other adjusted ebitda losses increased 12.9% to $880 million primarily due to costs associated with the development of peacock
•   announced peacock, our direct-to-consumer streaming service that will feature nbcuniversal content, which is expected to be launched in 2020
•   entered into a series of agreements in may 2019 with disney, whereby disney assumed full operational control of hulu, llc ("hulu") in exchange for certain put and call provisions regarding our ownership interest, and in august 2019, we received proceeds of $5.2 billion from a collateralized obligation secured by the proceeds guaranteed under the put and call provisions
•   repaid $15.6 billion of debt, including senior notes and term loans, and net repayments of commercial paper, which were funded with cash on hand, proceeds from the collateralized obligation related to hulu and proceeds from the $4.8 billion issuance of senior notes in november 2019
competition the results of operations of our reportable business segments are affected by competition, as all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services, and entertainment, news and information content to consumers. technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and challenging existing business models. in particular, consumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content, which has and likely will continue to reduce the number of our video customers and subscribers to our cable networks even as it makes high-speed internet services more important to consumers. in addition, the increasing number of entertainment choices available to consumers has intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally has been viewed by consumers. this increase has caused and likely will continue to cause audience ratings declines at our programming channels.
for additional information on the competition our businesses face, see item 1: business and item 1a: risk factors. within the business section, refer to the "competition" discussion, and within the risk factors section, refer to the risk factors entitled "our businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively." and "changes in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models."
seasonality and cyclicality each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. see item 1: business and refer to the "seasonality and cyclicality" discussion within that section for additional information.

the comparability of our consolidated results of operations was impacted by the sky transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018. sky's results of operations are included in our consolidated financial statements following the october 9, 2018 acquisition date.
the primary drivers of the change in revenue from 2018 to 2019 were as follows:
•   our acquisition of sky in the fourth quarter of 2018, resulting in the inclusion of a full year of results for 2019
•   growth in our cable communications segment driven by increased revenue from residential high-speed internet, business services and wireless, partially offset by decreased revenue from advertising, video and voice
•   a decrease in nbcuniversal revenue primarily due to the absence of revenue associated with our broadcasts of the 2018 pyeongchang olympics and the 2018 super bowl revenue for our segments and other businesses are discussed separately below under the heading "segment operating results."
consolidated costs and expenses the following graph illustrates the contributions to the increases in consolidated operating costs and expenses, representing total costs and expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense and other operating gains, made by our cable communications, nbcuniversal and sky segments, as well as by corporate and other activities, including eliminations.
the primary drivers of the change in operating costs and expenses from 2018 to 2019 were as follows:
•   our acquisition of sky in the fourth quarter of 2018, resulting in the inclusion of a full year of results for 2019
•   a decrease in nbcuniversal programming and production expenses primarily due to the absence of expenses associated with our broadcasts of the 2018 pyeongchang olympics and the 2018 super bowl
•   an increase in technical and product support costs in our cable communications segment operating costs and expenses for our segments and our corporate operations, business development initiatives and other businesses are discussed separately below under the heading "segment operating results."
consolidated depreciation and amortization expense year ended december 31 (in millions)        2019              2018              2017             % change             % change percentage changes that are considered not meaningful are denoted with nm.
consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2019 primarily due to the acquisition of sky in the fourth quarter of 2018, with a full year of expense included in our results of operations for 2019. additionally, during the first quarter of 2019, we recorded adjustments to the purchase price allocation of sky, primarily related to intangible assets and property and equipment. this change resulted in an adjustment recorded in the first quarter of 2019 related to the fourth quarter of 2018 that increased depreciation and amortization expense by $53 million.
36      comcast 2019 annual report on form 10-k cable communications depreciation and amortization expense decreased due to lower spending on scalable infrastructure and customer premise equipment, partially offset by an increase in support capital. nbcuniversal depreciation and amortization expense was flat in 2019.
amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets, such as customer relationships, totaled $2.0 billion, $1.1 billion and $824 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. amounts primarily relate to customer relationship intangible assets recorded in connection with the sky transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018 (see note 8 to comcast's consolidated financial statements) and the nbcuniversal transaction in 2011.
consolidated other operating gains consolidated other operating gains for 2018 included $200 million related to the sale of a controlling interest in our arena management-related businesses in corporate and other (see note 10 to comcast's consolidated financial statements) and $141 million related to the sale of a business in our filmed entertainment segment.
consolidated interest expense interest expense increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to increases in our debt outstanding associated with the financing of and debt assumed in connection with the sky transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018, as well as a $56 million charge related to the early redemption of debt that was recorded in the third quarter of 2019.
equity in net income (losses) of investees, net                      $(505   )     $(364   )      $107
equity in net income (losses) of investees, net the change in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to our equity method investments in hulu and atairos group, inc. ("atairos"). the losses at hulu were primarily due to programming, advertising and marketing costs, and higher other administrative expenses. atairos follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of income. we recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. the income (losses) at atairos were driven by fair value adjustments on its underlying investments. the table below summarizes the equity in net income (losses) of hulu and atairos in 2019, 2018 and 2017.
realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net the change in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to gains of $293 million related to our interest in snap, which was sold in 2019, compared to losses of $268 million in 2018, and unrealized gains of $184 million related to our investment in peloton interactive, inc. ("peloton").
other income (loss), net the change in other income (loss), net in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to the recognition of $219 million of gains related to the dilution of our hulu ownership and $90 million of losses due to the impairment of an equity method investment. see note 10 to comcast's consolidated financial statements and note 9 to nbcuniversal's consolidated financial statements for further information.
comcast 2019 annual report on form 10-k consolidated income tax (expense) benefit income tax (expense) benefit reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and foreign income taxes and adjustments associated with uncertain tax positions. our effective income tax rate in 2019 and 2018 was 21.6% and 22.2%, respectively.
in 2019, the effective income tax rate included $125 million of benefits related to state income tax adjustments recognized in the third quarter of 2019.
in 2018, the effective income tax rate included the effects of an income tax benefit of $244 million recognized during the fourth quarter of 2018 related to a reduction of our net deferred tax liability as a result of the acquisition of sky and $128 million recognized during the first quarter of 2018 related to the enactment of additional federal tax legislation in 2018, partially offset by $148 million of income tax expense due to state and federal tax law changes that were enacted in the third quarter of 2018.
consolidated net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock the increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to an increase in the redemption value of one of our noncontrolling interests.
segment operating results our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information. we use adjusted ebitda as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. adjusted ebitda is defined as net income attributable to comcast corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. from time to time we may exclude from adjusted ebitda the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. adjusted ebitda for our segments is not a non-gaap financial measure. we reconcile the aggregate amount of adjusted ebitda for our reportable business segments to consolidated income before income taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements (see note 2 to comcast's consolidated financial statements and nbcuniversal's consolidated financial statements).
beginning in the first quarter of 2019, comcast cable's wireless phone service and certain other cable-related business development initiatives are presented in the cable communications segment. results were previously presented in corporate and other. prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this presentation.

customer metrics are presented based on actual amounts. minor differences may exist due to rounding. customer relationships represent the number of residential and business customers that subscribe to at least one of our services. one product, two product, and three or more product customers represent residential customers that subscribe to one, two, or three or more of our services, respectively. for mdus, including buildings located on college campuses, whose residents have the ability to receive additional services, such as additional programming choices or our hd or dvr services, we count and report customers based on the number of potential billable relationships within each mdu. for mdus whose residents are not able to receive additional services, the mdu is counted as a single customer. residential high-speed internet and video customers as of december 31, 2019 included prepaid customers totaling approximately 196,000 and 7,000, respectively. wireless lines represent the number of activated eligible wireless devices on customers' accounts. individual customer relationships may have multiple wireless lines.
average monthly total revenue per customer relationship       $156.24         $156.23         $153.60
average monthly adjusted ebitda per customer relationship      $62.59          $60.45          $59.13
average monthly total revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business services customers, as well as changes in advertising revenue. while revenue from our residential high-speed internet, video and voice services are also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle, the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship.
each of our services has a different contribution to operating margin. we use average monthly adjusted ebitda per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings. we believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses, including residential high-speed internet and business services.
cable communications segment - revenue we are a leading provider of high-speed internet, video, voice, wireless, and security and automation services to residential customers in the united states under the xfinity brand; we also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising. we generate revenue primarily from residential and business customers that subscribe to our services, which we market individually and as bundled services. we also generate revenue from selling through our allocation of scheduled advertising time on cable networks that is received as part of distribution agreements with these networks to local, regional and national advertisers.
comcast 2019 annual report on form 10-k high-speed internet we offer high-speed internet services with downstream speeds that range up to 1 gigabit per second ("gbps") and fiber-based speeds that range up to 2 gbps. we also deploy wireless gateways to customers that combine an internet and voice modem with a wi-fi router to deliver reliable internet speeds and enhanced coverage through an in-and-out-of-home wi-fi network. customers with xfi-enabled wireless gateways may also personalize and manage their wi-fi network remotely, which includes viewing and changing their wi-fi password, identifying which devices are connected to their in-home network, setting parental controls and schedules, advanced security, as well as other features. we believe our customer base will continue to grow as consumers choose our high-speed internet service and seek higher-speed offerings.
revenue increased in 2019 primarily due to an increase in the number of residential high-speed internet customers. the remaining increase in revenue in 2019 was due to an increase in average rates.

average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by sky's customers. each of sky's services has a different contribution to adjusted ebitda.
sky segment - revenue direct-to-consumer revenue is derived from subscription and transactional revenue from residential and business customers. subscription revenue includes revenue from residential and business subscribers to video, high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services, including ott subscriptions and income from set-top boxes, wireless phone handset and tablet sales, installation, service calls and warranties. transactional revenue includes the purchase of physical and digital content, ott daily and weekly passes, and pay-per-view programming.
revenue decreased in 2019 compared to 2018. excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue increased primarily due to increases in customer relationships, partially offset by decreases in average revenue per customer relationship.
content revenue is derived from the distribution of sky's owned television channels on third-party platforms and the licensing of owned and acquired programming to third-party video providers.
revenue increased in 2019 compared to 2018. excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue increased reflecting the wholesaling of sports programming, including exclusive sports rights acquired in italy and germany and the monetization of sky's slate of original programming.
advertising revenue is derived from the sale of advertising and sponsorships across sky's owned television channels and where it represents the sales efforts of third-party channels.
revenue decreased in 2019 compared to 2018. excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue decreased reflecting the impact of changes in legislation related to gambling advertisements in the u.k. and italy that occurred in the third quarter of 2019, as well as overall market weakness.
sky segment - operating costs and expenses programming and production costs expenses primarily relate to content originating on sky's channels. these costs include the amortization of owned and acquired programming costs, sports rights, direct production costs, residual and participation payments, production overhead, and on-air talent costs. these expenses also include the fees associated with programming distribution agreements for channels owned by third parties, which are generally based on the number of customers who are able to watch the programming and the platforms on which the content is provided.
expenses were flat in 2019 compared to 2018. excluding the impact of foreign currency, expenses increased primarily due to an increase in the cost of sports programming contracts.
direct network costs expenses primarily include costs directly related to the supply of high-speed internet and voice services, including wireless phone services, to sky's customers. this includes call costs, monthly wholesale access fees and other variable costs associated with sky's network. in addition, it includes the cost of mobile handsets sold to customers.
expenses increased in 2019 compared to 2018. excluding the impact of foreign currency, expenses increased primarily due to increases in costs associated with sky's wireless phone service as a result of increases in the number of customers receiving the service.
comcast 2019 annual report on form 10-k other expenses expenses include costs related to marketing, fees paid to third-party channels where sky represents the advertising sales efforts, subscriber management, supply chain, transmission, technology, fixed networks and general administrative costs.
expenses decreased in 2019 compared to 2018. excluding the impact of foreign currency, expenses decreased primarily due to contract termination costs and costs related to a settlement in the prior year, and a favorable settlement in the current year.
we anticipate that expenses will increase in 2020 compared to 2019 due to the launch of high-speed internet service in italy, as well as continued acceleration of sky q across all of our markets.

percentage changes that are considered not meaningful are denoted with nm.
revenue decreased in 2019 primarily due to the sale of a controlling interest in our arena management-related businesses in the second quarter of 2018.
corporate and other - operating costs and expenses expenses primarily include overhead, personnel costs, the costs of other business initiatives, such as the development of peacock and operating costs and expenses associated with comcast spectacor.
expenses decreased in 2019 primarily due to costs directly related to the sky transaction and a legal settlement in the prior year, as well as the absence of costs associated with our arena management-related businesses. the decrease was partially offset by an increase in other costs associated with the sky transaction, including expenses resulting from the replacement of share-based compensation awards and costs related to integration activities, as well as start up costs associated with peacock. corporate and other adjusted ebitda excludes sky transaction-related costs and costs associated with a legal settlement.
we plan to launch peacock in 2020 and expect to incur significant costs to develop and scale our direct-to-consumer streaming service.
non-gaap financial measures consolidated adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is a non-gaap financial measure and is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our businesses. this measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. it is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures, and by our investment activities, including the results of entities that we do not consolidate, as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance. our management and board of directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. it is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. additionally, we believe that adjusted ebitda is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
we define adjusted ebitda as net income attributable to comcast corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related comcast 2019 annual report on form 10-k   51
to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. from time to time we may exclude from adjusted ebitda the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance.
we reconcile consolidated adjusted ebitda to net income attributable to comcast corporation. this measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to comcast corporation, or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with gaap.

constant currency constant currency and constant currency growth rates are non-gaap financial measures that present our results of operations excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. certain of our businesses, including sky, have operations outside the united states that are conducted in local currencies. as a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in u.s. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. in our sky segment, we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the business, and we believe it is helpful for investors to present operating results on a comparable basis year over year to evaluate its underlying performance.
constant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the prior year results adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from the current year rather than the actual exchange rates that were in effect during the respective prior year.

52      comcast 2019 annual report on form 10-k liquidity and capital resources our businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities. we believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing credit facilities; and our ability to obtain future external financing. we anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows in repaying our debt obligations, funding our capital expenditures, investing in business opportunities and returning capital to shareholders.
we maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facilities and our commercial paper programs to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. our commercial paper programs provide a lower-cost source of borrowing to fund our short-term working capital requirements. see note 7 to comcast's consolidated financial statements for additional information on our revolving credit facilities. as of december 31, 2019, amounts available under our revolving credit facilities, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper programs and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $9.2 billion.
comcast, nbcuniversal and comcast cable are subject to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing our public debt securities and in the credit agreements governing the comcast revolving credit facility. the financial covenant in the credit facility pertains to leverage, which is the ratio of debt to ebitda, as defined in the credit facility. we test for compliance with this financial covenant on an ongoing basis. as of december 31, 2019, we met this financial covenant by a significant margin. we do not expect to have to reduce debt or improve operating results in order to continue to comply with this financial covenant. in addition, the universal studios japan term loans contain certain financial covenants. as of december 31, 2019, universal studios japan was in compliance with all of these covenants.

the variance in changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily related to the timing of film and television costs and our broadcast of the 2018 super bowl at nbcuniversal, partially offset by the timing of collections on receivables and our broadcast of the 2018 pyeongchang olympics.
the increase in interest payments in 2019 was primarily due to higher levels of debt outstanding, including the issuance of new debt in 2018 associated with the financing of the sky transaction.
the increase in income tax payments in 2019 was primarily due to reduced tax payments in 2018 as a result of federal income tax overpayments in 2017.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities in 2019 consisted primarily of capital expenditures, purchases of investments, cash paid for intangible assets and the construction of universal beijing resort. net cash used in investing activities in 2018 consisted primarily of cash paid for acquisitions, cash paid for capital expenditures, cash paid for intangible assets and purchase of investments.
capital expenditures capital expenditures increased in 2019 primarily due to the acquisition of sky in the fourth quarter of 2018, with a full year of capital expenditures for 2019. sky capital expenditures totaled $768 million in 2019, reflecting the continued deployment of sky q and high-speed internet services.
capital expenditures in our nbcuniversal segments increased 19.7% to $2.1 billion in 2019 primarily due to an increase in spending at our universal theme parks, including construction of an additional theme park in orlando, florida.
our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures in our cable communications segment, and we expect that this will continue in the future. cable communications' capital expenditures decreased 10.5% in 2019 compared to comcast 2019 annual report on form 10-k   53
2018 primarily due to lower spending on scalable infrastructure and customer premise equipment. the table below summarizes the capital expenditures we incurred in our cable communications segment in 2019, 2018 and 2017.

we expect our capital expenditures for 2020 will be focused on the continued investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity in our cable communications segment; increased investment in line extensions for the expansion of both business services and residential; and the continued deployment of wireless gateways, our x1 platform, cloud dvr technology, sky q, and international ott platforms. in addition, we expect to continue to invest in existing and new attractions at our universal theme parks, including the additional theme park being constructed in orlando, florida. capital expenditures for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors, including acquisitions, competition, changes in technology, regulatory changes, the timing and rate of deployment of new services, the capacity required for existing services, and the timing of new attractions at our theme parks.
cash paid for intangible assets in 2019, cash paid for intangible assets increased primarily due to the acquisition of sky in the fourth quarter of 2018, with a full year of expense included in our results of operations for 2019, and to a lesser extent, expenditures for software in our cable communications segment. our sky segment's cash paid for intangible assets totaled $707 million in 2019 and consisted primarily of expenditures for software development related to sky q and high-speed internet services. in 2018, cash paid for intangible assets consisted primarily of expenditures for software in our cable communication segment, and to a lesser extent, expenditures for software in our nbcuniversal segments.
acquisitions and construction of real estate properties acquisitions and construction of real estate properties primarily included the construction of the comcast technology center in philadelphia, pennsylvania, which was completed in 2019.
construction of universal beijing resort construction of universal beijing resort includes costs related to the construction of the universal theme park and resort in beijing, china. see note 8 to comcast's consolidated financial statements and note 7 to nbcuniversal's consolidated financial statements for further information on universal beijing resort.
purchases of investments purchases of investments in 2019 and 2018 were primarily related to capital contributions to hulu and atairos.
other other investing activities in 2019 were primarily related to distributions received from equity method investments. other investing activities in 2018 were primarily related to proceeds received from the sale of an investment and proceeds from the settlement of derivative contracts.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities in 2019 consisted primarily of repayments of debt, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock under our employee plans, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of senior notes and a collateralized obligation. net cash provided by financing activities in 2018 consisted primarily of proceeds from borrowings, including the financing of the sky acquisition, partially offset by repayments of debt, repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and employee plans, and dividend payments.
in 2019, we made debt repayments of $14.4 billion, including $6.1 billion of optional repayments of term loans due 2021 to 2023, $5.2 billion of senior notes due 2020 and $3.0 billion of senior notes due 2019.
in august 2019, we received proceeds of approximately $5.2 billion under a term loan facility due 2024 which is presented as a collateralized obligation, the principal amount of which is fully secured by the minimum guaranteed proceeds under the put/call provisions related to our investment in hulu. in november 2019, we issued $1.6 billion of senior notes due 2030, $1.35 billion of senior notes due 2039 and $1.8 billion of senior notes due 2050. the proceeds from the collateralized obligation and the senior notes were used to repay debt. in 2019, we made borrowings of $728 million under the universal beijing resort term loan.
comcast 2019 annual report on form 10-k in 2019, we made net repayments of $673 million under our commercial paper programs and made net repayments of $615 million under sky's £1 billion revolving credit facility, which was terminated in february 2019.
in december 2019, we announced our election to exercise our option to redeem at par $1.49 billion of senior notes due 2046 in february 2020.
we have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. see note 7 to comcast's consolidated financial statements and note 6 to nbcuniversal's consolidated financial statements for additional information on our financing activities.
share repurchases and dividends effective january 1, 2017, our board of directors increased our share repurchase program authorization to $12 billion, which does not have an expiration date. as of december 31, 2019, $2 billion remained under this authorization. under the authorization, we may repurchase shares in the open market or in private transactions. we have paused our share repurchase program in order to accelerate the reduction of indebtedness we incurred in connection with the acquisition of sky, and no common shares were repurchased in 2019 under the authorization. under our share repurchase program authorization, we repurchased a total of 140 million shares of class a common stock for $5.0 billion in 2018, and 131 million shares of class a common stock for $5.0 billion in 2017.
our board of directors declared quarterly dividends totaling $3.9 billion in 2019. we paid dividends of $3.7 billion in 2019. in january 2020, our board of directors approved a 10% increase in our dividend to $0.92 per share on an annualized basis. we expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our board of directors.
the chart below summarizes our dividends paid in 2019, 2018 and 2017. in addition, we paid $504 million and $320 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans.

(c)   purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are legally binding on us and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and price provisions. our purchase obligations related to cable communications and sky include programming contracts with cable networks and local broadcast television stations; contracts with customer premise equipment manufacturers; contracts with communications vendors and multichannel video providers for which we provide advertising sales representation; contracts to acquire handsets and other equipment; and other contracts entered into in the normal course of business. cable communications' and sky's programming contracts include amounts payable under fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments and do not represent the total fees that are expected to be paid under programming contracts, which we expect to be significantly higher because these contracts are generally based on the number of subscribers receiving the programming. our purchase obligations related to nbcuniversal and sky include commitments to acquire film and television programming, and broadcast rights relating to sporting events, such as the olympics, as well as obligations under various creative talent agreements, including obligations to actors, producers and television personalities, and various other television commitments. purchase obligations do not include contracts with immaterial future commitments.
(d)   other long-term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet consist primarily of mandatorily redeemable subsidiary preferred shares; deferred compensation obligations; and postretirement, pension and postemployment benefit obligations. a contractual obligation with a carrying value of $1.1 billion is not included in the table above because it is uncertain if the arrangement will be settled. the contractual obligation involves an interest held by a third party in the revenue of certain theme parks. the arrangement provides the counterparty with the right to periodic payments associated with current period revenue and, beginning in june 2017, the option to require nbcuniversal to purchase the interest for cash in an amount based on a contractual formula. the contractual formula is based on an average of specified historical theme park revenue at the time of exercise, which amount could be significantly higher than the carrying value. as of december 31, 2019, the value of the contractual obligation was $1.8 billion, based on inputs to the contractual formula as of that date. see note 17 to comcast's consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this arrangement. liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $1.0 billion and the associated interest and penalties are not included in the table above because it is uncertain if or when these amounts will become payable. our total recorded liability of $2.7 billion related to participations and residuals are also not included in the table above because we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which these obligations will be settled.
(e)   our contractual obligations do not include our commitment to invest up to $5 billion at any one time as an investor in atairos due to our inability to estimate the timing of this funding. as of december 31, 2019, our remaining commitment is $2.2 billion based on the capital calls received as of that date (see note 10 to comcast's consolidated financial statements).
(f)   total contractual obligations are made up of the following components.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2019, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 9 to comcast's consolidated financial statements and note 8 to nbcuniversal's consolidated financial statements for additional information related to recent accounting pronouncements, including the impact of the adoption of the updated accounting guidance related to leases.
comcast 2019 annual report on form 10-k critical accounting judgments and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. we base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights, the accounting for film and television costs, and the valuation of acquisition-related assets and liabilities are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors, and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them, which are presented below. see notes 4, 8 and 12 to comcast's consolidated financial statements.
valuation and impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights we assess the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including cable franchise rights, annually, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. the assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. a quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed.
goodwill goodwill results from business combinations and represents the excess amount of the consideration paid over the identifiable assets and liabilities recorded in the acquisition. we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and have concluded that our reporting units are generally the same as our reportable segments. we evaluate the determination of our reporting units periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur. when performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our reporting units primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including market participant estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the business and the selection of discount rates. when analyzing the fair values indicated under discounted cash flow models, we also consider multiples of adjusted ebitda generated by the underlying assets, current market transactions and profitability information.
we performed a qualitative assessment for our reporting units in 2019. this assessment considered changes in our projected future cash flows and discount rates, recent market transactions and overall macroeconomic conditions. based on this assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were higher than their carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required. assets and liabilities resulting from a business combination are initially recorded at fair value and the risk of goodwill impairment is reduced as the value of the businesses in a reporting unit increases and as the carrying value of the reporting unit decreases due to the amortization of the historical cost of acquired long-lived assets over time. goodwill in our cable communications segment and our nbcuniversal segments has resulted from the combination of legacy businesses and newly acquired businesses and as a result, the fair values of the reporting units are significantly in excess of the respective carrying values. the goodwill in our sky segment resulted from our acquisition of sky in the fourth quarter of 2018. given this was a recent transaction, the fair value is in close proximity to the carrying value of the sky reporting unit.
changes in market conditions, laws and regulations, and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments, including expected cash flows, competitive factors and discount rates, could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge.
cable franchise rights our cable franchise rights assets result from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area. the value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market additional services in a particular service area. the amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions. typically when we acquire a cable system, the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights. often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas. we currently serve approximately 6,400 franchise areas in the united states.
we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows. accordingly, we do not amortize our cable franchise rights.
comcast 2019 annual report on form 10-k for purposes of our impairment testing, we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our three cable communications divisions or units of account. we evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level.
when performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including the estimate of future cash flows and the selection of discount rates. when analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models, we also consider multiples of adjusted ebitda generated by the underlying assets, current market transactions and profitability information.
in 2019, we performed a qualitative assessment of our cable franchise rights. at the time of our previous quantitative assessment in 2018, the estimated fair values of our franchise rights exceeded the carrying value of the northeast, central and west divisions by 29%, 46% and 58%, respectively. we also considered various factors that would affect the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights in our qualitative assessment, including changes in our projected future cash flows associated with our cable communications segment; market transactions and macroeconomic conditions; discount rates; and changes in our market capitalization. based on this assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights were higher than the carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required.
changes in market conditions, laws and regulations and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments, including expected cash flows, competitive factors and discount rates, could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge.
film and television costs we capitalize film and television production costs, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest. we amortize capitalized film and television production costs, including acquired libraries, and accrue costs associated with participation and residual payments to programming and production expenses. we generally record the amortization and the accrued costs using the individual film forecast computation method, which amortizes the costs using the ratio of the current period's revenue to estimated total remaining revenue from all sources ("ultimate revenue"). estimates of ultimate revenue have a significant impact on how quickly capitalized costs are amortized and, therefore, are updated regularly.
our estimates of ultimate revenue for films generally include revenue from all sources that are expected to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film's initial release. these estimates are based on the historical performance of similar content, as well as factors unique to the content itself. the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for a film intended for theatrical release is the film's theatrical performance, as subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of a film has historically exhibited a high correlation to its theatrical performance. upon a film's release, our estimates of revenue from succeeding markets, including from content licensing across multiple platforms and home entertainment sales, are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends.
with respect to television series or other owned television programming, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond its initial license. initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue contracted for each episode under the initial license. once it is determined that a television series or other owned television programming can be licensed for subsequent platforms, revenue estimates for these platforms, such as u.s. and international syndication, home entertainment, and other distribution platforms, are included in ultimate revenue. revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or, if still in production, 5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later.
we capitalize the costs of programming rights for content that we license but do not own at the earlier of when payments are made for the programming or when the license period begins and the content is made available for use. we amortize capitalized programming costs as the associated programs are broadcast. we recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports programming rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative value. estimated relative value is generally based on the ratio of the current period revenue to the estimated ultimate revenue or the terms of the contract. advance payments for rights to multiyear, live-event sports programming are included in programming rights.
capitalized film and television costs are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified. if the fair value of a production were to fall below its unamortized cost, we would record an adjustment for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the production's fair value. the fair value assessment is generally based on estimated future discounted cash flows, which are supported by our internal forecasts. adjustments to capitalized film production costs were not material in any of the periods presented.
comcast 2019 annual report on form 10-k fair value of acquisition-related assets and liabilities we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values. in determining fair value, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts. management's estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain. as part of the estimation process, third-party valuation specialists are engaged to assist in the valuation of certain of these assets and liabilities.
our judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives and depreciation and amortization methods, have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. for instance, the determination of asset lives impacts our results of operations as different types of assets have different useful lives and certain assets may be considered to have indefinite useful lives.
intangible assets intangible assets primarily consist of our estimates of fair value for finite-lived customer relationships and indefinite-lived trade names.
customer relationships were valued using a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including the estimate of future cash flows and the selection of discount rates. this measure of fair value also requires considerable judgments about future events, including attrition, contract renewal estimates and technology changes.
in determining the estimated lives and method of amortization for finite-lived intangibles, we use a method and life that closely follows the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset.
trade names were valued using the relief-from-royalty method, a form of the income approach. this measure of fair value requires considerable judgment about the value a market participant would be willing to pay in order to achieve the benefits associated with the trade name.
property and equipment property and equipment includes customer premise equipment as well as network assets, real estate, and other machinery and equipment.
property and equipment was valued using the reproduction and replacement cost approaches as well as a cost approach for real estate. the reproduction and replacement cost approaches measure the value of an asset by estimating the cost to acquire or construct comparable assets and adjust for the age and condition of the asset. the cost approach measures the value of real estate through an evaluation of recent, comparable transactions or current listings of available properties.
contractual obligations contractual obligations were adjusted to market rates using a combination of discounted cash flows and market assumptions, when available.

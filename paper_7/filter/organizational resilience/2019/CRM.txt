("tableau") for $14.8 billion in common stock issued, cash and fair value of equity assumed, clicksoftware technologies ltd. ("clicksoftware") for $1.4 billion in cash, common stock issued and fair value of equity assumed, and salesforce.org for $300 million in cash.
•revenue: total fiscal 2020 revenue was $17.1 billion, an increase of 29 percent year-over-year. total fiscal 2020 revenues included approximately $228 million and $689 million of revenues from salesforce.org and tableau, respectively.
•earnings per share: fiscal 2020 diluted earnings per share was $0.15, as compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.43 from a year ago.
•cash: total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities ended the fiscal year at $7.9 billion. cash provided by operations for fiscal 2020 was $4.3 billion, an increase of 27 percent year-over-year.
•remaining performance obligation: remaining performance obligation ended the fiscal year at approximately $30.8 billion, an increase of 20 percent year-over-year. our remaining performance obligation includes approximately $450 million and $650 million related to the salesforce.org business combination in june 2019 and the tableau acquisition in august 2019, respectively. current remaining performance obligation ended the fiscal year at approximately $15.0 billion, an increase of 26 percent year-over-year.
we continue to invest for future growth through focusing on multi-cloud adoption by our existing customers, growing our relationships with our enterprise customers, expanding internationally and expanding and strengthening our ecosystem of partners and independent software vendors ("isvs"). as a result, we continue to win customers from competitors in the markets in which we compete. in addition, we continue to expand in the growing addressable markets across all of our service offerings providing additional opportunities for growth in our business and results.
we regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings through a disciplined and thoughtful acquisition process. we expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. as part of our business and growth strategy, we are delivering innovative solutions in new categories, including analytics and integration. we drive innovation organically and to a lesser extent through acquisitions, such as our recent business combination with salesforce.org in june 2019 and acquisitions of tableau in august 2019 and clicksoftware in october 2019.
as a result of our aggressive growth plans and integration of our previously acquired businesses, we have incurred significant expenses for equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles, which have reduced our operating income.
we periodically make changes to our sales organization to position us for long-term growth, which has in the past and could again in the future result in temporary disruptions to our sales productivity. in addition, we have experienced, and may at times in the future experience, more variation from our forecasted expectations of new business activity due to longer and less predictable sales cycles and increasing complexity of our business, which includes an expanded mix of products and various revenue models resulting from acquisitions. while we do not expect any of these changes to have a material adverse effect on our business or our ability to meet our near-term or long-term revenue targets, slower growth in new business in a given period could negatively affect our revenues in future periods, as well as remaining performance obligation in current or future periods, particularly if experienced on a sustained basis.
in december 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported in wuhan, china. the world health organization has declared the outbreak to constitute a "public health emergency of international concern." the extent of the impact of the coronavirus on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our customers and our sales cycles, impact on our customer, employee or industry events, and effect on our vendors, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. for example, in response to the coronavirus epidemic, we have shifted certain of our customer events to virtual-only experiences and we may deem it advisable to similarly alter, postpone or cancel entirely additional customer, employee or industry events in the future. at this point, the extent to which the coronavirus may impact our financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. due to our subscription based business model, the effect of the coronavirus may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods, if at all.
the expanding global scope of our business and the heightened volatility of global markets expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted our revenue results for fiscal 2020 and had a minimal impact on our remaining performance obligation as of january 31, 2020. we expect these fluctuations to continue in the future.
operating segments we operate as one segment. see note 1 "summary of business and significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements for our discussion about segments.
table of contents adoption of new accounting standards we adopted accounting standards update no. 2016-02, "leases (topic 842)" ("asu 2016-02"), also referred to as topic 842 at the beginning of fiscal 2020, and as a result, the consolidated balance sheet as of january 31, 2020 is not comparable with that of january 31, 2019. in addition, in fiscal 2019 we prospectively adopted accounting standards update no. 2016-01, "financial instrument-overall (subtopic 825-10)" ("asu 2016-01"). see note 1, "summary of business and significant accounting policies" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, which is incorporated herein by reference.
sources of revenues we derive our revenues from two sources: subscription and support revenues and related professional services. subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2020.
subscription and support revenues are primarily comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services (collectively, "cloud services"). with the may 2018 acquisition of mulesoft and the august 2019 acquisition of tableau, subscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with software licenses. software license revenues include fees from the sales of term and perpetual licenses. revenues from software licenses are generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the customer and revenues from the related support is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. revenues from software licenses represent less than ten percent of total subscription and support revenue for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018.
the revenue growth rates of each of our core service offerings, as described below in "results of operations", fluctuate from quarter to quarter and over time. additionally, we manage the total balanced product portfolio to deliver solutions to our customers, and as a result, the revenue result for each offering is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter. in addition, some of our cloud service offerings have similar features and functions. for example, customers may use the sales cloud, the service cloud or the salesforce platform to record account and contact information, which are similar features across these service offerings. depending on a customer's actual and projected business requirements, more than one service offering may satisfy the customer's current and future needs. we record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer, not according to the customer's business requirements and usage. in addition, as we introduce new features and functions within each offering and refine our allocation methodology for changes in our business, we do not expect it to be practical to adjust historical revenue results by service offering for comparability. accordingly, comparisons of revenue performance by service offering over time may not be meaningful.
seasonal nature of unearned revenue, accounts receivable and operating cash flow unearned revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. we generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or in revenue depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred. in general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. we typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. there is a disproportionate weighting toward annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. the year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is typically our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. conversely, our third quarter has historically been our smallest operating cash flow quarter.
the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related unearned revenue and operating cash flow during the first quarter of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs for the following quarters as displayed below (in millions):
table of contents remaining performance obligation our remaining performance obligation represents all future revenue under contract that has not yet been recognized as revenue and includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts. our current remaining performance obligation represents future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months.
remaining performance obligation is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth and is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, average contract terms, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in new business growth. unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates. for multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled balance and corresponding remaining performance obligation is typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increases if the agreement is renewed. low remaining performance obligation attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer.
remaining performance obligation consisted of the following (in billions):
(1) includes approximately $450 million and $650 million of remaining performance obligation related to the salesforce.org business combination in june 2019 and the tableau acquisition in august 2019, respectively.
(2) includes approximately $400 million and $550 million of remaining performance obligation related to the salesforce.org business combination in june 2019 and the tableau acquisition in august 2019, respectively.
(3) includes approximately $350 million of remaining performance obligation related to the salesforce.org business combination in june 2019.
cost of revenues and operating expenses impact of acquisitions the comparability of our operating results is impacted by our recent acquisitions, including the acquisition of tableau in august 2019. expense contributions by expense type from our recent acquisitions generally may not be separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses into our existing operations, or may be insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented.
cost of revenues cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to delivering our service and providing support, including the costs of data center capacity, certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data and employee-related costs such as salaries and benefits.
cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and certain third-party fees.
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses and allocated overhead.
marketing and sales marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses and commissions, for our sales and marketing staff, as well as payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities.
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel and professional services fees.
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in note 1 "summary of business and significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity.
revenue recognition - contracts with multiple performance obligations. we enter into contracts with our customers that may include promises to transfer multiple cloud services, software licenses, premium support and professional services. a performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct. determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment.
cloud services and software licenses are distinct as such offerings are often sold separately. in determining whether professional services are distinct, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription start date and the contractual dependence of the service on the customer's satisfaction with the professional services work. to date, we have concluded that professional services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are generally distinct.
we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price ("ssp") basis. the ssp is the price at which we would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer. judgment is required to determine the ssp for each distinct performance obligation. we determine ssp by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical sales and contract prices. in instances where we do not sell or price a product or service separately, we determine relative fair value using information that may include market conditions or other observable inputs. as our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to ssp.
in certain cases, we are able to establish ssp based on observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. we use a single amount to estimate ssp when it has observable prices. if ssp is not directly observable, for example when pricing is highly variable, we use a range of ssp. we determine the ssp range using information that may include pricing practices or other observable inputs. we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer size and geography.
costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts. costs capitalized related to new revenue contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over four years, which, although longer than the typical initial contract period, reflects the average period of benefit, including expected contract renewals. significant judgment is required in arriving at this average period of benefit. therefore, we evaluate both qualitative and quantitative factors which include the estimated life cycles of our offerings and our customer attrition.
business combinations. accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful lives of those acquired intangible assets.
examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to:
•future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;
•the acquired company's trade name and existing customer relationships, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name will continue to be used in our offerings;
•fair value of assumed equity awards; and
•fair value of pre-existing relationships.
table of contents unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
income taxes. valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character, for example, ordinary income or capital gains, within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and tax planning strategies. should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.
our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. the tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision.
strategic investments. accounting for strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.
valuations of privately held securities are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data and require the use of judgment. privately held debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. the carrying value is adjusted for our privately held equity securities if there are observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. in determining the estimated fair value of our strategic investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available. the determination of whether an orderly transaction is for a same or similar investment requires significant management judgment including the nature of rights and obligations of the investments, the extent to which differences in those rights and obligations would affect the fair values of those investments, and the impact of any differences based on the stage of operational development of the investee.
we assess our privately held debt and equity securities strategic investment portfolio quarterly for impairment. our impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative analyses of key factors including the investee's financial metrics, market acceptance of the product or technology, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. if the investment is considered to be impaired, we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statement of operations and establishing a new carrying value for the investment.

(3) amounts include a benefit related to the partial release of the valuation allowance of $612 million, and $2 million, for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. the fiscal 2019 benefit was partially offset by an increase in unrecognized tax benefits.
the following table sets forth selected balance sheet data and other metrics for each of the periods indicated (in millions, except remaining performance obligation, which is presented in billions):
as of january 31, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities               $7,947                      $4,342

(1) amounts do not include operating or financing lease obligations.
remaining performance obligation represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods.
impact of acquisitions the comparability of our operating results for the fiscal year ended january, 31 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended january 31, 2019 was impacted by our recent business combination and acquisitions, including the acquisition of tableau in august 2019, which has been our largest acquisition to date. in our discussion of changes in our results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, we may quantitatively disclose the impact of our acquired products and services for the one-year period subsequent to the acquisition date on the growth in certain of our revenues where such discussions would be meaningful. expense contributions from our recent acquisitions for each of the respective period comparisons generally were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses into our existing operations or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented.
(in millions)                                     2020                                2019                   dollars                 percent subscription and support                 $16,043                             $12,413                     $3,630                      29    %
professional services and other            1,055                                 869         186                                     21
the increase in subscription and support revenues was primarily caused by volume-driven increases from new business, which includes new customers, upgrades, additional subscriptions from existing customers and acquisition activity. pricing was not a significant driver of the increase in revenues for the period. revenues from term and perpetual software licenses, which are recognized at a point in time, represent approximately five percent of total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2020. subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent and 93 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively.
table of contents the business combination with salesforce.org in june 2019 and acquisition of tableau in august 2019 contributed approximately $217 million and $652 million to total subscription and support revenues in fiscal 2020, respectively. in addition, total revenues for fiscal 2020 benefited from a full twelve months of revenue from the acquisition of mulesoft in may 2018. as a result of our business combination activity, we recorded unearned revenue related to acquired contracts from acquired entities at fair value on the date of acquisition. as a result, we did not recognize certain revenues related to these acquired contracts that the acquired entities would have otherwise recorded as an independent entity.
our growth in revenues is also impacted by attrition. attrition represents the reduction or loss of the annualized value of our contracts with customers. we calculate our attrition rate at a point in time on a trailing twelve month basis as of the end of each month. as of january 31, 2020, our attrition rate, excluding commerce cloud, integration cloud, salesforce.org and tableau, was less than nine percent. our attrition rate for fiscal 2020 benefited, in part, from the ongoing shift in our business mix to enterprise and international markets which have longer customer contract term durations. in general, we exclude service offerings from acquisitions from our attrition calculation until fully integrated into our customer success organization. while it is difficult to predict, we expect our attrition rate to remain consistent as we continue to expand our enterprise business and invest in customer success and related programs.
we continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year. consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues. the increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers.
subscription and support revenue by service offering subscription and support revenues consisted of the following (in millions):
service cloud                           4,466                               3,621                   23%
marketing and commerce cloud            2,506                               1,898                   32%
subscription and support revenues from quip collaboration platform were not significant in fiscal 2020 and 2019. our industry offerings revenue is included in either sales cloud, service cloud or salesforce platform and other depending on the primary service offering purchased. integration and analytics revenues are included in salesforce platform and other. the acquisition of tableau in august 2019 contributed approximately $652 million to salesforce platform and other.
revenues by geography were as follows:
(in millions)                 2020                     as a % of total revenues                        2019                     as a % of total revenues                   growth rate americas               $12,051                                    71          %                  $9,445                                    71          %                      28     %
revenues by geography are determined based on the region of the salesforce contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the customer. the increase in revenues outside of the americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our services, our focus on marketing our services internationally and investment in additional international resources. revenues in the americas and europe also benefited from our acquisition of tableau in august 2019. foreign currency fluctuations, primarily the strengthening british pound sterling, had a negative impact on revenues outside of the americas of approximately $91 million in fiscal 2020 compared to a positive impact of approximately $39 million in fiscal 2019.

for fiscal 2020, the increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase of $245 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $43 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $213 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity and an increase of amortization of purchased intangible assets of $225 million. service delivery costs associated with perpetual and term software licenses is lower than our service delivery costs for our cloud service offerings and as a result, our subscription and support gross margin in fiscal 2020 benefited, in part, due to this shift in our business mix.
we have increased our headcount by 30 percent since fiscal 2019 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers, and our recent acquisitions also contributed to this increase. we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity to allow us to scale with our customers and continuously evolve our security measures. we also plan to add employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. the timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in future periods.
our professional services and other gross margin was positive $18 million during fiscal 2020 and positive $22 million during fiscal 2019. we expect the cost of professional services to be approximately in line with revenues from professional services in future fiscal quarters. we believe that this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings.

for fiscal 2020, the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase of approximately $561 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $203 million in stock-based expenses, an increase in our development and test data center costs and allocated overhead. our research and development headcount increased by 54 percent since fiscal 2019 in order to improve and extend our service offerings, develop new technologies, and integrate acquired companies. our recent acquisitions also contributed to this increase in headcount. we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to invest in additional employees and technology to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired technologies.
for fiscal 2020, the increase in marketing and sales expenses was primarily due to an increase of $1.1 billion in employee-related costs and amortization of deferred commissions, an increase of $209 million in stock-based expenses, an increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets of $120 million, and allocated overhead. our marketing and sales headcount increased by 36 percent since fiscal 2019, primarily attributable to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. our recent acquisitions also contributed to this increase in headcount. we expect that marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to hire additional sales personnel.
for fiscal 2020, the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs. our general and administrative headcount increased by 38 percent since fiscal 2019 as we added personnel to support our growth, and our recent acquisitions also contributed to this increase. we also incurred transaction costs associated with our table of contents various acquisitions during fiscal 2020, including approximately $40 million from tableau. during fiscal 2019, we incurred approximately $24 million of transaction costs from our acquisition of mulesoft in may 2019.
as a result of the june 2019 salesforce.org business combination, the company effectively settled all existing agreements between the company and salesforce.org and, as part of business combination accounting, accordingly recorded a one-time, non-cash operating expense charge of approximately $166 million related to the effective settlement of the reseller agreement.

gains on strategic investments, net consists primarily of mark-to-market adjustments related to our publicly held equity securities, observable price adjustments related to our privately held equity securities and other adjustments. net gains recognized during fiscal 2020 were primarily driven by unrealized gains recognized on privately held equity securities of $208 million and unrealized gains recognized on publicly traded securities of $138 million. in addition, net gains recognized during fiscal 2020 included gains of approximately $9 million and $39 million as a result of remeasuring our prior equity interest in mapanything and clicksoftware, respectively. net gains recognized during fiscal 2019 were primarily driven by unrealized gains recognized on publicly traded securities of $345 million.
other expense primarily consists of interest expense on our debt as well as our operating and finance leases offset by investment income. interest expense was $131 million and $154 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. investment income increased $61 million in fiscal 2020 compared to the same periods a year ago due to higher interest income across our portfolio, which is primarily a result of the larger cash equivalents and marketable securities balances.

in fiscal 2020, we recognized a tax provision of $580 million on a pretax income of $706 million. our tax provision was primarily driven by incremental tax costs associated with the integration of acquired operations and assets and profitable jurisdictions outside of the united states.
in fiscal 2019, we recognized a tax benefit of $127 million on a pretax income of $983 million. the tax benefit recognized was primarily due to the release of our valuation allowance related to federal and state deferred tax assets which was partially offset with the increase in unrecognized tax benefits. in addition, we recognized tax expense for profitable jurisdictions outside of the united states.

liquidity and capital resources at january 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $7.9 billion and accounts receivable of $6.2 billion. our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations, u.s. treasury securities, u.s. agency obligations, asset backed securities, foreign government obligations, mortgage backed obligations, covered bonds, time deposits, money market mutual funds and municipal securities.
as of january 31, 2020, our remaining performance obligation was $30.8 billion. our remaining performance obligation represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized and includes unearned revenue, which has been invoiced and is recorded on the balance sheet, and unbilled amounts that are not recorded on the balance sheet, that will be recognized as revenue in future periods.
table of contents we believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided by operating activities and, if necessary, our borrowing capacity under our revolving loan credit agreement that provides for $1.0 billion unsecured financing ("credit facility") and unbilled amounts related to contracted non-cancelable subscription agreements, which is not reflected on the balance sheet, will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months.
in the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. to facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, impacting our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments.
the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, topic 842, has not impacted the cost of or limited our borrowing capacity from third party lenders.

contractual obligations our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space, co-location data center facilities and our development and test data center, as well as leases for computer equipment, software, furniture and fixtures, excluding all secured and unsecured debt. at january 31, 2020, the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows (in millions):
payments due by period total                 less than 1 year                  1-3 years                  3-5 years                more than 5 years operating lease obligations:
purchase orders are not included in the table above. our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.
during fiscal 2020 and in future fiscal years, we have made and expect to continue to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations, increase productivity and enhance our security measures. we plan to upgrade or replace various internal systems to scale with our overall growth. additionally, we expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars and remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues in future periods as a result of such investments and continued office build-outs, other leasehold improvements and data center investments.
other future obligations in february 2020, the company acquired all outstanding stock of a cloud-based real-time personalization and customer data platform, for approximately $100 million of cash consideration.
table of contents in february 2020, the company made a strategic investment of $150 million in cash for preferred shares of a technology company in a private placement.

in february 2020, the company entered into an agreement to acquire vlocity, inc., a leading provider of industry-specific cloud and mobile software for approximately $1.33 billion of cash consideration. the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, subject to customary closing conditions.
in october 2019, we acquired clicksoftware for approximately $1.4 billion. in the event that we fully integrate the operations and assets of clicksoftware, as well as other acquired israeli based entities into our operations, we may be subject to a potential one-time income tax charge based on an assumed israeli statutory tax rate of 23 percent applied to the value of any transferred intangibles. our tax provision for fiscal 2020 reflects the estimated incremental tax costs associated with the integration of clicksoftware's operations and assets. the timing and amount of the cash payment, if any, is uncertain and would be based upon a number of factors, including our integration plans, valuations related to intercompany transactions, the tax rate in effect at the time, potential negotiations with the taxing authorities and potential litigation.
environmental, social, governance we believe the business of business is to make the world a better place for all of our stakeholders, including our stockholders, customers, employees, partners, the planet and the communities in which we work and live. delivering innovative solutions to our customers is core to our mission and, as a technology company, we have developed solutions on the salesforce platform that enable our customers and stakeholders to manage and affect environmental, social and governance ("esg") matters that are meaningful to them. we also believe that transparently disclosing the goals and relevant metrics related to our esg programs will allow our stakeholders to be informed on our progress. to this end, we are working to align with the recommendations of the financial stability board's ("fsb") task force on climate-related financial disclosures ("tcfd") and of the sustainability accounting standards board ("sasb") by the end of fiscal 2021.
in fiscal 2020, we completed an esg materiality assessment, which identified key topics that are most important to our stakeholders and our success as a business. we expect to update this assessment on a periodic basis to ensure it reflects changes in our business and the external environment. the topics covered in this section include some of the key highlights from that assessment. we also publish an annual stakeholder impact report on our website detailing our overall strategy relating to esg programs as well as our efforts in these areas.
environmental protecting our planet: we are committed to creating a sustainable, low-carbon future. salesforce delivers all customers a carbon neutral cloud and we are committed to achieving 100 percent renewable energy for our global operations by the end of fiscal 2022. in fiscal 2020, we procured electricity from renewable energy resources equivalent to 63 percent of what we used globally. we have set an internal price on carbon by offsetting all of our scope 1 and 2 emissions, as well as the parts of our scope 3 (indirect emissions) related to delivering a carbon neutral cloud and all employee commuting and business travel emissions. in addition, we had our 1.5 degree science-based target approved by the science-based targets initiative. this included a supply chain engagement commitment whereby suppliers representing 60 percent of salesforce's scope 3 emissions, covering all upstream emission categories, will set science-based targets by 2024.
salesforce sustainability cloud: we believe that our technology can play an important role in helping to drive climate action that will accelerate the world's efforts towards carbon neutrality and, in fiscal 2020, we launched salesforce sustainability cloud, a carbon accounting product for businesses and governments to track and manage their greenhouse gas emissions.
social recruiting and managing a global, diverse and skilled workforce: our culture is driven by our core values of trust, customer success, innovation and equality. we believe our company culture fosters open dialogue, collaboration, recognition and a sense of family, all of which allow us to attract and retain the best talent. we invest in programs designed to enhance employee success and create a safe, healthy and engaging working environment. some examples include:
•we review the salaries and bonuses of our global workforce on an annual basis to ensure everyone is paid equally for equal work and close any unexplained gaps. to date, we have spent $10.3 million intended to ensure equal pay for equal work. we also review differences in pay for not only gender, but also race and ethnicity in the united states;
•we aspire to have 50 percent of our u.s. workforce made up of underrepresented groups (women, black, latinx, indigenous, multiracial, lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, trans, queer, people with disabilities, and veterans) by 2023. as of october 31, 2019, 43.9 percent of our u.s. workforce was made up of underrepresented groups;
•we support 12 employee-led and founded employee resource groups, which provide a community for underrepresented groups and their allies, offer professional development and mentoring opportunities, and empower employees to be responsive equality leaders in their community. in fiscal 2020, nearly half of our employees engaged in one or more such resource groups.
workforce development: salesforce is committed to enabling the workforce to learn the skills needed to thrive in the jobs of today and tomorrow. our free online learning platform, trailhead, allows anyone to learn in-demand technology and business skills. to date, over 20 million badges have been earned on trailhead.
ethical and humane use of technology: we aspire to create technology that not only drives the success of our customers, but also upholds the basic human rights of every individual. core to this effort is the establishment of the office of ethical and humane use of technology, working across product, law, policy, and ethics to develop and implement a strategic framework for the ethical and humane use of technology across salesforce.
integrated philanthropy: we believe that business is the greatest platform for change. together with the salesforce foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, to date we have given approximately $330 million to charitable organizations, logged more than 4.9 million employee volunteer hours around the world and provided more than 46,000 nonprofit and higher education organizations with the use of our service offerings for free or at a discount.
philanthropy cloud: philanthropy cloud is an end-to-end solution for our customers employees' philanthropy needs, including donations, volunteering, grants management, and pledge processing.
data security: customers entrust us with their most sensitive data, and they expect us to protect it using security risk management practices and advanced systems that respond to the changing security landscape and emerging threats. we have made and will continue to make substantial investments in our cybersecurity programs. we provide an overview of our program, training, best practices for our customers, and information on system status, security issues, and compliance certificates on our website at www.trust.salesforce.com. in addition, we believe that improvements in data security are critical to realizing the potential of technology and greater connectivity to improve lives around the world and that effective cybersecurity requires an ecosystem-wide approach. this is why we work with partners and stakeholders across the globe to support legislation and initiatives such as the cybersecurity tech accord that would help modernize how we approach cybersecurity as an industry.
data privacy: our customers trust us to help them build meaningful relationships with their own customers. the privacy of the data that we are entrusted to protect is a top priority. our customer agreements (templates of which are publicly available on our website) and our privacy policies (also publicly available on our website) describe how we safeguard data with an effective privacy and security program. we also offer resources to help our customers operate globally in compliance with privacy laws such as gdpr and ccpa.
corporate governance: we are committed to a corporate governance structure that promotes long-term stockholder value creation by providing a leadership structure and composition of the board of directors that is aligned with our strategic direction and providing our stockholders with both the opportunity to provide direct feedback and key substantive rights to ensure accountability. governance is foundational to our esg programs and we work actively with our board of directors on our initiatives. for example, our audit and finance committee oversees cybersecurity matters and meets regularly with our chief trust officer, and our nominating and corporate governance committee oversees our esg programs as set forth in its charter. the privacy and ethical use committee, comprised of independent directors, also oversees our privacy matters and meets regularly with our office of ethical and humane use of technology.

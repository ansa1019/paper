2022 developments the following are the more significant developments in our businesses during 2022:
•revenue increased 3.1% to $66.3 billion, reflecting increases in broadband, business services, wireless and advertising revenue, partially offset by declines in video, voice and other revenue.
•adjusted ebitda increased 4.6% to $29.4 billion primarily due to increases in revenue and decreases in programming expenses, partially offset by increases in other expenses and in technical and product support expenses.
•operating margin increased from 43.7% to 44.3%.
•total customer relationships increased by 75,000, total wireless lines increased by 1.3 million, total broadband customers increased by 250,000, and total video customers decreased by 2.0 million.

•corporate and other adjusted ebitda losses of $1.4 billion remained consistent with the prior year primarily due to increased losses from sky glass and xumo, offset by lower administrative costs.
•our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorization of $20 billion, effective september 13, 2022. repurchased a total of 332 million shares of our class a common stock for $13.0 billion in 2022 compared to a total of 73.2 million shares of our class a common stock for $4.0 billion in 2021. raised our dividend by $0.08 to $1.08 per share on an annualized basis in january 2022 and paid $4.7 billion of dividends in 2022.
comcast 2022 annual report on form 10-k covid-19 has impacted our businesses in a number of ways, affecting the comparability of periods included in this report. the most significant continuing impacts have resulted from temporary restrictions and closures at our international theme parks. the continuing effects of covid-19, in addition to worsening u.s., european and global economic conditions and consumer sentiment, may adversely impact demand for our products and services, including advertising, and our results of operations over the near to medium term. in addition, changes in foreign currency exchange rates have impacted our results of operations in our sky and theme parks segments as a result of the strengthening of the u.s. dollar in 2022 compared to the prior year.

comcast 2022 annual report on form 10-k consolidated revenue the following graph illustrates the contributions to the change in consolidated revenue made by our cable communications, nbcuniversal and sky segments, as well as by corporate and other activities, including eliminations.
the primary drivers of the change in revenue from 2021 to 2022 were as follows:
•growth in our nbcuniversal segments driven by increased revenue in the theme parks, studios and media segments.
•growth in our cable communications segment driven by increased broadband, business services, wireless and advertising, partially offset by decreased video, voice and other revenue.
•growth in corporate and other revenue driven by sales of sky glass televisions, spectacor revenue and xumo revenue related to the xumo play streaming service.
•a decrease in our sky segment driven by decreased direct-to-consumer, content and advertising revenue, as well as the impact of foreign currency translation.
revenue for our segments and other businesses is discussed separately below under the heading "segment operating results."
consolidated costs and expenses the following graph illustrates the contributions to the change in consolidated costs and expenses, excluding depreciation expense, amortization expense, and goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, made by our cable communications, nbcuniversal and sky segments, as well as by corporate and other activities, including adjustments and eliminations.
comcast 2022 annual report on form 10-k the primary drivers of the change in consolidated costs and expenses, excluding depreciation expense, amortization expense, and goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, from 2021 to 2022 were as follows:
•an increase in cable communications segment expenses due to increased other expenses and technical and product support costs, partially offset by decreases in programming expense; franchise and other regulatory fees; advertising, marketing and promotion expenses; and customer service expenses.
•a decrease in sky segment expenses primarily due to a decrease in programming and production costs, partially offset by increases in direct network costs and other expenses, as well as the impacts of foreign currency translation.
costs and expenses for our segments and our corporate operations, business development initiatives and other businesses are discussed separately below under the heading "segment operating results."
consolidated depreciation and amortization expense year ended december 31 (in millions)                   2022             2021             2020             % change             % change percentage changes that are considered not meaningful are denoted with nm.
corporate and other depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to business development initiatives. nbcuniversal depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to the opening of universal beijing resort in september 2021. sky depreciation and amortization expense decreased primarily due to the impacts of foreign currency, partially offset by increased amortization of software. cable communications depreciation and amortization expense remained consistent with the prior year.
amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets totaled $2.2 billion, $2.4 billion and $2.3 billion for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. amounts primarily relate to customer relationship intangible assets recorded in connection with the sky transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the nbcuniversal transaction in 2011.
consolidated goodwill and long-lived asset impairments goodwill and long-lived asset impairments included charges related to our sky segment totaling $8.6 billion for 2022 recognized in connection with our annual impairment assessment. the impairments primarily reflected an increased discount rate and reduced estimated future cash flows as a result of macroeconomic conditions in sky's territories. see "critical accounting judgments and estimates" and note 10 for further discussion.
consolidated interest expense interest expense decreased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to a decrease in average debt outstanding and $204 million of charges recorded in 2021 related to the early redemption of senior notes, partially offset by higher weighted-average interest rates.

comcast 2022 annual report on form 10-k the change in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to our investment in atairos. the income (losses) at atairos were driven by fair value adjustments on its underlying investments with income (loss) of $(434) million and $1.8 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. the change in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to gains on nonmarketable securities in the prior year, while losses on marketable securities were consistent in both years. the change in other income (loss), net in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily resulted from losses on insurance contracts and equity method investment impairments.
consolidated income tax (expense) benefit our effective income tax rate in 2022 and 2021 was 47.0% and 27.5%, respectively.
income tax expense for 2022 was affected by changes in our net deferred tax liabilities as a result of the enactment of tax law changes, including $286 million of benefit in 2022 related to state taxes and $498 million of expense in 2021 in the united kingdom. our effective income tax rate for 2022 was also impacted by the goodwill impairment, which was primarily not deductible for tax purposes. see note 5 for additional information on our effective income tax rate.
consolidated net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests the changes in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to the operations of our xumo streaming platform joint venture in the current year and increased losses at universal beijing resort due to operations in the current year compared to pre-opening costs in the prior year in advance of the park's opening in september 2021 (see note 8).
comcast 2022 annual report on form 10-k segment operating results our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information. we use adjusted ebitda as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments.
see note 2 for our definition of adjusted ebitda and a reconciliation from the aggregate amount of adjusted ebitda for our reportable business segments to consolidated income before income taxes.

customer metrics are presented based on actual amounts. customer relationships represent the number of residential and business customers that subscribe to at least one of our services. one product, two product, and three or more product customers represent residential customers that subscribe to one, two, or three or more of our services, respectively. for multiple dwelling units ("mdus"), including buildings located on college campuses, whose residents have the ability to receive additional services, such as additional programming choices or our hd video or dvr services, we count and report customers based on the number of potential billable relationships within each mdu. for mdus whose residents are not able to receive additional services, the mdu is counted as a single customer. residential broadband and video customer metrics include certain customers that have prepaid for services. business customers are generally counted based on the number of locations receiving services within our distribution system, with certain offerings such as ethernet network services counted as individual customer relationships. wireless lines represent the number of activated, eligible wireless devices on customers' accounts. individual customer relationships may have multiple wireless lines. customer metrics in 2020 and 2021 did not include customers in certain pandemic-related programs through which portions of our customers temporarily received our services for free. these programs ended in december 2021, resulting in a one-time benefit to net additions in 2022.

average monthly total revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business services customers, as well as changes in advertising revenue. while revenue from our residential broadband, video, voice and wireless services is also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle, the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship. each of our services has a different contribution to operating margin. we use average monthly adjusted ebitda per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings. we believe both metrics are useful to understand the trends in our business, and average monthly adjusted ebitda per customer relationship is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses.
comcast 2022 annual report on form 10-k cable communications segment - revenue we are a leading provider of broadband, video, voice, wireless, and other services to residential customers in the united states under the xfinity brand; we also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising. we market our services to residential and business customers individually and as bundled services at a discounted rate.
residential revenue includes amounts earned for providing our broadband, video, voice and wireless services, including equipment and installation services. residential broadband revenue also includes revenue earned related to our customers' use of flex and streaming services, and wireless revenue also includes device sales. revenue from each of our residential services is impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle. franchise and regulatory fees billed to our customers are included with the relevant service, which primarily relate to video and voice services.
broadband revenue increased in 2022 primarily due to an increase in average rates and an increase in the number of residential broadband customers.
video revenue decreased in 2022 primarily due to a decline in the number of residential video customers, partially offset by an increase in average rates. we expect that the number of residential video customers will continue to decline, negatively impacting video revenue as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns.
voice revenue decreased in 2022 primarily due to a decline in the number of residential voice customers. we expect that the number of residential voice customers and voice revenue will continue to decline.
wireless revenue increased in 2022 primarily due to an increase in the number of customer lines and device sales.
business services revenue from our business customers includes our service offerings for small business locations, which primarily include broadband, voice and video services, as well as our solutions for medium-sized customers and larger enterprises, and cellular backhaul services to mobile network operators.
business services revenue increased in 2022 primarily due to increases in average rates and customer relationships compared to the prior year and due to the acquisition of masergy in october 2021.
advertising revenue consists of the sale of advertising on linear television and digital platforms to local, regional and national advertisers, including where we represent the advertising sales efforts of other multichannel video providers, and revenue from our advanced advertising business.
advertising revenue increased in 2022 primarily due to increases in political advertising and revenue from our advanced advertising business. these increases were partially offset by lower local and national advertising revenue, and by advertising revenue at our xumo play streaming service, which is a part of our xumo streaming platform that has been reported in corporate and other since june 2022.
other revenue primarily relates to our security and automation services and also includes revenue related to residential customer late fees and related to other services, such as the licensing of our technology platforms to other multichannel video providers.
cable communications segment - costs and expenses programming expenses, which represent our most significant operating expense, are the fees we incur to provide content to our customers. these expenses represent the programming license fees charged by content providers, including the fees related to the distribution of cable and broadcast network programming and fees charged for retransmission of the signals from local broadcast television stations.
programming expenses decreased in 2022 primarily due to a decline in the number of video subscribers, partially offset by contractual rate increases.
we expect that our programming expenses will be impacted by rate increases to a greater extent in 2023 compared to 2022 due to the timing of contract renewals, which will be offset by expected declines in the number of residential video customers.
technical and product support expenses include costs to complete service call and installation activities; costs for network operations, product development, fulfillment and provisioning; the cost of wireless handsets, tablets and smart watches sold to customers; and monthly wholesale wireless access fees.

non-gaap financial measures consolidated adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is a non-gaap financial measure and is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our businesses. this measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. it is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures, and by our investment activities, including the results of entities that we do not consolidate, as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance. our management and board of directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. it is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. additionally, we believe that adjusted ebitda is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
we define adjusted ebitda as net income attributable to comcast corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. from time to time, we may exclude from adjusted ebitda the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance.
we reconcile consolidated adjusted ebitda to net income attributable to comcast corporation. this measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to comcast corporation, or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with gaap.

constant currency constant currency and constant currency growth rates are non-gaap financial measures that present our results of operations excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. certain of our businesses, including sky, have operations outside the united states that are conducted in local currencies. as a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in u.s. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. in our sky segment, we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the business, and we believe it is helpful for investors to present operating results on a comparable basis year over year to evaluate its underlying performance.
constant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the prior year results adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from the current year rather than the actual exchange rates that were in effect during the respective prior year.

our businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities. we believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing credit facility; and our ability to obtain future external financing. refer to the "contractual obligations" discussion below for additional information regarding our cash requirements. we anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operating activities in repaying our debt obligations, funding our capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets, investing in business opportunities, and returning capital to shareholders.
we maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facility and our commercial paper program to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. our commercial paper program generally provides a lower-cost source of borrowing to fund our short-term working capital requirements. as of december 31, 2022, amounts available under our revolving credit facility, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $10.4 billion. we entered into a new revolving credit facility in march 2021 (see note 6).
we are subject to customary covenants and restrictions set forth in agreements related to debt issued at comcast and certain of our subsidiaries, including the indentures governing our public debt securities and the credit agreement governing the comcast revolving credit facility. our credit facility contains a financial covenant pertaining to leverage, which is the ratio of debt to ebitda, as defined in the credit facility. compliance with this financial covenant is tested on a quarterly basis under the terms of the credit facility. as of december 31, 2022, we met this financial covenant by a significant margin, and we expect to remain in compliance with this financial covenant and other covenants related to our debt. the covenants and restrictions in our revolving credit facility do not apply to certain entities, including sky and our international theme parks.

the variance in changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily related to the timing of amortization and related payments for our film and television costs, including the return to normal production levels and the timing of sporting events, as well as decreases in deferred revenue, partially offset by accruals related to severance in 2022.
the decrease in payments of interest in 2022 was primarily due to the debt exchange in august 2021, including the impact of timing of interest payments, reduced debt balances following repayments in the prior year and cash proceeds from the early settlement of interest rate swaps related to the collateralized obligation.
the increase in income tax payments in 2022 was primarily due to the tax benefit from our senior notes exchange in 2021, which reduced tax payments by $1.3 billion in the prior year, higher taxable income and higher payments relating to the preceding tax year.
investing activities our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures, which are discussed further below. the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments throughout the current year, increased capital expenditures and increased cash paid for intangible assets related to software development. these increases were partially offset by the acquisition of masergy in 2021, increased proceeds from the sale of investments, including maturities of short-term investments in the current year, and decreased cash paid related to the construction of universal beijing resort in the current year.
capital expenditures capital expenditures increased in 2022 primarily due to increased spending in our theme parks segment primarily related to epic universe and increases in our cable communications segment, partially offset by decreases in spending in our sky segment. the costs associated with the construction of universal beijing resort are presented separately in our consolidated statement of cash flows. see note 8.
our most significant capital expenditures are in our cable communications segment, and we expect that this will continue in the future. cable communications' capital expenditures increased primarily due to increased spending on line extensions, scalable infrastructure, support capital and customer premise equipment. the table below summarizes the capital expenditures we incurred in our cable communications segment in 2022, 2021 and 2020.
customer premise equipment                      $2,293          $2,203          $2,333
support capital                                    600             503             589
we expect our capital expenditures for 2023 will be focused on increased investment in scalable infrastructure as we increase capacity and execute our plans to upgrade our network to deliver multigigabit speeds, in line extensions for the expansion of both business services and residential passings in our cable communications segment, and in the continued deployment of wireless gateways. in addition, we expect to continue investment in existing and new attractions at our universal theme parks, including the development of epic universe. capital expenditures for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors, including competition, changes in technology, regulatory changes, the timing and rate of deployment of new services, the capacity required for existing services, the timing of new attractions at our theme parks and potential acquisitions.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities decreased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher repurchases and repayments of debt in the prior year, the change in other financing activities and proceeds from short-term borrowings, net in the current year. these decreases were partially offset by increases in repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and employee plans and dividends paid in the current year. other financing activities included payments related to the redemption of nbcuniversal enterprise redeemable subsidiary preferred stock in the prior year, the settlement of derivative contracts and initial contributions related to our xumo streaming platform joint venture received in the current year under a multiyear funding plan.
in 2022, we issued $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate senior notes maturing between 2025 and 2032, had net borrowings of $665 million under our commercial paper program, and had borrowings of $252 million under the universal beijing resort term loan. in 2022, we made total debt repayments of $2.3 billion, primarily related to senior notes maturing in 2022.
we have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. any such repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or otherwise. see notes 6 and 8 for additional information on our financing activities.
comcast 2022 annual report on form 10-k share repurchases and dividends in the second quarter of 2021, we restarted our share repurchase program, which had been paused since the beginning of 2019. in september 2022, our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorization of $20 billion, effective september 13, 2022. during 2022, we repurchased a total of 332.0 million shares of our class a common stock for $13.0 billion. as of december 31, 2022, we had $16.0 billion remaining under the new share repurchase program authorization. under the new authorization, which does not have an expiration date, we expect to repurchase additional shares of our class a common stock in the open market or in private transactions, subject to market and other conditions.
our board of directors declared quarterly dividends totaling $4.8 billion in 2022. we paid dividends of $4.7 billion in 2022. in january 2023, our board of directors approved an 7.4% increase in our dividend to $1.16 per share on an annualized basis. we expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our board of directors.
the chart below summarizes our share repurchases under our publicly announced share repurchase program authorization and dividends paid in 2022, 2021 and 2020. in addition, we paid $321 million and $674 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans.
share repurchases under share repurchase program authorization and dividends paid contractual obligations the following table summarizes our most significant contractual obligations as of december 31, 2022:
as of december 31, 2022 (in billions)                total        within the next 12 months        beyond the next 12 months debt obligations(a)                             $101.0                      $1.7                            $99.2
(a) amounts represent the face value of debt and exclude interest payments and a collateralized obligation (see note 8).
our largest contractual obligations relate to our outstanding debt. as of december 31, 2022, our debt has a weighted-average time to maturity of approximately 17 years and, including the effects of our derivative financial instruments, our debt had a weighted-average interest rate based on the stated coupons of 3.59% and 93% of our debt obligations were fixed-rate debt. we typically fund and expect to continue to be able to fund debt maturities and interest payments with cash flows generated in our operations; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; or proceeds from additional external financing. see note 6 and item 7a for additional information on our debt.
comcast 2022 annual report on form 10-k we also have significant contractual obligations associated with our programming and production expenses. nbcuniversal and sky have multiyear agreements for broadcast rights of sporting events, such as for the nfl, the olympics and european football leagues, which represent the substantial majority of our programming and production obligations. cable communications' programming expenses related to the distribution of third-party programmed channels are generally acquired under multiyear distribution agreements, with fees typically based on the number of customers that receive the programming and the extent of distribution. as a result, the amounts included in the table above under fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments for these distribution agreements are not material and we expect the total fees to be paid under these arrangements to be significantly higher than the amounts included above. we have funded and expect to continue to be able to fund our programming and production obligations with the cash generated from our operations. as of december 31, 2022, approximately 36% of cash payments related to our programming and production obligations are due after five years, of which the vast majority related to multiyear sports rights agreements. see note 4 for additional information on programming and production costs.
our other contractual obligations relate primarily to operating leases (see note 15) and other arrangements recorded in our consolidated balance sheet and/or disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, including benefit plan obligations (see note 11), liabilities for uncertain tax positions (see note 5), our remaining unfunded capital commitment to atairos (see note 8) and a contractual obligation related to an interest held by a third party in the revenue of certain theme parks (see note 15).
guarantee structure our debt is primarily issued at comcast, although we also have debt at certain of our subsidiaries as a result of acquisitions and other issuances. a substantial amount of this debt is subject to guarantees by comcast and by certain subsidiaries that we have put in place to simplify our capital structure. we believe this guarantee structure provides liquidity benefits to debt investors and helps to simplify credit analysis with respect to relative value considerations of guaranteed subsidiary debt.

(a)nbcuniversal, comcast cable and comcast holdings (included within other debt subject to one-way guarantees) are each consolidated subsidiaries subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the sec. the guarantee structures and related disclosures in this section, together with exhibit 22, satisfy these reporting obligations.
(b)universal beijing resort debt financing is secured by the assets of universal beijing resort and the equity interests of the investors. see note 8 for additional information.
comcast 2022 annual report on form 10-k cross-guarantees comcast, nbcuniversal and comcast cable (the "guarantors") fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, guarantee each other's debt securities. nbcuniversal and comcast cable also guarantee other borrowings of comcast, including its revolving credit facility. these guarantees rank equally with all other general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the respective guarantors. however, the obligations of the guarantors under the guarantees are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of their respective non-guarantor subsidiaries. the obligations of each guarantor are limited to the maximum amount that would not render such guarantor's obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of u.s. and non-u.s. law. each guarantor's obligations will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed securities have been paid in full. however, a guarantee by nbcuniversal or comcast cable of comcast's debt securities, or by nbcuniversal of comcast cable's debt securities, will terminate upon a disposition of such guarantor entity or all or substantially all of its assets.
the guarantors are each holding companies that principally hold investments in, borrow from and lend to non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies; issue and service third-party debt obligations; repurchase shares and pay dividends; and engage in certain corporate and headquarters activities. the guarantors are generally dependent on non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies to fund these activities.
as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, the combined guarantors have noncurrent notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $128 billion and $126 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $30 billion. this financial information is that of the guarantors presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between the guarantors eliminated. the combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries. the underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries are significantly in excess of the guarantor obligations. excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, the guarantors do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations.
one-way guarantees comcast provides full and unconditional guarantees of certain debt issued by sky, including all of its senior notes, and other consolidated subsidiaries not subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the sec.
comcast also provides a full and unconditional guarantee of $138 million principal amount of subordinated debt issued by comcast holdings. comcast's obligations under this guarantee are subordinated and subject, in right of payment, to the prior payment in full of all of comcast's senior indebtedness, including debt guaranteed by comcast on a senior basis, and are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of its non-guarantor subsidiaries (for purposes of this comcast holdings discussion, comcast cable and nbcuniversal are included within the non-guarantor subsidiary group). comcast's obligations as guarantor will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed debt have been paid in full. however, the guarantee will terminate upon a disposition of comcast holdings or all or substantially all of its assets. comcast holdings is a consolidated subsidiary holding company that directly or indirectly holds 100% and approximately 37% of our equity interests in comcast cable and nbcuniversal, respectively.
as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, comcast and comcast holdings, the combined issuer and guarantor of the guaranteed subordinated debt, have noncurrent senior notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $97 billion and $96 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $28 billion and $29 billion, respectively. this financial information is that of comcast and comcast holdings presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between comcast and comcast holdings eliminated. the combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries of comcast and comcast holdings. the underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of comcast and comcast holdings are significantly in excess of the obligations of comcast and comcast holdings. excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt, and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, comcast and comcast holdings do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations.
critical accounting judgments and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. we base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
comcast 2022 annual report on form 10-k we believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights and the accounting for film and television costs are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors, and the audit committee has reviewed the related disclosures below. see also notes 4 and 10.
valuation and impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights we assess the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including cable franchise rights, annually as of july 1, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. the assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. a quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. in connection with our impairment assessment process, in order to support our qualitative assessments, we typically perform quantitative assessments of our cable franchise rights and reporting units approximately once every four years.
goodwill goodwill results from business combinations and represents the excess amount of the consideration paid over the identifiable assets and liabilities recorded in the acquisition. we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and have concluded that our reporting units are generally the same as our reportable segments. we evaluate the determination of our reporting units periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur. when performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair values of our reporting units primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including market participant estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the business and the selection of discount rates. when performing this analysis, we also consider multiples of earnings from comparable public companies and recent market transactions.
pursuant to our practice of performing quantitative assessments of our reporting units approximately once every four years, our current year impairment testing for goodwill in our cable communications and nbcuniversal segments was based on quantitative assessments. based on these assessments, the estimated fair values of these reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values and no impairment was required. the goodwill in our sky segment resulted from our acquisition of sky in the fourth quarter of 2018 and has been in close proximity to its carrying value. we performed a quantitative assessment for goodwill in our sky reporting unit in the current year and determined that the fair value had declined, resulting in an impairment of $8.1 billion (see note 10). in preparing the quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of the sky reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis. the significant judgments in the discounted cash flow analysis for the sky reporting unit included estimated future cash flows generated by the business, including the estimated impacts of macroeconomic conditions in the sky territories, and the selection of the discount rate, which increased by 125 basis points compared to the analysis in 2021. we evaluated the fair value indicated under the discounted cash flow model considering multiples of earnings from comparable public companies and recent market transactions.
changes in market conditions, laws and regulations, and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments, including expected cash flows, competitive factors and discount rates, could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an additional impairment charge.
cable franchise rights our cable franchise rights assets result from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area. the value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market additional services in a particular service area. the amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions. typically when we acquire a cable system, the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights. often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas. we currently serve more than 6,500 franchise areas in the united states.
we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows. accordingly, we do not amortize our cable franchise rights.
for purposes of impairment testing, we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our three cable communications divisions or units of account. we evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level.
comcast 2022 annual report on form 10-k when performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair values of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including the estimate of future cash flows and the selection of discount rates.
pursuant to our practice of performing quantitative assessments of cable franchise rights approximately once every four years, our current year impairment testing was based on a quantitative assessment. based on this assessment, the estimated fair values of our franchise rights substantially exceeded their carrying values and no impairment was required.
changes in market conditions, laws and regulations and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments, including expected cash flows, competitive factors and discount rates, could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge.
film and television content we capitalize costs for owned film and television content, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest, as well as acquired libraries. we have determined that the predominant monetization strategy for the substantial majority of our content is on an individual basis. amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue.
our estimates of ultimate revenue for films generally include revenue from all sources that are expected to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film's initial release. these estimates are based on the distribution strategy and historical performance of similar content, as well as factors unique to the content itself. the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for a film intended for theatrical release is the film's theatrical performance, as subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of a film has historically exhibited a high correlation to its theatrical performance. upon a film's release, our estimates of revenue from succeeding markets, including from content licensing across multiple platforms and home entertainment sales, are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends.
with respect to television series or other owned television programming, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond its initial license window. initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue attributed to the initial license window. once it is determined that a television series or other owned television programming can be licensed beyond the initial license window, revenue estimates for these additional windows or platforms, such as u.s. and international syndication, home entertainment, and other distribution platforms, are included in ultimate revenue. revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or, if still in production, 5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later.
we capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are used, incorporating estimated viewing patterns. we recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative value. estimated relative value is generally based on terms of the contract and the nature of and potential revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract.
capitalized film and television costs are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified. the substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis. licensed content that is not part of a film group is tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network or platform basis, with the exception of our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment. when performing an impairment assessment, we estimate fair value primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including market participant estimates of future cash flows, which are supported by internal forecasts. impairments of capitalized film and television costs were not material in any of the periods presented.

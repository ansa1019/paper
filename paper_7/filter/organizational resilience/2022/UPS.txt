item 7.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we continue to execute our customer first, people led, innovation driven strategy, focusing on the parts of our market that value our integrated global network and building capabilities that matter to our customers. we are shifting our strategic framework to better and bolder by seeking to enhance customer engagement through combining our network with digital capabilities to drive new services, while at the same time increasing efficiencies and remaining disciplined with capital allocation.
a number of macroeconomic factors contributed to a challenging operating environment in 2022, including global inflation and rising interest rates, recessionary forecasts, wage and labor market pressures, geopolitical uncertainties and foreign currency exchange rates relative to the united states ("u.s.") dollar. we continued to be affected by covid-19 lockdowns in china that impacted both manufacturing and supply chains. in addition, consumers returned to more pre-pandemic shopping patterns. these factors resulted in disruptions to certain parts of our business, negatively impacted demand for our services and contributed to increases in certain of our operating costs. we anticipate these factors will continue to impact us into 2023. we expect we may experience additional uncertainty related to the upcoming renegotiation of certain of our union labor agreements.
despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, our strategic execution strengthened our balance sheet and resulted in the generation of strong cash flows for the year. we retired $2.0 billion of debt, reinvested in the business and returned cash to shareowners through dividends and share repurchases. we also completed the acquisition of delivery solutions, a digital platform that optimizes customer deliveries across multiple networks, and the acquisition of bomi group, which will accelerate our growth in healthcare logistics by expanding our footprint and bringing additional expertise in cold chain logistics. neither acquisition had a material impact on our results of operations for the year. see note 8 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for additional information on business acquisitions.
we have two reportable segments: u.s. domestic package and international package, which are together referred to as our global small package operations. our remaining businesses are reported as supply chain solutions.
highlights of our results for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, which are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow, include:
year ended december 31,   change operating expenses (in millions)                        87,244                          84,477        2,767                           3.3   %

united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
•average daily package volume in our global small package operations decreased, primarily due to lower levels of business-to-consumer shipping.
•revenue increased due to strong revenue per piece growth, with most of the increase in our u.s. domestic package segment. revenue in supply chain solutions decreased.
•operating expenses increased, driven by higher fuel prices and higher compensation and benefits expense, primarily in our u.s. domestic package segment.
•operating profit and operating margin increased, with the increases coming from the u.s. domestic package segment and supply chain solutions, while operating profit and operating margin declined in the international package segment.
•we reported net income of $11.5 billion and diluted earnings per share of $13.20. adjusted diluted earnings per share was $12.94 after adjusting for the after-tax impacts of:
◦defined benefit pension and postretirement medical benefit plan mark-to-market gains outside of a 10% corridor, together with defined benefit pension plan curtailment gains, totaling $806 million, or $0.92 per diluted share;
◦a one-time, non-cash charge related to the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards in connection with an incentive compensation program design change of $384 million, or $0.44 per diluted share;
◦a one-time, non-cash charge in connection with a reduction in the estimated residual value of our md-11 aircraft of $58 million, or $0.07 per diluted share; and
◦transformation strategy costs of $142 million, or $0.15 per diluted share.
in the u.s. domestic package segment, revenue growth resulted from higher fuel revenue, driven by increases in both price per gallon and in fuel surcharge rates as part of our pricing initiatives, as well as improvements in revenue quality and customer mix. expenses increased due to higher fuel prices and higher compensation and benefits costs, which were partially offset by declines in purchased transportation costs and higher productivity as we executed our strategy.
in our international package segment, revenue increased slightly, driven by fuel revenue, revenue quality actions and favorable shifts in customer and product mix. these increases were mostly offset by lower volume, the impact of the strengthening u.s. dollar and reductions in demand-related surcharges, primarily in the fourth quarter. expense increases were primarily driven by higher fuel prices, partially offset by favorable currency impacts and volume declines.
in supply chain solutions, the decrease in revenue was driven by volume and market rate declines in forwarding, as well as the impact of divesting ups freight in 2021. these decreases were partially offset by growth in our healthcare operations and in a number of our other businesses. expenses decreased, driven by lower transportation costs in forwarding and a reduction in operating expenses due to the divestiture of ups freight. these decreases were partially offset by higher operating costs in logistics.

these items have been excluded from the following discussions of "adjusted" compensation and benefits, operating expenses, operating profit, operating margin, other income and (expense), income tax expense and effective tax rate. the income tax impacts of these items are calculated by multiplying the statutory tax rates applicable in each tax jurisdiction, including the u.s. federal jurisdiction and various u.s. state and non-u.s. jurisdictions, by the tax-deductible adjustments. the blended average effective income tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 were 26.5% and 23.8%, respectively.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations incentive compensation program design changes during 2022, we completed certain structural changes to the design of our incentive compensation programs that resulted in a one-time, non-cash charge in connection with the accelerated vesting of certain equity incentive awards that we do not expect to repeat. we supplement the presentation of our operating profit, operating margin, income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with non-gaap measures that exclude the impact of these changes. we believe excluding the impacts of such changes allows users of our financial statements to more appropriately identify underlying growth trends in compensation and benefits expense. for information regarding incentive compensation program design changes, see note 13 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.
long-lived asset estimated residual value changes during the fourth quarter of 2022, we determined to retire six of our existing md-11 aircraft from operational use in 2023. in connection therewith, we reduced the estimated residual value of our md-11 fleet, incurring a one-time, non-cash charge on our fully-depreciated aircraft. this charge was allocated between our domestic package and international package segments. we supplement the presentation of our operating profit, operating margin, income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with non-gaap measures that exclude the impact of this charge. we believe excluding the impact of this charge better enables users of our financial statements to understand the ongoing cost associated with our long-lived assets. for information regarding residual values, see note 4 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.
transformation charges, and goodwill, asset impairment and divestiture charges we supplement the presentation of our operating profit, operating margin, income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with non-gaap measures that exclude the impact of charges related to transformation activities, and goodwill, asset impairment and divestiture charges. we believe excluding the impact of these charges better enables users of our financial statements to view underlying business performance from the perspective of management. we do not consider these costs when evaluating the operating performance of our business units, making decisions to allocate resources or in determining incentive compensation awards. for more information regarding transformation activities, see note 18 to the audited, consolidated financial statements. for more information regarding goodwill and asset impairment charges, and divestitures, see note 1 and note 7 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.
foreign currency exchange rate changes and hedging activities we supplement the reporting of revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit with adjusted measures that exclude the period over period impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and hedging activities. we believe currency-neutral revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit information allows users of our financial statements to understand growth trends in our products and results. we evaluate the performance of international package and supply chain solutions on this currency-neutral basis.
currency-neutral revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit are calculated by dividing current period reported u.s. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit by the current period average exchange rates to derive current period local currency revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit. the derived amounts are then multiplied by the average foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the comparable results for each month in the prior year period (including the period over period impact of foreign currency hedging activities). the difference between the current period reported u.s. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit and the derived current period u.s. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit is the period over period impact of currency fluctuations.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plan gains and losses we incur certain employment-related expenses associated with pension and postretirement medical benefits. these pension and postretirement medical benefits costs for company-sponsored defined benefit plans are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies, including discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, healthcare cost trend rates, inflation, compensation increase rates, mortality rates and coordination of benefits with plans not sponsored by ups. actuarial assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis, unless circumstances require an interim remeasurement of any of our plans.
we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10% corridor (defined as 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation), as well as gains and losses resulting from plan curtailments and settlements, for our defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plans immediately as part of investment income (expense) and other in the statements of consolidated income. we supplement the presentation of our income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with adjusted measures that exclude the impact of these gains and losses and the related income tax effects. we believe excluding these defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plan gains and losses provides important supplemental information by removing the volatility associated with plan amendments and short-term changes in market interest rates, equity values and similar factors.
the remeasurement of our defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plans' assets and liabilities resulted in gains of $1.1 and $3.3 billion for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the table below shows the amounts associated with each component of these gains, as well as the weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine our net periodic benefit cost, for each year:

the pre-tax defined benefit plan gains and losses for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 consisted of the following:
2022 - $1.1 billion pre-tax defined benefit plan gain:
•discount rates ($5.2 billion pre-tax gain): the weighted-average discount rate for our pension and postretirement medical plans increased from 3.11% as of december 31, 2021 to 5.77% as of december 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase in u.s. treasury yields as well as an increase in credit spreads on aa-rated corporate bonds in 2022.
•return on assets ($4.1 billion pre-tax loss): in 2022, the actual rate of return on plan assets was lower than our expected rate of return, primarily due to weaker global equity and u.s. bond market performance.
•demographic and other assumption changes ($0.1 billion pre-tax loss): this loss was due to the differences between actual and estimated participant data and demographic factors, including healthcare cost trends, compensation rate increases and rates of termination, retirement and mortality.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
2021 - $3.3 billion pre-tax defined benefit plan gain, primarily due to the impact of the interim remeasurement of the ups/ibt plan in the first quarter of 2021 as described in note 5 to the audited, consolidated financial statements:
•discount rates ($1.9 billion pre-tax gain): this gain was largely attributable to an increase in the discount rate for the ups/ibt plan from 2.98% as of december 31, 2020 to 3.70% as of march 31, 2021, driven by an increase in u.s. treasury yields in 2021.
•return on assets ($0.3 billion pre-tax loss): this loss was driven by the actual rate of return on plan assets being approximately 220 basis points lower than our expected rate of return as of march 31, 2021, primarily due to weak global equity and u.s. bond market performance.
•demographic and other assumption changes ($0.1 billion pre-tax loss): this loss was due to the differences between actual and estimated participant data and demographic factors, including healthcare cost trends, compensation rate increases and rates of termination, retirement and mortality.
•coordinating benefits attributable to the central states pension fund ($1.8 billion pre-tax gain): this represents a reduction of the liability for potential coordinating benefits that may be required to be paid related to the central states pension fund.
expense allocations certain operating expenses are allocated between our operating segments using activity-based costing methods. these activity-based costing methods require us to make estimates that impact the amount of each expense category that is attributed to each segment. changes in these estimates directly impact the amount of expense allocated to each segment and therefore the operating profit of each reporting segment. our allocation methodologies are refined periodically, as necessary, to reflect changes in our businesses. there were no significant changes to our allocation methodologies for 2022 relative to 2021.

revenue the change in revenue was due to the following factors:
revenue change drivers:       volume                  rates /                    fuel                       total revenue product mix                surcharge                  change revenue also benefited from one additional operating day in 2022 compared to 2021.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations volume average daily volume decreased, driven by a 5.1% reduction in residential shipments. the decline in residential shipments was driven by declines from our largest customer in accordance with our agreed upon contract terms as we continued to execute within our strategy. this decline was slightly offset by growth from small- and medium-sized businesses ("smbs"), including the expansion of our digital access program. macroeconomic factors, including rising interest rates and inflation, and the shift in consumer spending back towards services and in-store shopping also contributed to the residential volume decline. business-to-consumer shipments represented approximately 59.4% of average daily volume compared to 60.7% in 2021.
business-to-business shipments remained relatively flat compared to 2021. commercial activity increased in the first half of the year, but declined in the second half of 2022, primarily from industry sectors that are more sensitive to the macroeconomic factors discussed above.
we anticipate overall average daily volume year-over-year growth rates will continue to decline in the first half of 2023 and then grow through the remainder of the year as economic conditions improve.
within our air products, average daily volume decreases were driven by lower volumes from certain large customers, as well as shifts in product preferences during the second half of the year.
ground residential average daily volume decreased 4.3%, driven by the declines discussed above. surepost volume remained relatively flat for the year. ground commercial volume increased 0.6%, driven by growth from smbs and large customers in the first half of 2022 that was largely offset by volume declines in the second half of the year.
rates and product mix revenue per piece in our air and ground products increased for the full year, driven by base rate increases and other pricing actions, and favorable changes in customer mix. a shift in product mix during the second half of the year, and declines in demand-related surcharges, slightly offset these increases. rates for air and ground products increased an average of 5.9% in december 2021. in our next day air and deferred products, revenue per piece growth was negatively impacted by a reduction in average billable weight per piece.
we anticipate moderate revenue per piece growth in 2023 as we continue to execute on pricing initiatives within our strategy.
fuel surcharges we apply a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services that adjusts weekly. our air fuel surcharge is based on the u.s. department of energy's ("doe") gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type fuel, and our ground fuel surcharge is based on the doe's on-highway diesel fuel price.
fuel surcharge revenue increased $3.0 billion, driven by increases in price per gallon and increases in fuel surcharges as part of our pricing initiatives. we expect a reduction in fuel surcharge revenue in 2023 based on the current commodity market outlook.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operating expenses operating expenses and adjusted operating expenses increased year over year. the increase includes the impact of one additional operating day. the cost of operating our integrated air and ground network increased $858 million and pickup and delivery costs increased $1.5 billion. other indirect operating costs increased $498 million and package sorting costs increased $163 million. these increases primarily consisted of the following:
•higher fuel costs, primarily attributable to increases in the price of jet fuel, diesel and gasoline. as noted above, we expect fuel prices to decline in 2023.
•increases in employee benefits expense for our union workforce, driven by contractual rate increases for contributions to multiemployer benefit plans, as well as higher year-over-year service cost for our company-sponsored pension plans.
•higher compensation expense due to contractual rate increases and cost of living and market-rate adjustments for our union workforce, that were partially offset by a decrease in union labor hours.
•inflationary pressures that contributed to cost increases in repairs and maintenance and facility operating costs.
these increases were partially offset by lower purchased transportation costs due to a reduction in ground volume handled by third-party carriers and continued productivity initiatives as we executed within our strategy.
total cost per piece increased 9.2% for the year and adjusted cost per piece increased 8.6%, for the reasons described above. we anticipate that the cost per piece growth rate will be elevated in the first quarter of 2023 and will then moderate throughout the remainder of the year. we expect our productivity initiatives will continue to help offset rising compensation and benefit costs.
operating profit and margin as a result of the factors described above, operating profit increased $561 million, with operating margin increasing 20 basis points to 10.9%. adjusted operating profit increased $857 million, with adjusted operating margin increasing 70 basis points to 11.8%.

export volume decreased for the year driven by reduced intra-europe activity, as well as lower volumes on the asia and u.s. export trade lanes. intra-europe declines resulted from overall economic conditions. the decline in asia export trade lanes was also driven by covid-19 lockdowns, which resulted in fewer flights being operated throughout the year and reduced business activity within china and hong kong. we experienced lower volumes from certain large customers on u.s. export trade lanes, due to the strength of the u.s. dollar and the economic factors discussed above.
our premium products saw volume decline 3.0%, primarily from our express saver product which was impacted by lower volumes from certain large customers as a result of the economic factors and covid-19 disruptions discussed above. volume in our non-premium products decreased 1.4%, driven by declines in our worldwide products. these declines were the result of an overall reduction in consumer demand for all of the reasons discussed above.
domestic volume declines were largest in europe and canada, where macroeconomic conditions and the year-over-year impact of covid-19 restrictions on e-commerce spending resulted in lower residential deliveries.
rates and product mix in december 2021, we implemented an average 5.9% net increase in base and accessorial rates for international shipments originating in the united states. rate changes for shipments originating outside the u.s. are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market. we continue to apply demand-related surcharges on certain lanes.
total revenue per piece increased 7.6%, primarily due to fuel surcharges and favorable shifts in customer and product mix as we executed on revenue quality initiatives. demand-related surcharges contributed slightly to the growth in revenue per piece, although we experienced a decline in these surcharges during the latter part of the year. unfavorable currency movements partially offset these increases. excluding the impact of currency, revenue per piece increased 13.5%.
export revenue per piece increased 5.0% for the reasons described above. excluding the impact of currency, export revenue per piece increased 9.6%.
domestic revenue per piece increased 2.1% for the reasons described above. excluding the impact of currency, domestic revenue per piece increased 13.3%.
fuel surcharges the fuel surcharge we apply to international air services originating inside or outside the u.s. is largely indexed to the doe's gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel. the fuel surcharges for ground services originating outside the u.s. are indexed to fuel prices in the region or country where the shipment originates.
total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by $1.2 billion, driven primarily by increases in price per gallon as well as changes in fuel surcharge rates as part of our pricing strategy. these increases were slightly offset by unfavorable currency movements and volume declines. based on commodity forecasts, we expect declining fuel prices will drive a decrease in fuel surcharge revenue in 2023.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operating expenses operating expenses, and adjusted operating expenses, increased year over year. this includes the impact of one additional operating day. the costs of operating our integrated international air and ground network increased $1.1 billion, primarily due to higher fuel prices. as noted above, we expect fuel prices to decrease in 2023.
pickup and delivery costs decreased $333 million, other indirect costs, including compensation and benefits, decreased $319 million and package sorting costs decreased $20 million as inflationary pressures were more than offset by favorable currency movements and volume declines. we expect volume declines and inflationary pressures will continue to impact our costs in 2023. we will continue adjusting our network in order to mitigate these impacts.
operating profit and margin as a result of the factors described above, operating profit decreased $320 million, with operating margin decreasing 180 basis points to 22.0%. adjusted operating profit decreased $301 million and adjusted operating margin decreased 180 basis points to 22.4%.

united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations revenue total revenue within supply chain solutions decreased for the year. lower volume and revenue in forwarding and the impact of divesting ups freight in the second quarter of 2021 more than offset strong revenue growth in logistics and a number of our other businesses.
forwarding revenue was impacted by the following:
•international airfreight revenue decreased approximately $480 million, as challenging economic conditions and lockdowns in china drove a decline in customer demand during the year. lower demand coupled with higher capacity, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2022, resulted in a decline in the market rates we charge for services, including demand-related surcharges that were elevated in the first quarter of the year.
•revenue in our truckload brokerage business decreased approximately $300 million, as volume and market rates declined. these declines were partly offset by successful revenue quality initiatives.
•the remaining reduction in revenue was attributable to ocean freight forwarding as a result of a significant decline in market rates in the second half of the year, particularly on the asia to u.s. lane. volume also declined during the year, driven by lower customer demand.
as a result of expected market conditions, we anticipate that volume will remain challenged and that market rates within all of our forwarding businesses during the first half of 2023 will be lower than the first half of 2022. rates in our airfreight and truckload brokerage businesses are expected to stabilize in the latter half of 2023.
revenue within our logistics businesses increased as a result of the following factors:
•healthcare logistics revenue increased approximately $360 million, driven by clinical trials and pharmaceuticals. we expect growth to continue in 2023, including revenue from bomi group, which we acquired in the fourth quarter.
•revenue in our mail services business increased approximately $160 million as a result of volume from new customers, rate increases and a favorable shift in product characteristics.
•the remaining revenue growth was within our other distribution operations. we experienced year-over-year revenue increases, driven by customer expansion, revenue quality initiatives and increased demand for warehousing services.
revenue from the other businesses within supply chain solutions increased, partly due to the acquisition of roadie, inc. in the fourth quarter of 2021. revenue from transition services provided to the acquirer of ups freight increased and revenue from our service contracts with the u.s. postal service also increased. we expect our transition services revenue to decline in 2023 as the acquirer of ups freight begins to exit these arrangements.
operating expenses total operating expenses and total adjusted operating expenses for supply chain solutions decreased for the year. this included a decrease of $952 million due to the divestiture of ups freight in 2021.
forwarding operating expenses decreased $1.1 billion, driven by a reduction in purchased transportation costs. elevated market rates in the first half of 2022 were more than offset by declines in the latter part of the year. we expect market volume and rates will remain low through at least mid-2023, which will reduce our purchased transportation costs.
logistics operating expenses increased $485 million, including the impact of the bomi group acquisition. compensation and benefits expense increased, driven by business growth and inflationary pressures across our logistics businesses. purchased transportation costs increased in our healthcare and mail services businesses due to business growth. mail services expenses were also impacted by transportation rate increases and higher fuel surcharges.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations expenses for the other businesses within supply chain solutions increased. this was driven by the acquisition of roadie, inc. in the fourth quarter of 2021, and higher fuel costs associated with service contracts with the u.s. postal service. costs incurred in procuring transportation for, and providing transition services to, the acquirer of ups freight also increased for the year. we expect these costs to decline in 2023 as the acquirer of ups freight continues to exit these arrangements.
operating profit and margin as a result of the factors described above, total operating profit increased $43 million, with operating margin increasing 90 basis points to 10.8%. on an adjusted basis, operating profit increased $153 million and operating margin increased 150 basis points to 11.3%.

united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations compensation and benefits total compensation and benefits and adjusted total compensation and benefits increased. compensation costs increased $495 million. on an adjusted basis, compensation costs decreased $16 million. the principal factors impacting the change were:
•u.s. domestic direct labor costs increased $422 million due to annual contractual rate increases for our union workforce that occur in august, as well as cost of living adjustments driven by inflation and other market factors. headcount in our line-haul network operations also increased. these increases were partially offset by a reduction in labor hours, driven by volume declines and productivity improvements.
•supply chain solutions' compensation costs increased $95 million, driven by business growth and inflationary pressures across our logistics operations.
•management compensation increased $466 million, primarily due to the accelerated vesting of certain equity incentive awards in connection with a one-time change to the design of our incentive compensation programs. on an adjusted basis, management compensation increased $42 million due to salary growth, which was partially offset by reductions in other incentive awards and sales commissions.
we expect inflation and other market factors will continue to impact compensation cost in certain parts of our business in 2023.
benefits costs increased $579 million and increased $745 million on an adjusted basis, primarily as a result of:
•health and welfare costs increased $195 million, driven by increased contributions to multiemployer plans as a result of contractual rate increases that occur annually in august. the ups freight divestiture in 2021 reduced expense by $75 million.
•pension and postretirement benefits increased $215 million due to contractually-mandated contribution increases to multiemployer plans and higher service costs for company-sponsored plans. the ups freight divestiture in 2021 reduced expense by $53 million.
•vacation, excused absence, payroll taxes and other expenses increased $248 million, driven by wage growth and additional discretionary payments. the ups freight divestiture in 2021 reduced expense by $54 million.
•workers' compensation expense increased $88 million due to an increase in current year claims, partially offset by favorable developments in reserves for existing claims.
repairs and maintenance the increase in repairs and maintenance expense was due to an increase in planned building maintenance as well as increases in the cost of materials and supplies, which we expect to persist in 2023. we also incurred higher costs for aircraft engine and airframe maintenance due to the timing of scheduled maintenance events. we anticipate these costs will remain elevated as scheduled maintenance events commence on newer aircraft within our fleet.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased, primarily due to the reduction in the estimated residual value of our fully-depreciated md-11 aircraft, facility automation and expansion projects, investments in internally developed software and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. excluding the impact of the estimated residual value change, adjusted depreciation and amortization expense increased due to the aforementioned factors. the reduction in estimated residual value of our md-11 aircraft will result in additional depreciation expense for the remainder of these aircraft in 2023 and thereafter.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations purchased transportation the decrease in purchased transportation expense charged to us by third-party air, ocean and truck carriers was primarily attributable to:
•supply chain solutions expense decreased $957 million, resulting from volume declines in our international air and ocean freight and truckload brokerage businesses and declining market rates paid for services in the latter half of the year. these impacts were slightly offset by expense increases in our logistics operations due to business growth and third-party rate increases in our mail services business. the ups freight divestiture in 2021 drove a decrease of $260 million.
•u.s. domestic expense decreased $254 million, driven by a reduction in ground volume handled by third-party carriers as a result of network optimization initiatives. this was partially offset by the impacts of higher fuel surcharges and rate increases.
•international expense decreased $194 million, primarily due to a reduction in air charter expense in the second half of the year and favorable currency movements. these decreases were partially offset by increases in markets rates for ground transportation and fuel surcharges from third-party carriers.
fuel the increase in fuel expense was primarily driven by higher prices for jet fuel, diesel and gasoline. market prices, and the manner in which we purchase fuel, influence our costs. the majority of our fuel purchases utilize index-based pricing formulas plus or minus a fixed locational/supplier differential. while many of the indices are correlated, each index may respond differently to changes in underlying prices, which in turn can drive variability in our costs.
other occupancy the increase in other occupancy expense, and adjusted other occupancy expense, was due to additional facilities coming into service, higher utilities costs and rent and property tax increases. we expect inflation may continue to impact rent and utility costs in 2023.
other expenses other expenses and adjusted other expenses increased primarily as a result of:
•an increase of $170 million in commissions paid for certain online shipments.
•hosted software application fees and other technology costs increased $115 million in support of ongoing investments in our digital transformation.
•professional fees increased $72 million, driven by an increase in support services provided to various business units and information technology consulting to support ongoing strategic initiatives.
•other increases included the cost of goods provided under transitional service agreements to the acquirer of ups freight, allowances for credit losses, facility security expenses and self-insured automobile liability expense, driven by increases in the frequency and severity of claims.
these increases were partially offset by favorable developments in certain legal and tax contingencies and reductions in asset impairment charges and customer claims.

investment income (expense) and other investment and other income decreased $2.0 billion, primarily due to a reduction in mark-to-market gains recognized on remeasurements of our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans. excluding the impact of these gains, adjusted investment and other income increased $167 million, driven by higher yields on higher average invested balances and foreign currency gains. these increases were partially offset by declines in the fair values of certain non-current investments.
interest expense interest expense increased due to the impact of higher effective interest rates on floating rate debt, partially offset by lower average outstanding debt balances, higher capitalized interest and favorable foreign currency exchange rate impacts on foreign currency-denominated debt.

united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources we deploy a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation, including returns to shareowners through dividends and share repurchases. as of december 31, 2022, we had $7.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. we believe that these positions, expected cash from operations, access to commercial paper programs and capital markets and other available liquidity options will be adequate to fund our material short- and long-term cash requirements, including our business operations, planned capital expenditures and pension contributions, transformation strategy costs, debt obligations and planned shareowner returns. we regularly evaluate opportunities to optimize our capital structure, including through issuances of debt to refinance existing debt and to fund operations.
cash flows from operating activities the following is a summary of the significant sources (uses) of cash from operating activities (in millions):

net cash from operating activities decreased $903 million in 2022, driven by higher contributions to our company-sponsored defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plans. we made discretionary contributions to our qualified u.s. pension plans of $1.9 billion in 2022 compared to $0.2 billion in 2021.
our working capital benefited from an improvement in collections that was partially offset by increases in duty and tax settlements on behalf of our customers due to the timing of payments. additionally, during 2022, we paid $234 million of employer payroll taxes that were deferred under the coronavirus aid, recovery and economic security ("cares") act in 2020, compared to a payment of $577 million in 2021. we paid the remaining $323 million of deferred employer payroll taxes in january 2023.
cash payments for income taxes were $2.6 billion and $1.9 billion for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, with changes driven by the timing of deductions related to pension contributions and depreciation.
as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our working capital efficiency, certain financial institutions offer a supply chain finance ("scf") program to certain of our suppliers. we agree to commercial terms with our suppliers, including prices, quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the scf program. suppliers issue invoices to us based on the agreed-upon contractual terms. if they participate in the scf program, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine which invoices, if any, to sell to the financial institutions. our suppliers' voluntary inclusion of invoices in the scf program has no bearing on our payment terms. no guarantees are provided by us under the scf program. we have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to participate, and we have no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions, as it relates to the scf program.
amounts due to our suppliers that participate in the scf program are included in accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets. we have been informed by the participating financial institutions that as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, suppliers sold them $806 and $545 million, respectively, of our outstanding payment obligations. amounts due to suppliers that participate in the scf program may be reflected in cash flows from operating activities or cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. the amounts settled through the scf program were approximately $2.3 and $1.7 billion for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of december 31, 2022, approximately $2.2 billion of our total worldwide holdings of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries. the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our u.s. and foreign subsidiaries fluctuates throughout the year due to a variety of factors, including the timing of cash receipts and disbursements in the normal course of business. cash provided by operating activities in the u.s. continues to be our primary source of funds to finance domestic operating needs, capital expenditures, share repurchases, pension contributions and dividend payments to shareowners. all cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries are generally available for distribution to the u.s. without any u.s. federal income taxes. any such distributions may be subject to foreign withholding and u.s. state taxes. when amounts earned by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be indefinitely reinvested, no accrual for taxes is provided.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cash flows from investing activities our primary sources (uses) of cash from investing activities for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in millions):
capital expenditures:

(1) in addition to capital expenditures of $4.8 and $4.2 billion for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, there were principal repayments of finance lease obligations of $149 and $208 million, respectively. these are included in cash flows from financing activities.
we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft, vehicles, equipment and real estate to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth. future capital spending for anticipated growth and replacement assets will depend on a variety of factors, including regulatory, economic and industry conditions. our current investment program anticipates investments in technology initiatives and enhanced network capabilities, including over $1.0 billion of projects to support our environmental sustainability goals. it also provides for maintenance of buildings, facilities and equipment and replacement of certain aircraft within our fleet. we currently expect our capital expenditures will be approximately $5.3 billion in 2023, of which approximately 50 percent will be allocated to expansion projects.
total capital expenditures increased in 2022, primarily due to:
•spending on buildings, facilities and plant equipment increased, largely due to facility automation and capacity expansion projects in our global small package business. expenditures in the fourth quarter more than offset the impact of supply chain disruptions that we experienced earlier in the year.
•aircraft and parts expenditures increased due to higher contract deposits on open aircraft orders, partially offset by fewer payments associated with the delivery of aircraft.
•vehicles expenditures increased as supply chain constraints eased in the latter half of 2022 relative to 2021.
•information technology expenditures increased due to additional deployments of technology equipment and continuing investments in our digital capabilities and network automation.
proceeds from the disposal of businesses, property, plant and equipment decreased, primarily due to the 2021 divestiture of ups freight for cash proceeds of $848 million. net purchases of marketable securities increased due to a shift to longer duration investments. the net change in finance receivables was primarily due to reductions in outstanding balances within our finance portfolios.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the increase in cash paid for acquisitions in 2022 was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of bomi group and delivery solutions, and the purchase of development areas for the ups store. cash paid for acquisitions in 2021 related to the acquisition of roadie and the purchase of development areas for the ups store. the increase in other investing activities was driven by our investment of $252 million in the parent company of commercehub, inc., as well as changes in our other non-current investments and various other items.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cash flows from financing activities our primary sources (uses) of cash for financing activities were as follows (amounts in millions, except per share data):
number of shares repurchased                               (19.0)                     (2.6)
net borrowings (repayments) of debt principal            $(2,304)                  $(2,773)
capitalization:
total capitalization                                      $39,465                   $36,184
we repurchased 19.0 and 2.6 million shares of class b common stock for $3.5 billion and $500 million under our stock repurchase program for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. we anticipate our share repurchases will total $3.0 billion for 2023. for additional information on our share repurchase activities, see note 12 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.
for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, dividends reported within shareowners' equity include $249 and $167 million, respectively, of non-cash dividends that were settled in shares of class a common stock.
the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the board and depends on various factors, including our net income, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other relevant factors. in the first quarter of 2023, we increased our quarterly dividend from $1.52 to $1.62 per share.
there were no issuances of debt in 2022. issuances of debt in 2021 consisted of short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program.
repayments of debt in 2022 included scheduled principal payments on our finance lease obligations, payment of amounts assumed in the bomi group acquisition and repayment at maturity of senior notes as follows:
repayments of debt in 2021 included scheduled principal payments on our finance lease obligations, payments of commercial paper balances and repayment at maturity of senior notes as follows:
as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, we had no outstanding balances under our commercial paper programs.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we have $2.2 billion of fixed- and floating-rate senior notes that mature in 2023. we may repay these amounts when due with cash generated from operations or other borrowings, depending on various factors. we consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and non-scheduled repayments of debt.
other financing activities includes cash used to repurchase shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations on vested employee stock awards. cash outflows for this purpose were $516 and $358 million for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the increase was driven by changes in required repurchase amounts.
except as disclosed in note 9 to the audited, consolidated financial statements, we do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.
sources of credit see note 9 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our available credit and our debt covenants.
contractual commitments we have material cash requirements for known contractual obligations and commitments in the form of finance leases, operating leases, debt obligations, purchase commitments and certain other liabilities that are disclosed in the notes to the audited, consolidated financial statements and discussed below. we expect to fund these obligations and other discretionary payments, including expected returns to shareowners, primarily through cash from operations.
we anticipate making discretionary contributions to our company-sponsored u.s. defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plans of approximately $1.2 billion in 2023, which are included within expected employer contributions to plan trusts shown in note 5 to the audited, consolidated financial statements. there are currently no anticipated required minimum cash contributions to our qualified u.s. pension plans. the amount of any minimum funding requirement, as applicable, for these plans could change significantly in future periods depending on many factors, including plan asset returns, discount rates, other actuarial assumptions, changes to pension plan funding regulations and the discretionary contributions that we make. actual contributions made in future years could materially differ and consequently required minimum contributions beyond 2023 cannot be reasonably estimated. as a result of the amendments to the ups 401(k) savings plan discussed in note 5 to the audited, consolidated financial statements, we expect contributions to this plan will increase by approximately $450 million beginning in 2024.
as discussed in note 6 to the audited, consolidated financial statements, we are not currently subject to any surcharges or minimum contributions outside of our agreed-upon contractual rates with respect to the multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans in which we participate. contribution rates to these multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans are established through the collective bargaining process.
we have outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds that are discussed in note 9 to the audited, consolidated financial statements. additionally, we have $2.2 billion of fixed- and floating-rate senior notes that mature in 2023. we may repay these amounts when due with cash generated from operations or other borrowings, depending on various factors. estimated future interest payments on our outstanding debt total approximately $11.3 billion. this amount was calculated using the contractual interest payments due on our fixed- and variable-rate debt based on interest rates as of december 31, 2022, taking into account the effect of any interest rate swap agreements. for debt denominated in a foreign currency, the u.s. dollar equivalent principal amount of the debt at the end of the year was used as the basis to project future interest payments.
annual principal payments on our long-term debt, and purchase commitments for certain capital expenditures are also set out in note 9 to the audited, consolidated financial statements. included within these purchase commitments are firm commitments to purchase seven new and used boeing 767-300 aircraft to be delivered in 2023, 21 new boeing 767-300 aircraft to be delivered between 2024 and 2026, and two used boeing 747-8f aircraft to be delivered in 2024. additionally, we anticipate purchasing over 2,400 alternative fuel vehicles in 2023.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to purchase commitments, we have other contractual agreements including equipment rentals, software licensing and commodity contracts.
our finance lease obligations, including purchase options that are reasonably certain to be exercised, relate primarily to leases on aircraft and real estate. these obligations, together with our obligations under operating leases are set out in note 11 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.
under provisions of the tax cuts and jobs act, we elected to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries over eight years through 2025. additionally, we have uncertain tax positions that are further discussed in note 15 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.
contingencies see note 5 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for a discussion of pension-related matters, note 10 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for a discussion of judicial proceedings and other matters arising from the conduct of our business activities and note 15 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income-tax-related matters.

united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with gaap. we base our estimates on prior experience, current trends, various other assumptions and third-party input that we consider reasonable to our circumstances. actual results could differ materially from our estimates, which would affect the related amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts, we believe that the following critical accounting estimates involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.
contingencies from time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings and have exposure to various other contingent obligations. the events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable. at the time a contingency is identified, we consider all relevant facts as part of our evaluation. we apply judgment when establishing a range of reasonably possible losses for our contingencies. our judgment is influenced by our understanding of information currently available for legal actions and potential outcomes of these actions, including the advice from our internal counsel, external counsel and senior management.
we record a liability for a loss when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable. for such accruals, we record the amount we consider to be the best estimate within a range of potential losses; however, when there appears to be a range of equally possible losses, our accrual is based on the low end of this range. the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a reasonable estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available. additionally, events may arise that were not anticipated and, as a result, the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss that differs materially from our previously estimated liability. except as disclosed in note 10 to the audited, consolidated financial statements, contingent losses that were probable and estimable were not material to our financial position or results of operations as of, or for the year ended, december 31, 2022. in addition, we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of, or for the year ended, december 31, 2022, because a loss was not reasonably estimable. obligations relating to income taxes and self-insurance are discussed below.
goodwill and intangible asset impairments we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. we did not incur goodwill impairment charges in 2022 or 2021. during 2020, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $494 million in our former ups freight reporting unit.
the determination of reporting units requires judgment, and if we changed the definition of our reporting units, it is possible that we would have reached different conclusions when performing our impairment tests. goodwill impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations.
we initially evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive, we quantitatively assess the fair value of a reporting unit to test goodwill for impairment. this assessment uses a combination of income and market approaches:
•the income approach uses a discounted cash flow ("dcf") model, which requires us to make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows. these assumptions include projections of future revenue, costs, capital expenditures, working capital and the cost of capital. we are also required to make assumptions relating to our overall business and operating strategy, and the regulatory and market environment. changes in any of these assumptions could significantly impact the fair value of any one of our reporting units. the projections that we use in our dcf model are updated annually, or more often if necessary, and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units.
•the market approach uses observable market data of comparable public companies to estimate fair value utilizing financial metrics (such as enterprise value to net sales). we apply judgment to select appropriate comparison companies based on the business operations, size and operating results of our reporting units. changes to our selection of comparable companies or market multiples may result in changes to the estimates of fair value of our reporting units.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of our july 1st testing date, we concluded the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value; however, the excess of fair value over the carrying value for our roadie reporting unit was less than 10 percent. in addition to business performance, our valuation estimate is most sensitive to changes in the cost of capital. if the cost of capital used in our july 1st test increased by 150 basis points, it is reasonably possible that the reporting unit would be impaired. we believe the fair value of the roadie reporting unit continues to exceed its carrying value; however, if the cost of capital increases or the business does not meet forecasts, we may incur an impairment charge in the future. the goodwill associated with our roadie reporting unit as of december 31, 2022 was $241 million.
we evaluate the indefinite-lived trade name associated with our truckload brokerage business for impairment using the relief from royalty method. this valuation approach requires that we make a number of assumptions to estimate fair value, including projections of future revenues, market royalty rates, tax rates, discount rates and other relevant variables. the projections we use in the model are updated annually and will change over time based on historical performance and changing business conditions. if the carrying value of the trade name exceeded its estimated fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess amount.
in addition to business performance, our valuation estimate is most sensitive to changes in royalty rates and the cost of capital. the ratio of excess fair value to carrying value would decrease by approximately one percentage point if the royalty rate decreased by five basis points or the cost of capital increased by ten basis points. a ten percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our trade name would have had no effect on its carrying value as of our july 1st measurement date. however, if near-term economic conditions change our assumptions unfavorably, or result in the reporting unit being unable to meet forecasts, there could be a more significant decrease in the estimated fair value of the trade name, which may result in an impairment. the carrying value of the trade name as of december 31, 2022 was $200 million.
our finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. impairment tests for these assets are only performed when a triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on its undiscounted future cash flows. if the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recorded. fair values are determined based on quoted market prices, discounted cash flows or external appraisals, as appropriate. if impairment indicators are present, the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations. see note 7 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for details of finite-lived intangible asset impairments.
self-insurance accruals we base self-insurance reserves on actuarial estimates, which are determined with the assistance of a third-party actuary through a complex process that includes the application of various actuarial methods and assumptions. the process incorporates actual loss experience and judgments about expected future development based on historical experience, recent and projected trends in claim frequency and severity, and changes in claims handling practices, among other factors.
workers' compensation, automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take a number of years to resolve. consequently, actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to resolve a claim. several factors can affect the actual cost, or severity, of a claim, including:
•length of time a claim remains open;
•trends in healthcare costs;
•results of any related litigation; and
•changes in legislation.
furthermore, claims may emerge in a future year for events that occurred in a prior policy period at a rate that differs from actuarial projections. all these factors can result in revisions to actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results.
due to the complexity and inherent uncertainty associated with the estimation of our workers' compensation, automobile and general liability claims, the third-party actuary develops a range of expected losses. we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate; however, actual experience in claims frequency and/or severity of claims could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we also sponsor several health and welfare insurance plans for our employees. liabilities and expenses related to these plans are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans, global health events, anticipated utilization by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation. we believe our estimates are reasonable and appropriate. actual experience may differ materially from these estimates and, therefore, produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results.
self-insurance reserves as of december 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in millions):
our total reserves related to prior year claims decreased by $5 million in 2022 and increased by $34 million in 2021. a five percent deterioration or improvement in both the assumed claim severity and claim frequency rates used to estimate our self-insurance reserves would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $290 million, respectively, in our reserves and expenses as of, and for the year ended, december 31, 2022.
pension and other postretirement medical benefits our pension and postretirement medical benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. these assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, inflation, compensation increases, expected returns on plan assets, mortality rates, regulatory requirements and other factors. the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans represent our best estimates. we believe that they are reasonable, based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends.
differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and future expenses. the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are:
•changes in the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations as of the measurement date;
•changes in demographic assumptions, including mortality;
•differences in participant experience from demographic assumptions; and
•changes in coordinating benefits with plans not sponsored by ups.
we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of a corridor (defined as 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans' projected benefit obligations) immediately within income upon remeasurement of a plan. other components of pension expense (referred to as "ongoing net periodic benefit cost"), primarily service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets, are reported on a quarterly basis.
the following sensitivity analysis shows the impact of a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and return on assets for our pension and postretirement benefit plans, and the resulting increase (decrease) in our obligations and expense as of, and for the year ended, december 31, 2022 (in millions):

depreciation, residual value and impairment of property, plant and equipment as of december 31, 2022, we had $34.7 billion of net property, plant and equipment, the most significant category of which was aircraft. in accounting for property, plant and equipment, we make estimates of the expected useful lives and residual values. we evaluate the useful lives of our property, plant and equipment based on our usage, maintenance and replacement policies, and taking into account physical and economic factors that may affect the useful lives of the assets. our accounting policy for property, plant and equipment is set out in note 1 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.
we monitor our long-lived assets for indicators of impairment which may include, but are not limited to, a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. if circumstances are present that indicate the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable, we then perform impairment testing at the asset group level.
asset groups represent the lowest level at which independent cash flows can be identified. determining the asset group requires judgment and changes in the way asset groups are defined could have material impact to the results of impairment testing. we perform recoverability testing by comparing the undiscounted cash flows of the asset group to the carrying value of the asset group. if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recorded. fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows or external appraisals, as appropriate. details of long-lived asset impairments are included in note 4 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in estimating the useful lives and expected residual values of aircraft, we consider actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types and volume projections for our air products. adverse changes in volume forecasts, or a shortfall in our actual volume compared with our projections, could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand. this situation could lead to an excess of aircraft, resulting in an impairment charge or reduction in expected useful life that may result in increased depreciation expense.
revisions to estimates of useful lives and residual values could also be caused by changes to our maintenance programs, governmental regulations, operational intentions, or market prices for new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions, and adjust them, as necessary, on a prospective basis through depreciation expense. in the fourth quarter of 2022, we reduced the estimated residual value of our md-11 aircraft and associated engines to zero based on updated operational plans for these aircraft and our expectations for their eventual disposal. in connection with this change in estimate, during the fourth quarter of 2022 we recorded a one-time depreciation charge to adjust the residual value of our fully-depreciated md-11 aircraft. refer to note 4 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for information on the impact to our results of operations.
fair value measurements in the normal course of business, we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk, including derivatives, marketable securities and debt. certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value, principally derivatives, marketable securities and certain other investments. these financial instruments are measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis based upon a fair value hierarchy (levels 1, 2 and 3). fair values are based on listed market prices (level 1), when such prices are available. to the extent that listed market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on other relevant factors, including dealer price quotations (level 2). if listed market prices or other relevant factors are not available, inputs are developed from unobservable data reflecting our own assumptions and include situations where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability (level 3). certain financial instruments, including over-the-counter derivative instruments, are valued using pricing models that consider, among other factors, contractual and market prices, correlations, time value, credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors. changes in the fixed income, foreign currency exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future, potentially affecting our results of operations. further information on our accounting polices relating to fair value measurements can be found in note 1 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.
as of december 31, 2022, the majority of our financial instruments were categorized as either level 1 or level 2. refer to notes 3, 9 and 17 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for further information on these instruments. a quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates is presented in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk section of this report.
our pension and postretirement plan assets include investments in hedge funds, as well as private debt, private equity and real estate funds, which are primarily measured using net asset value ("nav") as a practical expedient for fair value, as appropriate. these investments were valued at $9.6 billion as of december 31, 2022. in order to estimate nav, we evaluate audited and unaudited financial reports from fund managers and make adjustments for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and december 31st. these investments are not actively traded, and their values can only be estimated using these assumptions. if our estimates of activity changed, this could have a material impact on the reported value of these investments and on the return on assets that we report. refer to note 5 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for further information on our pension and postretirement plan assets.
certain non-financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. these assets are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of an impairment or when an asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in accounting for business acquisitions, we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires judgment, especially with respect to identified intangible assets as there may be limited or no observable transactions within the market, requiring us to develop internal models to estimate fair value. for example, estimating the fair value of identified intangible assets may require us to develop valuation assumptions, including but not limited to, future expected cash flows from these assets, synergies and the cost of capital. certain inputs require us to determine assumptions that are reflective of a market participant view of fair value. changes in any of these assumptions may materially impact the amount we recognize for identifiable assets and liabilities, in addition to the residual amount allocated to goodwill.
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction, tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as tax, interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.
we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. if recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. however, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. once it is determined that the position meets the recognition threshold, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. the difference between the amount of recognizable tax benefit and the total amount of tax benefit from positions filed or to be filed with the tax authorities is recorded as a liability for uncertain tax benefits. it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. we reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.

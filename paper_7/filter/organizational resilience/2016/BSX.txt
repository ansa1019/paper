item 7.     management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information management believes to be relevant to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of boston scientific corporation and its subsidiaries. for full understanding of financial condition and results of operations, you should read this discussion along with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in item 8 of this annual report.
executive summary financial highlights and trends in 2016, we generated net sales of $8.386 billion, as compared to $7.477 billion in 2015, an increase of $909 million, or 12 percent. our net sales were unfavorably impacted by $99 million from foreign currency fluctuations in 2016, as compared to 2015. excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, our net sales increased $1.008 billion, or 12 percent, as compared to the prior year.1 this increase included net sales of approximately $236 million in 2016, with no prior year period related net sales, due to the ams portfolio acquisition and the endochoice holdings, inc. (endochoice) acquisition. refer to the business and market overview section for further discussion of our net sales by global business.
our reported net income in 2016 was $347 million, or $0.25 per diluted share. our reported results for 2016 included intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition-related net charges, restructuring and restructuring-related net charges, litigation-related charges, and amortization expense totaling $1.187 billion (after-tax), or $0.86 per share. excluding these items, net income for 2016 was $1.534 billion, or $1.11 per share.1our reported net loss in 2015 was $239 million, or $0.18 per share. our reported results for 2015 included intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition-related net charges, restructuring and restructuring-related net charges, litigation-related charges, pension termination charges, debt extinguishment charges, discrete tax items, and amortization expense totaling $1.506 billion (after-tax), or $1.11 per share. excluding these items, net income for 2015 was $1.267 billion, or $0.93 per share1.

business and market overview cardiovascular interventional cardiology our interventional cardiology division develops and manufactures technologies for diagnosing and treating coronary artery disease and other cardiovascular disorders including structural heart conditions. product offerings include coronary stents, including drug-eluting and bare metal stent systems, balloon catheters, rotational atherectomy systems, guide wires, guide catheters, embolic protection devices, crossing and re-entry devices for the treatment of chronically occluded coronary vessels, diagnostic catheters, and intravascular ultrasound (ivus) imaging systems. our structural heart product offerings include a device for transcatheter aortic valve replacement and a device designed to close the left atrial appendage in patients with atrial fibrillation that are at risk for ischemic stroke.
our worldwide net sales of interventional cardiology products were $2.281 billion for 2016, or approximately 27 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year. our worldwide net sales of interventional cardiology products increased $248 million, or 12 percent, in 2016, as compared to 2015. excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a $34 million negative impact on our interventional cardiology net sales in 2016, as compared to 2015, net sales of these products increased $282 million, or 13 percent. this year-over-year increase was primarily related to sales of our drug-eluting stents, led by our ongoing global launch of the synergytm stent, our watchmantm device following the u.s. commercial launch during the first quarter of 2015 and our lotustm valve system in the eu, along with operational growth in our pci guidance system product offerings.
worldwide sales from our drug-eluting coronary stents were $1.199 billion during 2016, as compared to $1.074 billion during 2015, representing a significant portion of our interventional cardiology net sales. our drug-eluting stent systems include our next generation synergy everolimus-eluting platinum chromium coronary stent system and our promus premiertm everolimus-eluting platinum chromium coronary stent system, both of which are designed to provide physicians with improved drug-eluting stent performance in treating patients with coronary artery disease. synergy features an ultra-thin abluminal (outer) bioabsorbable polymer coating, while promus premiertm features a unique customized platinum chromium alloy stent architecture and an enhanced stent delivery system. we received fda approval of the synergytm stent technology and japanese regulatory approval in the fourth quarter of 2015.
our structural heart product offerings include our lotustm valve system, a device for transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and our watchmantm device designed to close the left atrial appendage in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who are at risk for ischemic stroke. the lotus valve system consists of a stent-mounted tissue valve prosthesis and catheter delivery system for guidance and placement of the valve.
the original lotus valve system as well as our next generation lotus edgetm system are ce-marked in the european union (eu), and in the u.s. they are investigational devices and not commercially available. in october 2016, we suspended our limited launch and initiated a voluntary removal of field inventory of the lotus edgetm system due to reports that, in some cases, the device could not be fully locked during the procedure due to premature release of a pin connecting the lotus edgetm valve to the delivery system. in february 2017, we initiated a voluntary removal of all lotustm valve devices, including lotus with depth guardtm, from global commercial and clinical sites due to reports of premature release of a pin connecting the lotustm valve to the delivery system. as with the prior announced suspension of our lotus edgetm valve system device, we believe that the issue is caused by excess tension in the pin mechanism introduced during the manufacturing process. we expect to bring the lotustm valve platform back to market in europe and other regions in the fourth quarter of 2017. we anticipate filing the u.s. pma submission for the lotus edgetm valve system, the next generation platform, in the fourth quarter of 2017, with a u.s. launch planned for mid-2018.
the watchman left atrial appendage closure technology (watchman) is the first device studied in a randomized clinical trial to offer an alternative to warfarin, and is marketed in ce-mark countries and other international countries, as well as the u.s. following fda approval in march 2015. we believe that watchman will be the only laac technology commercially available in the u.s. for multiple years. in november 2015, we received ce mark for our next generation device, watchman flxtm. shortly after approval, we began a european initial market release of watchman flx. the initial market release was suspended near the end of the first quarter of 2016 due to a higher than expected rate of device embolization. following an extensive data evaluation, we have decided to pursue potential design enhancements prior to returning a next generation device to market.
on december 12, 2016, we completed the acquisition of certain manufacturing assets and capabilities of the neovasc, inc. (neovasc) advanced biological tissue business and made a 15 percent equity investment in neovasc for a total upfront cash payment of $75
million. with this acquisition, we will integrate certain manufacturing assets and biologic tissue capabilities into our structural heart business for use in the manufacturing of the lotus valve system and future heart valve technologies within our interventional cardiology business. we expect this integration to be substantially completed by the end of 2018.
peripheral interventions our peripheral interventions (pi) product offerings include stents, balloon catheters, wires, peripheral embolization devices and other devices used to diagnose and treat peripheral vascular disease, along with products to treat, diagnose and ease various forms of cancer.
our worldwide net sales of pi products were $1.011 billion for 2016, or approximately 12 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year. our worldwide net sales of pi products increased $107 million, or 12 percent, in 2016, as compared to 2015. excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had an $11 million negative impact on our worldwide pi net sales in 2016, as compared to 2015, net sales of these products increased $118 million, or 12 percent. this year-over-year increase was primarily driven by revenues from our atherectomy and thrombectomy systems, as well as growth in our core pi franchises, particularly our stent franchise following fda approval and launch of our innovatm vascular self-expanding stent system in the u.s. and japan, our interventional oncology franchise and our drug-eluting product franchise.
on december 31, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the interventional radiology business of celonova biosciences (celonova). the acquisition includes drug-eluting microspheres designed to be loaded with chemotherapy drugs for delivery to cancerous tumors, and spherical embolic products used to treat uterine fibroids and other conditions. we are in the process of integrating celonova into our peripheral interventions business and expect to be substantially complete by the second half of 2017.
rhythm management cardiac rhythm management our cardiac rhythm management (crm) business develops, manufactures and markets a variety of implantable devices including implantable cardioverter defibrillator (icd) systems and implantable cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators, including the world's first and only commercially available subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator, the s-icd system, and pacemaker systems that monitor the heart and deliver electricity to treat cardiac abnormalities. in addition, in most geographies, we monitor device performance remotely, allowing for more frequent monitoring in order to guide treatment decisions.
our worldwide net sales of crm products were $1.850 billion for 2016, or approximately 22 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year. our worldwide net sales of crm products increased $43 million, or two percent, in 2016, as compared to 2015. excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a $17 million negative impact on our crm net sales in 2016, as compared to 2015, net sales of these products increased $60 million, or three percent. this year-over-year increase was primarily driven by strong global pacemaker growth including the u.s. launch of the accoladetm family of magnetic resonance imaging (mri) safe pacemakers and the ingevitytm mri pacing lead in the u.s., global growth from our quadripolar cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemakers (crt-p), global s-icd sales growth and benefits from our sales collaboration agreement with preventice solutions, inc., (preventice). in the u.s., the fourth quarter of 2016 represented our second full quarter of u.s. mri pacemaker commercialization, the third quarter of commercialization for our acuitytm x4 quadripolar lv pacing lead in both the cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (crt-d) and crt-p franchises, and global commercialization of our emblemtm mri s-icd system. these combined launches more than offset lower volumes of replacement procedures for our defibrillators due to their extended longevity and pressure from competitor high voltage mri technologies primarily in the u.s. on april 30, 2015, we acquired a 27 percent ownership interest in preventice, which includes 18.5 percent of preventice's common stock. preventice is a privately-held company headquartered in minneapolis, mn, and a leading developer of mobile health solutions and services. in addition to the equity agreement, we entered into a commercial agreement with preventice, under which we became preventice's exclusive, worldwide sales and marketing representative. in october 2016, we notified preventice of our intent to terminate the commercial agreement and will transition the sales force back to preventice in 2017 under the terms of the agreement.
the following are the components of our crm net sales:
defibrillator systems              $1,274                      $1,313
pacemaker systems       576                         494
electrophysiology our electrophysiology business develops less-invasive medical technologies used in the diagnosis and treatment of rate and rhythm disorders of the heart. our leading products include the blazertm line of ablation catheters, designed to deliver enhanced performance and responsiveness, and the rhythmiatm mapping system, a next-generation, catheter-based, 3-d cardiac mapping and navigation solution designed to help diagnose and treat a variety of arrhythmias.
our worldwide net sales of electrophysiology products were $243 million for 2016, or approximately three percent of our consolidated net sales for the year. our worldwide net sales of electrophysiology products increased $10 million, or four percent, in 2016, as compared to 2015. excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a $3 million negative impact on our electrophysiology net sales in 2016, as compared to 2015, net sales of these products increased $13 million, or five percent. this year-over-year increase was primarily driven by increased sales of our rhythmia mapping system and related products. in the first quarter of 2016, we initiated a full european launch of our blazer intellanavtm oi catheter which is used with our rhythmia mapping system and, in july of 2016, we received fda approval for this same catheter. in the second quarter of 2016, we received fda approval for intellanavtm xp and the intellanav mifitm xp navigation-enabled ablation catheters that are used with the rhythmia mapping system. we also received fda approval for our blazertm open irrigated system with atrial flutter indication and began full u.s. commercialization in the second quarter of 2016. our global roll-out of our rhythmia mapping system, including early europe commercialization of our next generation rhythmiatm hdx system late in the fourth quarter, along with continued global expansion of our new navigation enabled therapeutic catheter portfolio, will continue as we expand our global rhythmia installed base.
medsurg endoscopy our endoscopy division develops and manufactures devices to treat a variety of medical conditions including diseases of the digestive and pulmonary systems. our worldwide net sales of endoscopy products were $1.440 billion for 2016, or approximately 17 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year. our worldwide net sales of endoscopy products increased $134 million, or 10 percent, in 2016, as compared to 2015. excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative $9 million impact on our endoscopy net sales in 2016 as compared to 2015, net sales of these products increased $143 million, or 10 percent. this year-over-year increase was primarily driven by growth across several of our key product franchises, including our biliary device franchise with our spyglasstm ds direct visualization system and our axios stent and electrocautery-enhanced delivery system for endoscopic ultrasound-guided transmural drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts; our metal stent franchise driven by our biliary wallflex® product family; and our hemostasis franchise, featuring our resolutiontm and resolution 360tm clips. this increase also includes revenue of approximately $10 million with no prior year period related net sales, due to the endochoice acquisition in november 2016, as described below.
on november 22, 2016, we completed our acquisition of endochoice. endochoice is an alpharetta, georgia based company focused on the development and commercialization of infection control products, pathology services and single-use devices for specialists treating a wide range of gastrointestinal (gi) conditions. we began the process of integrating endochoice into our endoscopy business in the fourth quarter of 2016 and expect to be substantially complete by the end of 2017.
on november 1, 2016, we acquired the lumenrtm tissue retractor system from lumenr llc (lumenr), a privately held newark, california based company. the lumenrtm tissue retractor system is currently in development for use during endoscopic resection of lesions in the colon, esophagus or stomach.
on april 2, 2015, we acquired xlumena, inc. (xlumena), a medical device company that developed minimally invasive devices for endoscopic ultrasound (eus) guided transluminal drainage of targeted areas within the gastrointestinal tract. in 2016, we completed the integration of xlumena into our endoscopy business.
urology and pelvic health our urology and pelvic health division develops and manufactures devices to treat various urological and pelvic conditions, such as kidney stones, benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph), erectile dysfunction, male incontinence, pelvic floor disorders, abnormal uterine bleeding, and uterine fibroids and polyps. our worldwide net sales of urology and pelvic health products were $1.005 billion for 2016, or approximately 12 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year. our worldwide net sales of urology and pelvic health products increased $312 million, or 45 percent, in 2016, as compared to 2015. excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative $18 million impact on our urology and pelvic health net sales in 2016, as compared to 2015, net sales of these products increased $330 million, or 45 percent. this year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to revenue of approximately $226 million with no prior year period related net sales, due to the ams portfolio acquisition in august 2015, along with growth across all of our other global franchises, including our pelvic floor franchise as a result of market share gains primarily driven by a competitor exiting the market during the first quarter of 2016.
on november 15, 2016, we completed the acquisition of the gynecology and urology portfolio of distal access, llc (distal), a salt lake city based company that designs minimally invasive medical devices. the portfolio includes the resectrtm tissue resection device, a single-use solution designed to remove uterine polyps. we began the process of integrating the resectr device into our urology and pelvic health business during the fourth quarter of 2016 and expect to be substantially complete by the end of 2017.
on august 3, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the american medical systems male urology portfolio (ams portfolio acquisition), which includes the men's health and prostate health businesses, from endo international plc. the ams male urology portfolio was integrated with our formerly named urology and women's health business, and the joint businesses became urology and pelvic health. the integration was substantially complete by the end of 2016.
neuromodulation our neuromodulation business offers the precisiontm, precision spectratm, precision montagetm and precision novitm spinal cord stimulator (scs) systems, used for the management of chronic pain, and our vercisetm deep brain stimulation (dbs) system in various international regions such as europe, latin america and asia pacific for the treatment of parkinson's disease, tremor and intractable primary and secondary dystonia, a neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions. our worldwide net sales of neuromodulation products were $556 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, or approximately seven percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31, 2016. our worldwide net sales of neuromodulation products increased $55 million, or 11 percent, in 2016, as compared to 2015. excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative $7 million impact on our neuromodulation net sales in 2016, as compared to 2015, net sales of these products increased $62 million, or 12 percent. the year-over-year increase was primarily driven by share gains from our montagetm system, continued adoption of the precision spectratm scs system in the u.s. and increased net sales in europe, driven by our vercisetm dbs systems and non-rechargeable precision novitm scs system.
on july 27, 2016, we acquired cosman medical, inc. (cosman), a privately held manufacturer of radiofrequency ablation systems, expanding our neuromodulation portfolio and offering physicians treating patients with chronic pain a wider choice of non-opioid therapeutic options. we are in the process of integrating cosman into our neuromodulation business, and expect the integration to be substantially complete by the end of 2017.
emerging markets as part of our strategic imperatives to drive global expansion, described in item 1 of this annual report, we are seeking to grow net sales and market share by expanding our global presence, including in emerging markets. we define emerging markets as including 20 countries that we believe have strong growth potential based on their economic conditions, healthcare sectors, and our global capabilities. we are seeking to expand our presence and strengthen relationships in order to grow net sales and market share within our emerging markets, and we have increased our investment in infrastructure in these countries in order to maximize opportunities. our emerging markets revenue grew nine percent, as compared to the prior year, and was approximately 10 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2016. excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative impact of 11 percent, net sales in these markets grew 20 percent.
results of operations net sales we manage our global businesses on a constant currency basis, and we manage market risk from currency exchange rate changes at the corporate level. management excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for purposes of reviewing revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and comparison to past operating performance. to calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we convert current period and prior period net sales from local currency to u.s. dollars using standard internal currency exchange rates held constant for each year.
the following table provides our net sales by global business and the relative change on an as reported and constant currency basis. the constant currency growth rates in the tables below can be recalculated from our net sales presented in note o - segment reporting to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report. net sales that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and net sales from divested businesses are not financial measures prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a replacement for, the most directly comparable gaap financial measure. refer to additional information of this item 7 for a further discussion of management's use of this non-gaap financial measure.

refer to executive summary for further discussion of our net sales and a comparison of our 2016 and 2015 net sales.
in 2015, we generated net sales of $7.477 billion, as compared to $7.380 billion in 2014, an increase of $97 million, or one percent. our net sales were unfavorably impacted by $505 million from foreign currency fluctuations in 2015 as compared to 2014. excluding the impact of foreign currency and sales from divested businesses, our net sales increased $606 million, or eight percent, as compared to the prior year. this increase was due primarily to constant currency increases in net sales from our urology and pelvic health business of $193 million, primarily due to the ams portfolio acquisition; from our interventional cardiology business of $150 million; from our peripheral interventions business of $114 million; and from our endoscopy business of $79 million.
gross profit our gross profit was $5.962 billion in 2016, $5.304 billion in 2015, and $5.170 billion in 2014. as a percentage of net sales, our gross profit increased to 71.1 percent in 2016, as compared to 70.9 percent in 2015 and 70.1 percent in 2014. the following is a reconciliation of our gross profit margins and a description of the drivers of the change from period to period:
gross profit - prior year                                               70.9   %     70.1   %
net impact of foreign currency                                          (0.9   )%     0.5   %
gross profit - current year                                             71.1   %     70.9   %
the primary factor contributing to the increase in our gross profit margin for 2016, as compared to 2015, was the positive impact of cost reductions as a result of our restructuring and other process improvement programs. partially offsetting these factors was the net negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and other inventory charges and period expenses. the increase in our gross profit margin for 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily resulted from manufacturing cost reductions as a result of our restructuring and other process improvement programs. partially offsetting these factors was the net negative impact of pricing declines related primarily to sales of our drug-eluting stent and crm products. in addition, in connection with the accounting for the ams portfolio acquisition, we adjusted acquired inventory from manufacturing cost to fair value. the step-up in value is amortized through gross profit over an average estimated inventory turnover period. we recorded increased cost of $22 million in 2016 and $36 million in 2015 associated with the step-up.
operating expenses the following table provides a summary of certain of our operating expenses:
% of net                       % of net                       % of net research and development expenses                    920        11.0      %         876        11.7      %         817        11.1      %
selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses in 2016, our sg&a expenses increased $226 million, or eight percent, as compared to 2015, and were 140 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. this decrease in sg&a as a percentage of sales was primarily driven by the benefit of our targeted initiatives focused on reducing sg&a, as well as the reduction in expenses resulting from the suspension of the medical device excise tax, which was substantially reinvested into our strategic growth initiatives. the medical device excise tax was temporarily suspended in december 2015 through december 31, 2017.
in 2015, our sg&a expenses decreased $29 million, or one percent, as compared to 2014, and were 90 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. this decrease was driven by the impacts of our foreign currency fluctuations and declines in spending as a result of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives. we recorded $78 million in 2015 and $72 million in 2014 related to the medical device excise tax.
research and development (r&d) expenses we remain committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses. in 2016, our r&d expenses increased $44 million, or five percent, as compared to 2015, and were 70 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. in 2015, our r&d expenses increased $59 million, or seven percent, as compared to 2014, and were 60 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales. the year-over-year increase in expenses was due primarily to investments across all of our businesses in order to maintain a healthy pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growth and increased cost related to recent acquisitions and alliances, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations.
royalty expense in 2016, our royalty expense increased $9 million, or 13 percent, as compared to 2015 and remained flat at approximately one percent of net sales for both periods. the increase in royalty expense was primarily due to increases in net sales of our drug-eluting coronary stent systems in 2016.
in 2015, our royalty expense decreased $41 million, or 37 percent, as compared to 2014, and was 60 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. the decrease relates primarily to the renegotiation of a royalty agreement in the second quarter of 2014 that resulted in a lower royalty rate structure.
amortization expense our amortization expense was $545 million in 2016, as compared to $495 million in 2015, an increase of $50 million or 10 percent. amortization expense was $495 million in 2015, as compared to $438 million in 2014, an increase of $57 million or 13 percent. the increases in each period were primarily due to amortizable intangible assets acquired in the ams portfolio acquisition on august 3, 2015.
amortization expense is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.
intangible asset impairment charges we have recorded intangible asset impairment charges, including impairments of in-process research and development, of $11 million in 2016, $19 million in 2015 and $195 million in 2014.
see note d - goodwill and other intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, for additional details related to our intangible asset impairment charges.
refer to critical accounting estimates for a discussion of key assumptions used in our goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing and future events that could have a negative impact on the recoverability of our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets. intangible asset impairment charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity.
contingent consideration expense we recorded a net expense related to the change in fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities of $29 million in 2016, a net expense of $123 million in 2015 and a net benefit of $85 million in 2014. refer to note b - acquisitions and strategic investments to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report for additional details related to our contingent consideration expenses.
contingent consideration expense is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.
restructuring-related activities and charges we recorded restructuring charges pursuant to our restructuring plans of $28 million during 2016, $26 million during 2015, and $69 million during 2014. in addition, we recorded expenses within other lines of our accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to our restructuring initiatives of $50 million during 2016, $57 million during 2015, and $48 million during 2014. restructuring and restructuring-related costs are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.
the 2016 restructuring plan is expected to result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $175 million to $225 million and reduce gross annual expenses by approximately $115 million to $150 million by the end of 2020 as program benefits are realized. the
2014 restructuring plan resulted in total pre-tax charges of $261 million and will reduce annual expenses by approximately $200 million. we expect a substantial portion of the savings to be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives.
we made cash payments of $82 million in 2016, $95 million in 2015, and $112 million in 2014 associated with our restructuring initiatives.
see note h - restructuring-related activities to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report for additional details on our restructuring plans.
litigation-related charges and credits we recorded net litigation-related charges in the amount of $804 million in 2016, $1.105 billion in 2015, and $1.036 billion in 2014. the net charges recorded in 2016 include primarily amounts related to transvaginal surgical mesh product liability cases and claims. the net charges recorded in 2015 include amounts primarily related to transvaginal surgical mesh product liability cases and claims and the charge related to the mirowski family venture llc (mirowski) lawsuit following a jury verdict that guidant corporation (guidant) breached their license agreement with mirowski. the net charges recorded in 2014 include a $600 million charge related to the agreement between our subsidiary, guidant and johnson & johnson signed on february 13, 2015, to settle the breach of merger agreement lawsuit brought by johnson & johnson, stemming from our acquisition of guidant. in exchange, we made aggregate payments totaling $600 million to johnson & johnson during 2015. the 2014 net charges also include amounts related to transvaginal surgical mesh product liability cases and claims and certain other items.
litigation related charges and credits are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.
we continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts, if any, that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and, therefore, additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future, which could materially adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and/or our ability to comply with our debt covenants. refer to note k - commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report for additional discussion of our material legal proceedings.
pension termination charges we recorded pension termination charges of $44 million during 2015 associated with the termination of the guidant retirement plan, a frozen defined benefit plan. we do not expect to incur any additional charges in the future related to the termination of the guidant retirement plan.
the pension termination charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.
gain on divestiture in january 2011, we closed the sale of our neurovascular business to stryker corporation. we recorded a pre-tax gain of $12 million during 2014 associated with the transaction. these divestiture-related gains are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.
interest expense our interest expense was $233 million in 2016 with an average borrowing rate of 4.0 percent, as compared to $284 million in 2015, with an average borrowing rate of 5.2 percent. interest expense in 2015 included a pre-tax charge of approximately $45 million associated with debt extinguishment charges, representing premiums, accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and investor discount costs net of interest rate hedge gains related to the early extinguishment of $1.000 billion of debt during the second quarter of 2015.
our interest expense was $284 million in 2015, with an average borrowing rate of 5.2 percent, as compared to $216 million in 2014, with an average borrowing rates of 4.8 percent. the increase was primarily due to the pre-tax charge of approximately $45 million associated with debt extinguishment charges, along with incremental debt to finance the ams portfolio acquisition offset by savings from refinancing our senior notes.
debt extinguishment charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. refer to liquidity and capital resources, note e - fair value measurements and note f - borrowings and credit arrangements to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report for information regarding our debt obligations.
other, net our other, net reflected expense of $37 million in 2016, expense of $39 million in 2015, and income of $8 million in 2014. the following are the components of other, net:
during 2016, we recognized net losses of $21 million due to equity method adjustments on investments and investment impairments which were partially offset by a gain on our neovasc investment. during 2015, we recognized net losses of $9 million due to equity method adjustments on investments and investment impairments. during 2014, we recognized gains of $19 million associated with the acquisition of iogyn, inc. related to previously held investments and other net gains related to our investment portfolio of $8 million. the acquisition-related gains from previously held investments are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. refer to note b - acquisitions and strategic investments to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report for information regarding our strategic investments.
tax rate the following table provides a summary of our reported tax rate:
impact of certain receipts/charges*        108.3     %   (53.5   )%    (64.5   )%
the change in our reported tax rate for 2016, as compared to 2015 and 2014, relates primarily to the impact of certain receipts and charges that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate, including intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition-related net charges, contingent consideration, litigation-related net charges, restructuring-related net charges, pension termination charges and debt extinguishment charges, as well as the impact of certain discrete tax items.
in 2016, these receipts and charges included intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition-related net charges, litigation-related net charges and restructuring-related net charges. our reported tax rate for 2016 was also affected by discrete items primarily related to the resolution of various uncertain tax positions through settlement or expiration of statute, offset by a charge related to changes in state apportionment.
in 2015, these receipts and charges included intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition-related net charges, litigation-related net charges, restructuring-related net charges, pension termination charges, and debt extinguishment charges. our reported tax rate for 2015 was also affected by discrete items primarily related to benefits due to settlement of various uncertain tax positions and reinstatement of certain tax legislation that has been retroactively applied.
in 2014, these receipts and charges included intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition- and divestiture-related net charges, litigation-related net charges and restructuring-related net charges. our reported tax rate for 2014 was also affected by discrete tax items primarily related to resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessing tax in certain jurisdictions and benefit due to change in uncertain tax positions due to a favorable court ruling, offset by a charge due to translation gain on previously taxed income.
we are contesting in u.s. tax court significant proposed adjustments from the internal revenue service (irs) related to its audit of our transfer pricing methodologies for the 2001 through 2007 tax years. the irs also proposed similar transfer pricing adjustments for the 2008 through 2010 tax years. we disagree with the transfer pricing methodologies being applied by the irs and we were scheduled to go to trial in the u.s. tax court in late july 2016. on july 19, 2016, we entered a stipulation of settled issues with the irs intended to resolve all of the aforementioned transfer pricing issues, as well as issues related to our transaction with abbott, for the 2001 through 2007 tax years. the stipulation of settled issues is contingent upon the irs office of appeals (irs appeals) applying the same basis of settlement to all transfer pricing issues for the company's 2008, 2009, and 2010 tax years, and if applicable, review by the united states congress joint committee on taxation. in october 2016, we reached an agreement in principle with irs appeals as to the resolution of the transfer pricing issues in 2008, 2009, and 2010 tax years, subject to additional calculations of tax as well as documentation to memorialize our agreement. in the event that the conditions in the stipulation of settled items are satisfied, we expect to make net tax payments of approximately $275 million, plus interest through the date of payment. if finalized, payments related to the resolution are expected in the next nine to 18 months. we believe that our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate as of december 31, 2016 and we do not expect to recognize any additional charges related to resolution of this controversy. however, the final resolution of these issues is contingent and if the stipulation of settled issues is not finalized, it could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
see note j - income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report for additional details on our tax rate and our tax litigation.
liquidity and capital resources based on our current business plan, we believe our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents, future cash generated from operations and access to capital markets and credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations, invest in our infrastructure, pay our legal-related liabilities, pay taxes due, fund possible mergers and/or acquisitions and service and repay our existing debt. please refer to our contractual obligations and commitments table for additional details on our future payment obligations and commitments.
as of december 31, 2016, we had $196 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, comprised of $42 million invested in money market and government funds and $154 million in short-term time deposits and interest bearing and non-interest bearing bank accounts. we invest excess cash on hand in short-term financial instruments that earn market interest rates while mitigating principal risk through instrument and counterparty diversification, as well as what we believe to be prudent instrument selection. we limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer. we also have full access to our $2.000 billion revolving credit facility and $240 million of available borrowings under our credit and security facility secured by our u.s. trade receivables as of december 31, 2016, both described below.
the following provides a summary and description of our net cash inflows (outflows) for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:
cash provided by operating activities                     $972             $600           $1,269
operating activities during 2016, cash provided by operating activities was $972 million, as compared to $600 million in 2015, an increase of $372 million or 62 percent. this increase was primarily driven by the increase in net income for 2016 compared to 2015, partially offset by approximately $100 million increase in litigation-related payments. during 2016, we made litigation-related payments primarily associated with the transvaginal surgical mesh product liability cases and to mirowski.
refer to note k - commitments and contingencies for additional information on litigation-related matters.
during 2015, we generated $600 million of cash from operating activities, as compared to $1.269 billion in 2014, a decrease of $669 million, or 53 percent. this decrease was primarily due to the $600 million of payments to johnson & johnson.
investing activities during 2016, cash used for investing activities was $887 million. our investing activities primarily included $408 million of payments, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions including cosman, endochoice, lumenr, distal and neovasc; along with $376 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment and $132 million of payments related to strategic investments, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of one of two buildings located in quincy, massachusetts for $29 million. we intend to invest approximately $300 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment during 2017.
during 2015, cash used for investing activities was $2.186 billion. our investing activities included $1.734 billion of payments net of cash acquired, for acquisitions, including the ams portfolio acquisition, celonova and xlumena; along with $266 million of payments related to strategic investments, including equity investments in preventice, inc. and frankenman medical equipment company. cash used for investing activities also included purchases of property, plant and equipment of $247 million.
during 2014, cash used for investing activities was $745 million. our investing activities included $486 million of payments, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions including iogyn and the interventional division of bayer ag; along with purchases of property, plant and equipment of $259 million.
financing activities our cash flows from financing activities reflect issuances and repayments of debt, payments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, and cash used to new share settle and stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs, as discussed in note l - stockholders' equity to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report. additionally, our financing activities included $65 million of contingent payments in 2016, $156 million of payments in 2015 and $34 million of payments in 2014 associated with our previous acquisitions.
our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in item 1a. risk factors of this annual report, some of which are outside our control. macroeconomic conditions, adverse litigation outcomes and other risk and uncertainties could limit our ability to successfully execute our business plans and adversely affect our liquidity plans.
debt we had total debt of $5.484 billion as of december 31, 2016 and $5.677 billion as of december 31, 2015 which consisted of the following:
revolving credit facility in april 2015, we entered into a new $2.000 billion revolving credit facility (the 2015 facility) with a global syndicate of commercial banks and terminated our previous $2.000 billion revolving credit facility. the 2015 facility matures in april 2020. there were no amounts borrowed under our current or prior revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2016 or december 31, 2015.
term loans as of december 31, 2016, we had an aggregate $750 million outstanding under our unsecured term loan facilities and $1.000 billion outstanding under these facilities as of december 31, 2015. these facilities include an unsecured term loan facility entered into in august 2013 (2013 term loan) which had $150 million outstanding as of december 31, 2016 and $250 million outstanding as of december 31, 2015, along with an unsecured term loan credit facility entered into in april 2015 (2015 term loan) which had $600 million outstanding as of december 31, 2016 and $750 million outstanding as of december 31, 2015.
our revolving credit facility and our term loan facilities require that we maintain certain financial covenants as outlined in note f - borrowings and credit arrangements to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report. as of and through december 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the required covenants. any inability to maintain compliance with these covenants could require us to seek to renegotiate the terms of our credit facility or seek waivers from compliance with these covenants, both of which could result in additional borrowing costs. further, there can be no assurance that our lenders would agree to such new terms or grant such waivers.
senior notes we had senior notes outstanding of $4.650 billion as of december 31, 2016 and as of december 31, 2015. our senior notes were issued in public offerings, are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. our senior notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations and rank on parity with each other. these notes are effectively junior to borrowings under our credit and security facility, to the extent if borrowed by our subsidiaries, and to liabilities of our subsidiaries.
on january 12, 2017, we used our existing credit facilities to repay the $250 million plus interest of our senior notes due in january 2017.
the debt maturity schedule for the significant components of our debt obligations as of december 31, 2016 is as follows:
note:   the table above does not include unamortized discounts associated with our senior notes, or amounts related to interest rate contracts used to hedge the fair value of certain of our senior notes or debt issuance costs.
other arrangements we maintained a $300 million credit and security facility secured by our u.s. trade receivables maturing on june 9, 2017. we had borrowings of $60 million outstanding under this facility as of december 31, 2016 and no borrowings outstanding as of december 31, 2015. on february 7, 2017, we amended the terms of this credit and security facility, including increasing the facility size to $400 million. this amendment retained a similar maximum leverage ratio requirement and extended the facility maturity to february 2019.
we also have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain european countries that we account for as sales under financial accounting standards board (fasb) accounting standards codification® (asc) topic 860, transfers and servicing. these agreements provide for the sale of accounts receivable to third parties, without recourse, of up to approximately $391 million as of december 31, 2016. we de-recognized $152 million of receivables as of december 31, 2016 at an average interest rate of 1.8 percent, and $151 million as of december 31, 2015 at an average interest rate of 2.4 percent.
in addition, we have uncommitted credit facilities with a commercial japanese bank that provide for borrowings, promissory notes discounting and receivables factoring of up to 21.000 billion japanese yen (approximately $180 million as of december 31, 2016). we de-recognized $149 million of notes receivable as of december 31, 2016 at an average interest rate of 1.6 percent and $132 million of notes receivable as of december 31, 2015 at an average interest rate of 1.6 percent. de-recognized accounts and notes are excluded from trade accounts receivable, net in the accompanying audited consolidated balance sheets.
we had outstanding letters of credit of $44 million as of december 31, 2016 and as of december 31, 2015. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, none of the beneficiaries had drawn upon the letters of credit or guarantees. we believe we will generate sufficient cash from operations to fund these arrangements and intend to fund these arrangements without drawing on the letters of credit, for additional details related to our debt, including our revolving credit facility, term loans, senior notes and other arrangements, see note f - borrowings and credit arrangements to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report.
equity during 2016 we received $111 million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans, as compared to $114 million in 2015 and $60 million 2014. proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock and in the exercise and stock purchase patterns of employees.
we repurchased 10 million shares for $125 million during 2014. no share repurchases were made in 2016 or 2015. as of december 31, 2016, we had remaining approximately $535 million authorized under our 2013 share repurchase program. there were approximately 248 million shares in treasury as of december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015.
stock-based compensation expense related to our stock ownership plans was $116 million in 2016, $107 million in 2015, and $103 million in 2014. stock-based compensation expense varies from period to period based upon, among other factors: the timing, number and fair value of awards granted during the period; forfeiture levels related to unvested awards; and employee contributions to our employee stock purchase plan.
contractual obligations and commitments the following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments, and is based on conditions in existence as of december 31, 2016.
unrecognized tax benefits (2)               577                   -                 -                   -                 -                   -                   577
(1)   in accordance with u.s. gaap, these obligations relate to expenses associated with future periods and are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.
the amounts in the table above with respect to lease obligations represent amounts pursuant to contractual arrangements for the lease of property, plant and equipment used in the normal course of business. purchase obligations relate primarily to non-cancellable inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business. royalty obligations reported above represent minimum contractual obligations under our current royalty agreements. the table above does not include $584 million of unrecognized tax benefits and $197 million of accrued interest and penalties, and other related items because the timing of their future cash settlement is uncertain. refer to note j - income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report for more information on these unrecognized tax benefits. in addition, the table above does not reflect our accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable of $961 million due to the timing of payment being uncertain. refer to note k - commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report for more information on our legal accrual.
with certain of our acquisitions, we acquired in-process research and development projects that require future funding to complete the projects. the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility or completion of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region. we estimate that the total remaining cost to complete the in-process research and development projects we acquired is between $25 million and $50 million. net cash inflows from the projects currently in development are expected to commence in 2017 through 2030, following the respective launches of these technologies in the u.s., europe and japan. certain of our acquisitions also involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. the table above does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts are uncertain. see note b - acquisitions and strategic investments to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with prior acquisitions and the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities as of december 31, 2016.
legal matters for a discussion of our material legal proceedings see note k - commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report.
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods. we have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap.
to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period. our actual results may differ from these estimates. we consider estimates to be critical if (i) we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if (ii) materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. the following are areas considered to be critical and require management's judgment: revenue recognition, bad debt reserves, inventory provisions, valuation of contingent consideration liabilities and intangible assets, goodwill valuation, legal and product liability accruals and income taxes.
see note a - significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report for additional information related to our accounting policies and our consideration of these critical accounting areas. in addition, see note b - acquisitions and strategic investments and note d - goodwill and other intangible assets for further discussion on the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and contingent consideration; note j - income taxes for further discussion on income tax related matters and note k - commitments and contingencies for further discussion on legal and product liability matters.
revenue recognition we generally allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired products for credit. we base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record these amounts as a reduction of revenue when we sell the initial product. in addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings. for these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer. uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.
many of our crm product offerings combine the sale of a device with our latitudetm patient management system, which represents a future service obligation. for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation, we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period. generally, we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations; therefore, we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available; otherwise, we use our best estimate of selling price. we allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. the use of alternative estimates of fair value could result in a different amount of revenue deferral.
inventory provisions we base our provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales. a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory in the future. further, the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, expired and obsolete inventory.
valuation of intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilities we base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, including in-process research and development, on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management's best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. further, for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration, we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to make in the future. we re-measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations. increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates, as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory, revenue or commercialization-based milestones. the use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections; growth rates; cash flows and discount rates and alternative estimated useful life assumptions, or probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical, regulatory or revenue-based milestones could result in different purchase price allocations, amortization expense, and contingent consideration expense in current and future periods.
we review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. if an impairment indicator exists, we test the intangible asset for recoverability. if the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable, we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified. we calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. the use of alternative assumptions, including estimated cash flows, discount rates, and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment. in addition, we test our indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite-lived assets, or more frequently if change in circumstance or indicators exist. we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with fasb asc topic 350, intangibles - goodwill and other (topic 350). if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, we write the carrying value down to the fair value.
goodwill valuation we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill. we test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. in 2016, we identified six operating segments including interventional cardiology, peripheral interventions, rhythm management, endoscopy, urology and pelvic health, and neuromodulation for purposes of identifying our reporting units. we then assessed whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. we identified rhythm management as having two components: cardiac rhythm management and electrophysiology.
for our 2016, 2015 and 2014 annual impairment assessment we identified seven reporting units, which align to our seven core businesses: interventional cardiology, peripheral interventions, cardiac rhythm management, electrophysiology, endoscopy, urology and pelvic health and neuromodulation. for our 2016 annual impairment assessment we aggregated the cardiac rhythm management and electrophysiology reporting units, components of the rhythm management operating segment, based on the criteria prescribed in fasb asc topic 350. these reporting units were aggregated due to a reorganization that commenced in 2015 that resulted in integrated leadership, shared resources and consolidation of certain sites in 2016.
in performing the goodwill impairment assessment, we utilize both the optional qualitative assessment and the two-step approach prescribed under fasb asc topic 350. beginning in 2016, the qualitative assessment was used for testing certain reporting units where fair value has historically exceeded carrying value by greater than 100%. all other reporting units were tested using the two-step approach described below. the qualitative assessment requires an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount based on an assessment of relevant events including macroeconomic factors, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance and other entity-specific factors. after assessing the totality of events, if it is determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the first and second steps of the goodwill impairment test are unnecessary. if it is determined that impairment is more likely than not, then we perform the first step of the two-step impairment test. in 2016, for all reporting units tested using the optional qualitative assessment, we concluded that it was not necessary to perform the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test. the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units to the fair value of these units.
for our 2016, 2015 and 2014 annual impairment assessment, for those reporting units for which a quantitative test was performed, we used only the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow (dcf) method, to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments. this approach calculates fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these after-tax cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. we selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets. we have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technology-based assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach. therefore, we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data are available to determine the fair value of our reporting units.
in applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill, we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates. the amount and timing of future cash flows within our dcf analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets, long range strategic plans and other estimates. the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our dcf analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable, perpetual growth of our reporting units. we use estimates of market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital (wacc) as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units' future expected cash flows.
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. if the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or negative, we evaluate whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. if we determine adverse qualitative factors exist that would indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists, we then perform the second step of the goodwill test. the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying value.
although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. the use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimates.
in the second quarter of 2016, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units and concluded the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. because our global electrophysiology reporting unit was identified as being at higher risk of potential goodwill impairment during our 2015 annual test, it was tested for impairment on a stand-alone basis in the second quarter of 2016, immediately prior to aggregating it with our global cardiac rhythm management reporting unit. the fair value of the stand-alone global electrophysiology reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately 36 percent. in comparison, the global electrophysiology reporting unit had excess fair value of approximately 28 percent as of our 2015 annual test. as of the date of our 2016 annual goodwill impairment test, the aggregated global electrophysiology and cardiac rhythm management operating segment (rhythm management) had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 70 percent and held $292 million of allocated goodwill. as such, it was not deemed at higher risk of future impairment. changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations, acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses could result in future impairments of goodwill within our reporting units.

legal and product liability accruals in the normal course of business, we are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, including intellectual property, breach of contract, securities litigation and product liability suits. in some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to sell our products. we accrue anticipated costs of settlement, damages, losses for product liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense, based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range. litigation and product liability matters are inherently uncertain and the outcomes of individual matters are difficult to predict and quantify. as such, significant judgment is required in determining our legal and product liability accruals. our estimates related to our legal and product liability accruals may change as additional information becomes available to us, including information related to the nature or existence of claims against us; trial court or appellate proceedings; and mediation, arbitration or settlement proceedings.
income taxes we provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions. in the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. therefore, judgment is required based on individual facts, circumstances and information available in determining whether or not based on technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. in our opinion, we have made adequate provisions for income taxes in determining our worldwide income tax position for all years subject to audit.
new accounting pronouncements see note q - new accounting pronouncements to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report for additional information on standards implemented since december 31, 2015 and standards to be implemented.
additional information use of non-gaap financial measures by boston scientific to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis, we disclose certain non-gaap financial measures, including adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share that exclude certain amounts, and adjusted net sales that exclude the impact of sales from divested businesses and/or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. these non-gaap financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states.
the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income is gaap net income (loss) and the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income per share is gaap net income (loss) per share. to calculate adjusted net sales that exclude sales from divested businesses and/or changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we convert actual net sales from local currency to u.s. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period and/or eliminate the net sales from businesses that were divested during the period. the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to constant currency growth rate and/or growth rates excluding sales from divested business is growth rate percentages using net sales on a gaap basis. reconciliations of each of these non-gaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap financial measure are included in the relevant sections of this annual report.
management uses these supplemental non-gaap financial measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to assess our performance relative to our competitors, and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. in addition, management uses these non-gaap financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments. the adjustments excluded from our non-gaap financial measures are consistent with those excluded from our operating segments' measures of net sales and profit or loss. these adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performance.
we believe that presenting adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, and adjusted net sales that exclude certain amounts, such as sales from divested businesses and/or the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, in addition to the corresponding gaap financial measures, provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results "through the eyes" of management. we further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.
the following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of these non-gaap financial measures as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual items:
•   intangible asset impairment charges - this amount represents write-downs of certain intangible asset balances during 2016, 2015 and 2014.we review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment and test our indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment. if we determine the carrying value of the amortizable intangible asset is not recoverable or we conclude that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-live asset is impaired, we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified. we exclude the impact of impairment charges from management's assessment of operating performance and from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. accordingly, management has excluded intangible asset impairment charges for purposes of calculating these non-gaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.
•   acquisition- and divestiture related net charges (credits) - these adjustments may consist of (a) contingent consideration fair value adjustments; (b) gains on previously held investments; (c) purchased and/or funded in-process research and development expenses incurred outside of a business combination; (d) due diligence, other fees, inventory step-up amortization, and integration and exit costs; and (e) separation costs and gains primarily associated with the sale of our neurovascular business in january 2011. the contingent consideration adjustments represent accounting adjustments to state contingent consideration liabilities at their estimated fair value. these adjustments can be highly variable depending on the assessed likelihood and amount of future contingent consideration payments. due diligence, other fees, inventory step-up amortization, and integration and exit costs include legal, tax, severance and other expenses associated with prior and potential future acquisitions and divestitures that can be highly variable and not representative of ongoing operations. separation costs and gains on the sale of a business unit primarily represent those associated with the neurovascular divestiture and are not representative of ongoing operations. accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-gaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.
•   restructuring and restructuring-related net charges (credits) - these adjustments represent severance and other direct costs associated with our restructuring plans. these restructuring plans each consist of distinct initiatives that are fundamentally different from our ongoing, core cost reduction initiatives in terms of, among other things, the frequency with which each action is performed and the required planning, resourcing, cost and timing. examples of such initiatives include the movement of business activities, facility consolidations and closures, and the transfer of product lines between manufacturing facilities, which, due to the highly regulated nature of our industry, requires a significant investment in time and cost to create duplicate manufacturing lines, run product validations, and seek regulatory approvals. restructuring initiatives generally take approximately two years to complete and have a distinct project timeline that begins subsequent to approval by our board of directors. in contrast to our ongoing cost reduction initiatives, restructuring initiatives typically result in duplicative cost and exit costs over this period of time, are one-time shut downs or transfers, and are not considered part of our core, ongoing operations. because these restructuring plans are incremental to the core activities that arise in the ordinary course of our business, management excluded these costs for purposes of calculating these non-gaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.
•   litigation-related net charges (credits) - these adjustments include certain significant product liability and other litigation-related charges and credits. we record these charges and credits, which we consider to be unusual or infrequent and significant, within the litigation-related charges line in our consolidated statement of operations; all other legal and product liability charges, credits and costs are recorded within selling general and administrative expenses. these amounts are excluded by management in assessing our operating performance, as well as from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-gaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.
•   debt extinguishment charges - this item represents premiums, accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and investor discount costs net of interest rate hedge gains related to the early extinguishment of $1.0 billion of senior notes during the second quarter of 2015. these adjustments are not expected to recur and do not reflect expected ongoing operating results. accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-gaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.
•   pension termination charges - this item represents charges associated with the termination of the guidant retirement plan, a frozen defined benefit plan. these charges are not expected to recur after 2015 and do not reflect expected ongoing operating results. accordingly, management has excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-gaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.
•   amortization expense - we record intangible assets at historical cost and amortize them over their estimated useful lives. amortization expense is excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and is also excluded from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. accordingly, management has excluded amortization expense for purposes of calculating these non-gaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.
•   discrete tax items - these items represent adjustments of certain tax positions, which were initially established in prior periods in conjunction with the purchase accounting for an acquisition or as a result of intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition-, divestiture-, restructuring- or litigation-related charges or credits. these adjustments do not reflect expected on-going operating results. accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-gaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.
adjusted net sales excluding the impact of sales from divested businesses and/or changes in foreign currency exchange rates
•   sales from divested businesses are primarily associated with the neurovascular divestiture and are not representative of ongoing operations. the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates is highly variable and difficult to predict. accordingly, management excludes the impact of sales from divested businesses and/or changes in foreign currency exchange rates for purposes of reviewing adjusted net sales to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.
adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share and adjusted net sales that exclude certain amounts, such as the sales from divested businesses and/or the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, are not in accordance with u.s. gaap and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable gaap financial measures. further, other companies may calculate these non-gaap financial measures differently than we do, which may limit the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.
rule 10b5-1 trading plans by executive officers periodically, certain of our executive officers adopt written stock trading plans in accordance with rule 10b5-1 under the exchange act and our own stock trading policy. a rule 10b5-1 trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amount, prices and dates (or formulas for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of our stock, including shares issued upon exercise of stock options or vesting of deferred stock units. these plans are entered into at a time when the person is not in possession of material non-public information about our company. we disclose details regarding individual rule 10b5-1 trading plans on the investor relations section of our website.
management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting as the management of boston scientific corporation, we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. we designed our internal control process to provide reasonable assurance to management and the board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2016. in making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control-integrated framework (2013 framework). based on our assessment, we believe that, as of december 31, 2016, our internal control over financial reporting is effective at a reasonable assurance level based on these criteria.
ernst & young llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. this report in which they expressed an unqualified opinion is included below.
/s/ michael f. mahoney                                /s/ daniel j. brennan michael f. mahoney                                   daniel j. brennan president and chief executive officer                executive vice president and chieffinancial officer report of independent registered public accounting firm the board of directors and shareholders of boston scientific corporation we have audited boston scientific corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2016 based on criteria established in internal control---integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework (the coso criteria). boston scientific corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
in our opinion, boston scientific corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2016, based on the coso criteria.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the consolidated balance sheets of boston scientific corporation as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2016 of boston scientific corporation and our report dated february 23, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

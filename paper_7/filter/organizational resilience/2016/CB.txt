effective the first quarter of 2016, reflecting our significantly larger and expanded operations, subsequent to the chubb corp acquisition, we implemented organizational changes that resulted in new business segments. we operate through six business segments: north america commercial p&c insurance, north america personal p&c insurance, north america agricultural insurance, overseas general insurance, global reinsurance, and life insurance. we have also redefined corporate to include all run-off asbestos and environmental (a&e) exposures, the results of run-off brandywine business, the results of westchester specialty operations for 1996 and prior years and certain other run-off exposures. prior period amounts contained in this report have been adjusted to conform to the new segment presentation.

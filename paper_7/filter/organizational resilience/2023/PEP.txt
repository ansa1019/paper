our business executive overview pepsico is a leading global convenient food and beverage company with a complementary portfolio of brands, including lay's, doritos, cheetos, gatorade, pepsi-cola, mountain dew, quaker and sodastream. through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories.
as a global company with deep local ties, we faced many of the same challenges in 2023 as our consumers, customers, and competitors across the world, including supply chain disruptions; inflationary pressures; shifting consumer preferences and behaviors; ongoing climate issues; a highly competitive operating environment; a rapidly changing retail landscape, including growth in e-commerce; continued macroeconomic and political volatility, including the deadly conflicts in ukraine and the middle east; and an evolving regulatory landscape.
to meet the challenges of today - and those of tomorrow - we are driven by an approach called pep+ (pepsico positive). pep+ is a strategic end-to-end transformation of our business, with sustainability at the center of how the company will strive to create growth and value, while inspiring positive change for the planet and people. pep+ guides how we are working to transform our business operations, and can be seen in such efforts as sourcing ingredients and making and selling products in a more sustainable way, to leveraging our more than one billion connections with consumers each day, to driving positive change across our value chain and inspiring people to make choices that are better for themselves and the planet.
positive agriculture: we are working to expand and share regenerative practices across seven million acres (approximately equal to the company's agricultural footprint, sustainably source key crops and ingredients, and improve the livelihoods of more people in our agricultural supply chain. understanding that scale and collaboration are essential to achieve these goals, in 2023, we expanded our partnership approach with new programs aimed at accelerating regenerative agriculture. this included a $120 million investment with walmart to support regenerative agriculture on more than two million acres of farmland in the united states and canada and a $216 million investment with three of the most well-respected farmer-facing organizations-practical farmers of iowa, the soil and water outcomes fund and the illinois corn growers association-to help drive adoption of regenerative agriculture practices across the united states.
technology is also a key enabler. through the third year of our positive agriculture outcomes accelerator, we invested in a variety of practical advancements with farmers across the globe, including weather stations in pakistan, on-farm water analysis in iraq and sprinkler irrigation systems in colombia.
table of contents we have continued developing new solutions, such as fertilizer produced from green hydrogen through a partnership with fertiberia in spain, aiming to reduce emissions by 15% in potato crops. and through innovations such as agroscout, which combines artificial intelligence and drone technology, we are able to identify crop diseases more efficiently, reducing pesticide use and improving crop yields.
positive value chain: we are working to help build a circular and inclusive value chain through actions aiming to: achieve net-zero emissions by 2040; become net water positive by 2030; and introduce more sustainable packaging into the value chain. our packaging goals include cutting virgin plastic per serving, using more recycled content in our plastic packaging, and scaling our reusable packaging offerings by 2030.
as we work to decarbonize our operations, alongside growing our use of electric and alternative low emission fuel vehicles, in 2023 we opened our first biomethane plant at our foods site in manisa, turkey, converting dried corn husks and potato peelings into biogas. we are also embedding pep+ into our new facilities, including our $320 million manufacturing facility in poland.
to support our customers on their sustainability journey, we launched pep+ partners for tomorrow in the united states to share training and initiatives on one platform. we are focused on reducing virgin plastic through new launches of bottles made with recycled plastic in india and the united arab emirates, while also expanding paper options, such as our quaker pots and walkers multipacks in the united kingdom. in december 2023, walkers sunbites announced the introduction of new packaging made with 50% recycled plastic. through 2023, we continued to scale new business models that require little or no single-use packaging, including the iconic sodastream, already sold in more than 40 countries. we also offer returnable bottles in mexico and spain and are engaged in reusable cup pilots, including in the united states.
we are also making progress on our diversity, equity and inclusion journey around the world. and we continue to empower each of our approximately 318,000 employees to make a positive impact in their communities through our global workforce volunteering program, one smile at a time.
positive choices: we continue working to evolve our portfolio of convenient food and beverage products so they continue to be positive for the planet and people, including by incorporating more diverse ingredients in both new and existing products, prioritizing legumes, plant-based proteins, whole grains and fruits and vegetables; expanding our position in the nuts and seeds category; accelerating our reduction of added sugars and sodium through the use of science-based targets across our portfolio; and cooking our food offerings with healthier oils. in 2023, we announced two new ambitious nutrition goals, which aim to further reduce sodium and purposefully deliver 145 billion portions of diverse ingredients annually by 2030.
we believe these priorities will position our company for long-term sustainable growth.
see also "item 1a. risk factors" for further information about risks and uncertainties that the company faces.
our operations see "item 1. business" for information on our divisions and a description of our distribution network, ingredients and other supplies, brands and intellectual property rights, seasonality, customers, competition, research and development, regulatory matters and human capital. in addition, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information about our divisions and geographic areas.
other relationships certain members of our board also serve on the boards of certain vendors and customers. these board members do not participate in our vendor selection and negotiations nor in our customer negotiations. our table of contents transactions with these vendors and customers are in the normal course of business and are consistent with terms negotiated with other vendors and customers. in addition, certain of our employees serve on the boards of pepsi bottling ventures llc and other affiliated companies of pepsico and do not receive incremental compensation for such services.
our business risks risks associated with commodities and our supply chain during 2023, we continued to experience significantly higher operating costs, including on transportation, labor and commodity (including energy) costs, which may continue in 2024. many of the commodities used in the production and transportation of our products are purchased in the open market. the prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. a number of external factors, including the ongoing conflict in ukraine, the inflationary cost environment, adverse weather conditions, supply chain disruptions (including raw material shortages) and labor shortages, have impacted and may continue to impact transportation, labor and commodity availability and costs. when prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results.
see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity prices.
risks associated with climate change certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of climate change, including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and potential carbon pricing programs. these new or increased legal or regulatory requirements, along with initiatives to meet our sustainability goals, could result in significant increased costs and additional investments in facilities and equipment. however, we are unable to predict the scope, nature and timing of any new or increased environmental laws and regulations and therefore cannot predict the ultimate impact of such laws and regulations on our business or financial results. we continue to monitor existing and proposed laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such laws or regulations.
risks associated with international operations we are subject to risks in the normal course of business that are inherent to international operations. during the periods presented in this report, certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in certain developing and emerging markets, operated in a challenging environment, experiencing unstable economic, political and social conditions, civil unrest, geopolitical conflicts, acts of war, terrorist acts, natural disasters, debt and credit issues and currency controls or fluctuations. we continue to monitor the economic, operating and political environment in these markets closely, including risks of additional impairments or write-offs, and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.
see notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impairment charges recognized in the years ended december 30, 2023 and december 31, 2022.
risks associated with the deadly conflict in ukraine in addition to the risks associated with international operations discussed above, we continue to face risks associated with the ongoing conflict in ukraine. the conflict and related sanctions imposed on russia by table of contents the united states and others has continued to result in worldwide geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty and has impacted our operations in ukraine and russia. we have suspended sales to our customers of pepsi-cola and certain of our other global beverage brands, our discretionary capital investments and advertising and promotional activities in russia, which has negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact our business. we continue to offer our other products in russia. our operations in russia accounted for 4% and 5% of our consolidated net revenue for the years ended december 30, 2023 and december 31, 2022, respectively. russia accounted for 3% and 4% of our consolidated assets and 35% and 32% of our accumulated currency translation adjustment loss as of december 30, 2023 and december 31, 2022, respectively. our operations in ukraine accounted for 0.3% and 0.2% of our consolidated net revenue for the years ended december 30, 2023 and december 31, 2022, respectively. ukraine accounted for 0.1% of our consolidated assets as of december 30, 2023 and december 31, 2022.
the conflict has resulted and could continue to result in volatile commodity markets, supply chain disruptions, increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to our information systems, reputational risks, heightened risks to employee safety, business disruptions (including labor shortages), significant volatility of the russian ruble, limitations on access to credit markets and other corporate banking services, including working capital facilities, reduced availability and increased costs for transportation, energy, packaging, raw materials and other input costs, environmental, health and safety risks related to securing and maintaining facilities, additional sanctions, export controls and other legislation or regulations (including restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from russia). the ongoing conflict could result in the temporary or permanent loss of assets, including the nationalization or expropriation of assets, result in additional impairment charges or significantly affect our ability to manage our operations in these markets which could result in the deconsolidation of such businesses. we cannot predict how and the extent to which the conflict will continue to affect our employees, customers, operations or business partners or impact our ability to achieve certain of our sustainability goals. the conflict has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect demand for our products and our global business. see notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the russia-ukraine conflict charges, including impairment charges, recognized in the year ended december 31, 2022.
the extent of the impact of these tragic events on our business remains uncertain and will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict, including the duration and scope of the conflict, regional instability and ongoing and additional financial and economic sanctions, export controls and other legislation imposed by governments. we will continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.
imposition of taxes and regulations on our products certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. these taxes and regulations vary in scope and form. for example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). further, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging, encourage waste reduction and increased recycling rates or facilitate the waste management process or restrict the sale of products in certain packaging.
we sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of table of contents packaging used vary by jurisdiction. because of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitations on our products or their packaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. in addition, taxes, regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. we continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations.
oecd global minimum tax numerous countries have agreed to a statement in support of the oecd model rules that propose a global minimum tax rate of 15%. certain countries, including european union member states, have enacted or are expected to enact legislation incorporating the agreed to global minimum tax with effect as early as 2024, and widespread implementation of a global minimum tax is expected as soon as 2025. as the legislation becomes effective in countries in which we do business, our taxes could increase and negatively impact our provision for income taxes. we will continue to monitor pending legislation and implementation by individual countries and evaluate the potential impact on our business in future periods.
retail landscape our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the continued growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. we have seen and expect to continue to see a further shift to e-commerce, online-to-offline and other online purchasing by consumers. we continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and seek to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities, such as expanding our direct-to-consumer business, and distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.
the retail industry also continues to be impacted by the actions and increasing power of retailers, including as a result consolidation of ownership resulting in large retailers or buying groups with increased purchasing power, particularly in north america, europe and latin america. we have seen and expect to continue to see retailers and buying groups impact our ability to compete in these jurisdictions. we continue to monitor our relationships with retailers and buying groups and seek to identify actions we may take to maintain mutually beneficial relationships and resolve any significant disputes and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.
see also "item 1a. risk factors," "executive overview" above and "market risks" below for more information about these risks and the actions we have taken to address key challenges.
risk management framework the achievement of our strategic and operating objectives involves risks, many of which evolve over time. to identify, assess, prioritize, address, manage, monitor and communicate these risks across the company's operations and foster a corporate culture of integrity and risk awareness, we leverage an integrated risk management framework. this framework includes the following:
•pepsico's board has oversight responsibility for pepsico's integrated risk management framework. one of the board's primary responsibilities is overseeing and interacting with senior management with respect to key aspects of the company's business, including risk assessment and risk mitigation of the company's top risks. throughout the year, the board and relevant committees of the board receive updates from management with respect to various enterprise risk table of contents management issues and dedicate a portion of their meetings to reviewing and discussing specific risk topics in greater detail, including risks related to cybersecurity, food safety, sustainability, human capital management (including diversity, equity and inclusion) and supply chain and commodity inflation. the board receives and provides feedback on regular updates from management regarding the company's top risks, including updates from members of management responsible for overseeing impacted areas (for example, the chief strategy and transformation officer and chief information security officer), governance processes associated with managing these risks, the status of projects to strengthen the company's risk mitigation efforts and recent incidents impacting the industry and threat landscape. given that cybersecurity risks can impact various areas of responsibility of the committees of the board, the board believes it is useful and effective for the full board to maintain direct oversight over cybersecurity matters. in evaluating top risks, the board and management consider short-, medium- and long-term potential impacts on the company's business, financial condition and results of operations, including looking at the internal and external environment when evaluating risks, risk amplifiers and emerging trends, and considers the risk horizon as part of prioritizing the company's risk mitigation efforts. the board receives updates through presentations, memos and other written materials, teleconferences and other appropriate means of communication, with numerous opportunities for discussion and feedback, and continuously evaluates its approach in addressing top risks as circumstances evolve. for example, as part of risk updates to the board and relevant committees during 2023, the board or its relevant committee were provided updates on the impact of disruptive events, such as the russia-ukraine conflict, supply chain disruption and commodity inflation. the board also receives periodic updates from external experts and advisers on global macroeconomic trends and conditions that may impact the company's strategy and financial performance, including geopolitical conflicts, economic instability, labor market trends, changing consumer behavior, retail disruption and digitalization.
the board has tasked designated committees of the board with oversight of certain categories of risk management, and the committees report to the board regularly on these matters.
◦the audit committee of the board reviews and assesses the guidelines and policies governing pepsico's risk management and oversight processes, and assists the board's oversight of financial, compliance and employee safety risks facing pepsico. the audit committee also assists the board's oversight of the company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and the chief compliance & ethics officer, who reports to the general counsel, meets regularly with the audit committee, including in executive session without management present;
◦the compensation committee of the board reviews pepsico's employee compensation policies and practices to assess whether such policies and practices could lead to unnecessary risk-taking behavior;
◦the nominating and corporate governance committee assists the board in its oversight of the company's governance structure and other corporate governance matters, including succession planning; and
◦the sustainability, diversity and public policy committee of the board assists the board in its oversight of pepsico's policies, programs and related risks that concern key sustainability (including climate change), diversity, equity and inclusion, and public policy matters.
•the pepsico risk committee (prc) meets regularly to identify, assess, prioritize and address top strategic, financial, operating, compliance, safety, reputational and other risks. the prc is also table of contents responsible for reporting progress on our risk mitigation efforts to the board and designated committees. the prc is comprised of a cross-functional, geographically diverse, senior management group, including pepsico's chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer, chief financial officer, general counsel, sector chief executive officers and the heads of corporate affairs, human resources, research & development, information technology, sustainability, strategy, transformation, international beverages, commercial, global operations, marketing and financial planning & analysis;
•division and key market risk committees, comprised of cross-functional senior management teams, meet regularly to identify, assess, prioritize and address division and country-specific business risks;
•pepsico's risk management office, which manages the overall risk management process, provides ongoing guidance, tools and analytical support to the prc and the division and key country risk committees, identifies and assesses potential risks and facilitates ongoing communication between the parties, as well as with pepsico's board, the audit committee of the board and other committees of the board;
•pepsico's internal audit department evaluates the ongoing effectiveness of our key internal controls through periodic audit and review procedures; and
•pepsico's compliance & ethics and law departments lead and coordinate our compliance policies and practices.
•pepsico's disclosure committee, comprised of the general counsel, controller and heads of internal audit, financial planning & analysis and investor relations, evaluates information from pepsico's integrated risk management framework as part of the disclosure committee's monitoring of the integrity and effectiveness of the company's disclosure controls and procedures. pepsico's risk oversight processes and disclosure controls and procedures are designed to appropriately escalate key risks to the board as well as to analyze potential risks for disclosure.
market risks we are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:
•commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy;
•foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and in the normal course of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements. see "item 1a. risk factors" for further discussion of our market risks.
the fair value of our derivatives fluctuates based on market rates and prices. the sensitivity of our derivatives to these market fluctuations is discussed below. see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivatives and our hedging policies. the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets is impacted by changes in market conditions, including interest rates and inflationary, deflationary and recessionary conditions. see "our critical accounting policies and table of contents estimates" for a discussion of the exposure of our goodwill and other intangible assets and pension and retiree medical plan assets and liabilities to risks related to market fluctuations.
inflationary, deflationary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our products. see "item 1a. risk factors" for further discussion.
commodity prices our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $1.7 billion as of december 30, 2023 and $1.8 billion as of december 31, 2022. at the end of 2023, the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2023 by $157 million, which would generally be offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.
foreign exchange our operations outside of the united states generated 43% of our consolidated net revenue in 2023, with mexico, canada, russia, china, the united kingdom, brazil and south africa, collectively, comprising approximately 25% of our consolidated net revenue in 2023. as a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases, foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. during 2023, unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 2 percentage points, primarily due to declines in the russian ruble and egyptian pound, partially offset by an appreciation of the mexican peso. currency declines against the u.s. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results.
in addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in argentina, brazil, china, mexico, the middle east, pakistan, russia, turkey and ukraine, and currency controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments.
our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $3.8 billion as of december 30, 2023 and $3.0 billion as of december 31, 2022. at the end of 2023, we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2023 by $371 million, which would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the fair value of the underlying exposure.
the total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $3.0 billion as of december 30, 2023 and $2.9 billion as of december 31, 2022.
interest rates our interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $1.3 billion as of december 30, 2023 and december 31, 2022. assuming year-end 2023 investment levels and variable rate debt, a 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have decreased our net interest expense in 2023 by $57 million due to higher cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments levels, as compared with our variable rate debt.
table of contents our financial results results of operations - consolidated review volume physical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan and the evaluation of our business performance. we believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. unit volume growth adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures. acquisitions and divestitures, when used in this report, reflect mergers and acquisitions activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. further, our fiscal 2022 results include an additional week (53rd reporting week). unit volume growth excludes the impact of the 53rd reporting week from 2022 results.
beverage volume includes volume of concentrate sold to independent bottlers and volume of finished products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks and allied brand products and joint venture trademarks sold by company-owned bottling operations. beverage volume also includes volume of finished products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks sold by our noncontrolled affiliates. concentrate volume sold to independent bottlers is reported in concentrate shipments and equivalents (cse), whereas finished beverage product volume is reported in bottler case sales (bcs). both cse and bcs convert all beverage volume to an 8-ounce-case metric. typically, cse and bcs are not equal in any given period due to seasonality, timing of product launches, product mix, bottler inventory practices and other factors. while our net revenue is not entirely based on bcs volume due to the independent bottlers in our supply chain, we believe that bcs is a better measure of the consumption of our beverage products. pbna, latam, europe, amesa and apac, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, make, market, distribute and sell ready-to-drink tea products through a joint venture with unilever (under the lipton brand name), and pbna, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells ready-to-drink coffee products through a joint venture with starbucks.
convenient food volume includes volume sold by us and our noncontrolled affiliates of convenient food products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks. internationally, we measure convenient food product volume in kilograms, while in north america we measure convenient food product volume in pounds. flna makes, markets, distributes and sells sabra refrigerated dips and spreads through a joint venture with strauss group.
consolidated net revenue and operating profit
2023                                                      2022                  change net revenue               $91,471                  $86,392                      6    %
operating profit          $11,986                  $11,512                      4    %
operating margin             13.1   %                 13.3   %              (0.2)
see "results of operations - division review" for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue.
operating profit grew 4% while operating margin declined 0.2 percentage points. operating profit growth was primarily driven by effective net pricing, productivity savings, an 11-percentage-point favorable impact of prior-year charges associated with the russia-ukraine conflict, and a 5-percentage-point favorable impact of prior-year impairment on intangible assets, investment and property, plant and equipment and other charges as a result of management's decision to reposition or discontinue the sale/
table of contents distribution of certain brands and to sell an investment (brand portfolio impairment charges). these impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 26-percentage-point unfavorable impact of the prior-year gain associated with the juice transaction, a 22-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, a decrease in organic volume and higher advertising and marketing expenses. corporate unallocated expenses reflect an increase in expenses related to our ongoing business initiatives and higher contributions to the pepsico foundation, inc. to fund charitable and social programs. the 53rd reporting week in the prior year reduced operating profit growth by 1 percentage point.
the operating margin decline primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of the prior-year gain associated with the juice transaction partially offset by the prior-year charges associated with the russia-ukraine conflict and the brand portfolio impairment charges.
2023                                                                                                   2022                    change other pension and retiree medical benefits income                         $250                     $132                     $118
other pension and retiree medical benefits income increased $118 million, primarily reflecting prior-year settlement charges of $318 million related to u.s. defined benefit plans. in addition, the increase in other pension and retiree medical benefits income reflects lower amortization of net losses on pension obligations and a higher rate of expected return on plan assets, partially offset by higher interest cost and recognition of fixed income losses on plan assets, all driven primarily by higher interest rates.
net interest expense and other decreased $120 million, primarily due to higher interest rates on average cash balances, gains on the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability and higher average cash balances, partially offset by higher interest rates on debt and higher average debt balances.
the reported tax rate increased 3.7 percentage points, primarily reflecting the prior-year adjustment to reserves for uncertain tax positions as a result of our agreement with the internal revenue service (irs) to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 to 2016 audit as well as the prior-year impact of the juice transaction.

non-gaap measures certain financial measures contained in this form 10-k adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with gaap. we use non-gaap financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. we believe presenting non-gaap financial measures in this form 10-k provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. we also believe presenting these measures in this form 10-k allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends.
we consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; charges associated with acquisitions and divestitures; gains associated with divestitures; asset impairment charges (non-cash); product recall-related impact; pension and retiree medical-related amounts, including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; and remeasurements of net monetary assets. prior to the fourth quarter of 2021, certain immaterial pension and retiree medical-related settlement and curtailment gains and losses were not considered items affecting comparability. pension and retiree medical-related service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs continue to be reflected in our core results. see below and "items affecting comparability" for a description of adjustments to our gaap financial measures in this form 10-k.
non-gaap information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap. in addition, our non-gaap financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-gaap measures presented by other companies.
table of contents the following non-gaap financial measures contained in this form 10-k are discussed below:
cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, gain associated with the juice transaction, impairment of intangible assets, other pension and retiree medical benefits income, net interest expense and other, provision for income taxes, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to pepsico, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, operating profit and net income attributable to pepsico per common share - diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, and the corresponding constant currency growth rates these measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 multi-year productivity plan (2019 productivity plan), charges associated with our acquisitions and divestitures, the gain associated with the juice transaction, impairment and other charges comprised of russia-ukraine conflict charges, brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges, product recall-related impact, the impact of settlement and curtailment gains and losses related to pension and retiree medical plans, a charge related to cash tender offers, tax benefit related to the irs audit and tax expense related to the tax cuts and jobs act (tcj act) (see "items affecting comparability" for a detailed description of each of these items). we also evaluate performance on operating profit and net income attributable to pepsico per common share - diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. in order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year u.s. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. we believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year.
organic revenue growth we define organic revenue growth as a measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures, and every five or six years, the impact of the 53rd reporting week, including in our 2022 financial results. adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures reflects mergers and acquisitions activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. we believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year.
see "net revenue and organic revenue growth" in "results of operations - division review" for further information.
free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. as such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. free cash flow is used by us primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure.
table of contents see "free cash flow" in "our liquidity and capital resources" for further information.
return on invested capital (roic) and net roic, excluding items affecting comparability we define roic as net income attributable to pepsico plus interest expense after-tax divided by the sum of quarterly average debt obligations and quarterly average common shareholders' equity. although roic is a common financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating roic. accordingly, the method used by management to calculate roic may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their roic.
we believe this metric serves as a measure of how well we use our capital to generate returns. in addition, we use net roic, excluding items affecting comparability, to compare our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance and reflects how management evaluates our operating results and trends. we define net roic, excluding items affecting comparability, as roic, adjusted for quarterly average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, after-tax interest income and items affecting comparability. we believe the calculation of roic and net roic, excluding items affecting comparability, provides useful information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of our performance to consider when evaluating our capital allocation efficiency.
see "return on invested capital" in "our liquidity and capital resources" for further information.

mark-to-market net impact we centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. these commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. these gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses.
table of contents restructuring and impairment charges
2019 multi-year productivity plan the 2019 productivity plan, publicly announced on february 15, 2019, will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. to build on the successful implementation of the 2019 productivity plan, in 2022, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above. as a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.65 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $2.9 billion. plan to date through december 30, 2023, we have incurred pre-tax charges of $1.9 billion, including cash expenditures of $1.4 billion. in our 2024 financial results, we expect to incur pre-tax charges and cash expenditures of approximately $500 million each. these charges will be funded primarily through cash from operations. we expect to incur the majority of the remaining pre-tax charges and cash expenditures through 2025, with the balance to be incurred through 2028. charges include severance and other employee costs, asset impairments and other costs.
see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our 2019 productivity plan. we regularly evaluate productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives discussed above and in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.
acquisition and divestiture-related charges acquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures. merger and integration charges include liabilities to support socioeconomic programs in south africa, gains associated with contingent consideration, employee-related costs, contract termination costs, closing costs and other integration costs. divestiture-related charges reflect transaction expenses, including consulting, advisory and other professional fees.

pension and retiree medical-related impact pension and retiree medical-related impact includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs, as well as curtailment gains.
see notes 7 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
tax benefit related to the irs audit we recognized a non-cash tax benefit resulting from our agreement with the irs to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. the agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019.
see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
tax expense related to the tcj act tax expense related to the tcj act reflects adjustments to the mandatory transition tax liability under the tcj act.
see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
charge related to cash tender offers as a result of the cash tender offers for some of our long-term debt, we recorded a charge primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes and loss on treasury rate locks used to mitigate the interest rate risk on the cash tender offers.
see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
our liquidity and capital resources we believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, working capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs, including with respect to our net capital spending plans. our primary sources of liquidity include cash from operations, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt, and cash and cash equivalents. these sources of cash are available to fund cash outflows that have both a short- and long-term component, including debt repayments and related interest payments; payments for acquisitions; operating leases; purchase, marketing, and other contractual commitments, including capital expenditures and the transition tax liability under the tcj act. in addition, these sources of cash fund other cash outflows including anticipated dividend payments and share repurchases. we do not have guarantees or off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe could have a material impact on our liquidity. see "item 1a. risk factors," "our business risks" and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
table of contents our sources and uses of cash were not materially adversely impacted by the russia-ukraine conflict and, to date, we have not identified any material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the conflict. based on the information currently available to us, we do not expect the impact of the russia-ukraine conflict to have a material impact on our future liquidity. we will continue to monitor and assess the impact the russia-ukraine conflict may have on our business and financial results. see "item 1a. risk factors," "our business risks" and note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to the impact of the russia-ukraine conflict on our business and financial results.
as of december 30, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material.
the tcj act imposed a one-time mandatory transition tax on undistributed international earnings. as of december 30, 2023, our mandatory transition tax liability was $2.3 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the tcj act; we currently expect to pay approximately $579 million of this liability in 2024. any additional guidance issued by the irs may impact our recorded amounts for this transition tax liability. see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the tcj act.
supply chain financing arrangements did not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources in the periods presented and we do not expect such arrangements to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources for the foreseeable future. see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of supply chain financing arrangements.
furthermore, our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality. working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns and generally lowest in the first quarter. on a continuing basis, we consider various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, dividends, share repurchases, productivity and other efficiency initiatives and other structural changes. these transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.
net cash provided by operating activities       $13,442                   $10,811
operating activities in 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $13.4 billion, compared to $10.8 billion in the prior year. the increase in operating cash flow primarily reflects favorable operating profit performance coupled with favorable working capital comparisons.
investing activities in 2023, net cash used for investing activities was $5.5 billion, primarily reflecting net capital spending of $5.3 billion.
in 2022, net cash used for investing activities was $2.4 billion, primarily reflecting net capital spending of $5.0 billion and our investment in celsius holdings, inc. (celsius) convertible preferred stock and agreement to distribute celsius energy drinks of $0.8 billion, partially offset by proceeds associated with the juice transaction of $3.5 billion.
see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of capital spending by division; see notes 4 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our agreement with table of contents and investment in celsius; and see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our acquisitions and divestitures.
we regularly review our plans with respect to net capital spending, including in light of the ongoing uncertainty caused by the russia-ukraine conflict on our business, and believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our net capital spending needs.
financing activities in 2023, net cash used for financing activities was $3.0 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments of $6.7 billion and share repurchases of $1.0 billion, as well as payments of long-term debt borrowings of $3.0 billion, partially offset by proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $5.5 billion and net proceeds from short-term borrowings of $2.3 billion.
in 2022, net cash used for financing activities was $8.5 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments of $6.2 billion and share repurchases of $1.5 billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of $2.5 billion and debt redemptions/cash tender offers of $1.7 billion, partially offset by proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $3.4 billion.
see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of debt obligations.
we annually review our capital structure with our board, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. on february 10, 2022, we announced a share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of pepsico common stock which commenced on february 11, 2022 and will expire on february 28, 2026. in addition, on february 9, 2024, we announced a 7% increase in our annualized dividend to $5.42 per share from $5.06 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in june 2024. we expect to return a total of approximately $8.2 billion to shareholders in 2024, comprising dividends of approximately $7.2 billion and share repurchases of approximately $1.0 billion.

we use free cash flow primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. we expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders primarily through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. however, see "item 1a. risk factors" and "our business risks" for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows.
any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. in addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of table of contents debt financing. see "item 1a. risk factors," "our business risks" and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.

our critical accounting policies and estimates an appreciation of our critical accounting policies and estimates is necessary to understand our financial results. these policies may require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties, including the business and economic uncertainty resulting from the ongoing conflicts in ukraine and the middle east and the high interest rate and inflationary cost environment, and as a result, such estimates may significantly impact our financial results. the precision of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. we applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented. we have discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee.
•revenue recognition;
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. the transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that generally do not allow for a right of return, except in the instance of a product recall or other limited circumstances that may allow for product returns. our policy for dsd, including certain chilled products, is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and table of contents freshness they expect. similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. as a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for product recall, anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.
our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the united states, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment.
we estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and forward-looking information (including the expected impact of a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment), leveraging estimates of creditworthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers.
our policy is to provide customers with product when needed. in fact, our commitment to freshness and product dating serves to regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered. in addition, dsd products are placed on the shelf by our employees with customer shelf space and storerooms limiting the quantity of product. for product delivered through other distribution networks, we monitor customer inventory levels.
as discussed in "our customers" in "item 1. business," we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.
a number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year-end once reconciled and settled. these accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. in addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred.
see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition and related policies, including total marketplace spending.
goodwill and other intangible assets we sell products under a number of brand names, many of which were developed by us. brand development costs are expensed as incurred. we also purchase brands and other intangible assets in acquisitions. in a business combination, the consideration is first assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities, including brands and other intangible assets, based on estimated fair values, with any excess recorded as goodwill. determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions, including those related to the ongoing conflicts in ukraine and the middle east and a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment, based on an evaluation of a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, product life cycles, market share, consumer awareness, brand history and future expansion expectations, amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.
we believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow table of contents performance and we have the intent and ability to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. if these indefinite-lived brand criteria are not met, brands are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from 20 to 40 years. determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including market share, consumer awareness, brand history, future expansion expectations and regulatory restrictions, as well as the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold.
in connection with previous acquisitions, we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided the exclusive and perpetual rights to manufacture and/or distribute beverages for sale in specified territories. in determining the useful life of these franchise rights, many factors were considered, including the pre-existing perpetual bottling arrangements, the indefinite period expected for these franchise rights to contribute to our future cash flows, as well as the lack of any factors that would limit the useful life of these franchise rights to us, including legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors. therefore, certain of these franchise rights are considered as indefinite-lived. franchise rights that are not considered indefinite-lived are amortized over the remaining contractual period of the contract in which the right was granted.
indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually, using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. we perform this annual assessment during our third quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. factors considered include macroeconomic conditions (including those related to the ongoing conflicts in ukraine and the middle east and a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment), industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.
in the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit, respectively. estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management's strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including those related to the ongoing conflicts in ukraine and the middle east and a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. all assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. a deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our results. these assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks described in "item 1a. risk factors" and "our business risks."
in 2023, we recorded $0.6 billion ($0.4 billion after-tax or $0.32 per share) of indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges related to the sodastream brand and $0.3 billion ($0.3 billion after-tax or $0.22 per share) of goodwill impairment charges related to the sodastream reporting unit in europe. as a result, the carrying value of the sodastream reporting unit as of december 30, 2023 is equal to its fair value and the sodastream reporting unit is at a heightened risk of future goodwill impairment if certain assumptions and estimates were to change. for example, a mutually exclusive 100-basis-point increase in the discount rate and a 100-basis-point decrease in the perpetuity growth rate used to estimate the fair value of the table of contents sodastream reporting unit would result in an additional estimated impairment charge of approximately $0.2 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively. we will continue to monitor the performance of the sodastream reporting unit, as well as all of our indefinite-lived intangible assets.
amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. if an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.
see notes 2 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
income tax expense and accruals our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. we establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. we adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit, new tax laws, relevant court cases or tax authority settlements. see "item 1a. risk factors" for further discussion.
an estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to our quarterly operating results. in the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item. we consider the tax adjustments from the resolution of prior-year tax matters to be among such items.
tax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. as a result, our annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns (our cash tax rate). some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit on our consolidated financial statements. we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our consolidated financial statements.
in 2023, our annual tax rate was 19.8% compared to 16.1% in 2022. see "other consolidated results" for further information.
see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
pension and retiree medical plans our pension plans cover certain employees in the united states and certain international employees. benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings. certain u.s. and canada retirees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements. generally, our share of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts, which vary based upon years of service, with retirees contributing the remainder of the cost. in addition, we have been phasing out certain subsidies of retiree medical benefits.
table of contents see "items affecting comparability" and note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about changes and settlements within our pension plans.
our assumptions the determination of pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of benefits that employees earn while working, as well as the present value of those benefits. annual pension and retiree medical expense amounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year (service cost), (2) the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time (interest cost), and (3) other gains and losses as discussed in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, reduced by (4) the expected return on assets for our funded plans.
•certain employee-related demographic factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality;
•the expected rate of return on assets in our funded plans; and
•the spot rates along the yield curve used to determine service and interest costs and the present value of liabilities.
certain assumptions reflect our historical experience and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. all actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, except in the case of an interim remeasurement due to a significant event such as a curtailment or settlement. due to the significant management judgment involved, these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations.
at each measurement date, the discount rates are based on interest rates for high-quality, long-term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to those of our liabilities. our u.s. obligation and pension and retiree medical expense is based on the discount rates determined using the mercer above mean curve. this curve includes bonds that closely match the timing and amount of our expected benefit payments and reflects the portfolio of investments we would consider to settle our liabilities.
see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about the expected rate of return on plan assets and our plans' investment strategy. although we review our expected long-term rates of return on an annual basis, our asset returns in a given year do not significantly influence our evaluation of long-term rates of return.
pension service cost discount rate (a)                       5.4   %            5.5   %            3.2   %
expected rate of return on plan assets (a)           7.0   %            7.0   %            6.3   %

expected rate of return on plan assets               7.1   %            7.1   %            5.7   %
(a)2022 rates reflect remeasurement of a u.s. qualified defined benefit pension plan in the second quarter of 2022.
we expect our pension and retiree medical expense to remain consistent in 2024 primarily reflecting the change in demographic experience, offset by the recognition of gains on plan assets and impact of discretionary plan contributions.
table of contents sensitivity of assumptions a decrease in each of the collective discount rates or in the expected rate of return assumptions would increase expense for our benefit plans. a 100-basis-point decrease in each of the above discount rates and expected rate of return assumptions would individually increase 2024 pre-tax pension and retiree medical expense as follows:
assumption                                                     amount discount rates used in the calculation of expense            $83
expected rate of return                                     $155
funding we make contributions to pension trusts that provide plan benefits for certain pension plans. these contributions are made in accordance with applicable tax regulations that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions and taxation to the employee only upon receipt of plan benefits. generally, we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be currently tax deductible. as our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulatory funding requirements, we generally fund these plans on a pay-as-you-go basis, although we periodically review available options to make additional contributions toward these benefits.
we made a discretionary contribution of $150 million to a u.s. qualified defined benefit plan in january 2024.
our pension and retiree medical plan contributions are subject to change as a result of many factors, such as changes in interest rates, deviations between actual and expected asset returns and changes in tax or other benefit laws. we regularly evaluate different opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for our past and expected contributions and estimated future benefit payments.

table of contents notes to the consolidated financial statements note 1 - basis of presentation and our divisions basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap and include the consolidated accounts of pepsico, inc. and the affiliates that we control. in addition, we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates using the equity method based on our economic ownership interest, our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources. we do not control these other affiliates, as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally 50% or less. intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. as a result of exchange restrictions and other operating restrictions, we do not have control over our venezuelan subsidiaries. as such, our venezuelan subsidiaries are not included within our consolidated financial results for any period presented.
raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. the costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. estimates are used in determining, among other items, sales incentives accruals, tax reserves, share-based compensation, pension and retiree medical accruals, amounts and useful lives for intangible assets and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets, goodwill and other long-lived assets. we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. additionally, the business and economic uncertainty resulting from the ongoing conflicts in ukraine and the middle east and the high interest rate and inflationary cost environment has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. as future events and their effect cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
our fiscal year ends on the last saturday of each december, resulting in a 53rd reporting week every five or six years, including in our 2022 financial results. while our north america financial results are reported on a weekly calendar basis, substantially all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis prior to the fourth quarter of 2021. beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis. this change did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. the following chart details our quarterly reporting schedule:

2)quaker foods north america (qfna), which includes our branded convenient food businesses, such as cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food, in the united states and canada;
3)pepsico beverages north america (pbna), which includes our beverage businesses in the united states and canada;
4)latin america (latam), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in latin america;
5)europe, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in europe;
6)africa, middle east and south asia (amesa), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in africa, the middle east and south asia; and
7)asia pacific, australia and new zealand and china region (apac), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in asia pacific, australia and new zealand, and china region.
through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with our largest operations in the united states, mexico, canada, russia, china, the united kingdom, brazil and south africa.
the accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described in note 2, except for the following allocation methodologies:
the allocation of share-based compensation expense of each division is as follows:
the expense allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which reflect market conditions over which division management has no control. therefore, any variances between allocated expense and our actual expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.
table of contents pension and retiree medical expense pension and retiree medical service costs measured at fixed discount rates are reflected in division results. the variance between the fixed discount rate used to determine the service cost reflected in division results and the discount rate as disclosed in note 7 is reflected in corporate unallocated expenses.
derivatives we centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. these commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. these gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. these derivatives hedge underlying commodity price risk and were not entered into for trading or speculative purposes.
net revenue and operating profit/(loss)
net revenue and operating profit/(loss) of each division are as follows:
net revenue                                                            operating profit/(loss)
(a)see below for impairment and other charges taken related to the russia-ukraine conflict, brand portfolio impairment and other impairment.
(b)in 2023, operating profit included a pre-tax charge of $136 million ($104 million after-tax or $0.07 per share) in cost of sales for product returns, inventory write-offs and customer and consumer-related costs associated with the quaker recall.
(c)in 2022, we recorded a gain of $3,029 million and $292 million in our pbna and europe divisions, respectively, associated with the juice transaction. the total after-tax amount was $2,888 million or $2.08 per share. see note 13 for further information.
table of contents disaggregation of net revenue our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products to our customers. the following table reflects the percentage of net revenue generated between our beverage business and our convenient food business for each of our international divisions, as well as our consolidated net revenue:
(a)beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which primarily includes our consolidated bottling operations in our pbna and europe divisions, is 35%, 37% and 40% of our consolidated net revenue in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. generally, our finished goods beverage operations produce higher net revenue, but lower operating margins as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of finished goods beverages.
impairment and other charges we recognized russia-ukraine conflict charges, brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges as described below.

note 2 - our significant accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. merchandising activities are performed after a customer obtains control of the product, are accounted for as fulfillment of our performance obligation to ship or deliver product to our customers and are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. merchandising activities are immaterial in the context of our contracts. in addition, we exclude from net revenue all sales, use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by government authorities on revenue producing transactions.
the transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that generally do not allow for a right of return, except in the instance of a product recall or other limited circumstances that may allow for product returns. our policy for dsd, including certain chilled products, is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. as a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for product recall, anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.
our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the united states, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment.
we estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and forward-looking information (including the expected impact of a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment), leveraging estimates of creditworthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers.
we are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers, including walmart. we have not experienced credit issues with these customers. in 2023, sales to walmart and its affiliates (including sam's) represented approximately 14% of our consolidated net revenue, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to walmart.
table of contents total marketplace spending we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.
a number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year-end once reconciled and settled. these accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. in addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred.
the terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed one year and, therefore, do not require highly uncertain long-term estimates. certain arrangements, such as fountain pouring rights, may extend beyond one year. upfront payments to customers under these arrangements are recognized over the shorter of the economic or contractual life, primarily as a reduction of revenue, and the remaining balances of $228 million as of december 30, 2023 and $242 million as of december 31, 2022 are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our balance sheet.
for interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. the allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period's actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. in addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. our annual consolidated financial statements are not impacted by this interim allocation methodology.
advertising and other marketing activities, reported as selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled $5.7 billion in 2023, $5.2 billion in 2022 and $5.1 billion in 2021, including advertising expenses of $3.8 billion in 2023 and $3.5 billion in both 2022 and 2021. deferred advertising costs are not expensed until the year first used and consist of:
•media and personal service prepayments;
•production costs of future media advertising.
deferred advertising costs of $67 million and $40 million as of december 30, 2023 and december 31, 2022, respectively, are classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet.
distribution costs distribution costs, including the costs of shipping and handling activities, which include certain merchandising activities, are reported as selling, general and administrative expenses. shipping and handling expenses were $15.4 billion in 2023, $15.0 billion in 2022 and $13.7 billion in 2021.
table of contents software costs we capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended. capitalized software costs include (1) external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining computer software, (2) compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software projects and (3) interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software. capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives of the software, which approximate five to 10 years. software amortization totaled $159 million in 2023, $123 million in 2022 and $135 million in 2021. net capitalized software and development costs were $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion as of december 30, 2023 and december 31, 2022, respectively.
commitments and contingencies we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, certain taxes and environmental matters, as well as commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations. we recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable and estimable.
research and development we engage in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth and to drive innovation globally. consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs. research and development costs were $804 million, $771 million and $752 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are reported within selling, general and administrative expenses.
goodwill and other intangible assets indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually, using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. we perform this annual assessment during our third quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. factors considered include macroeconomic conditions (including those related to the ongoing conflicts in ukraine and the middle east and a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment), industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.
in the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit, respectively. estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management's strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including those related to the ongoing conflicts in ukraine and the middle east and a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. all assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent table of contents with our internal forecasts and operating plans. a deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our results.
amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. if an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.

note 3 - restructuring and impairment charges
2019 multi-year productivity plan we publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on february 15, 2019 that will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. to build on the successful implementation of the 2019 productivity plan, in 2022, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above. as a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.65 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $2.9 billion. these pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 55% of severance and other employee-related costs, 10% for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions and 35% for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives.
table of contents the total plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows:

table of contents amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over an intangible asset's estimated useful life. amortization of intangible assets for each of the next five years, based on existing intangible assets as of december 30, 2023 and using average 2023 foreign exchange rates, is expected to be as follows:
depreciable and amortizable assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. in these circumstances, if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on discounted future cash flows. useful lives are periodically evaluated to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision.
indefinite-lived intangible assets as discussed in note 2, we perform our annual impairment assessment on indefinite-lived intangible assets during our third quarter. the annual impairment assessment on indefinite-lived intangible assets performed in the third quarter of 2023, based on best available market information and our internal forecasts and operating plans at the time, did not result in any material impairment charges.
in the fourth quarter of 2023, macroeconomic conditions, including higher interest rates, inflationary costs, and the ongoing conflict in the middle east, and recent business performance indicated a deterioration of the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in various markets, primarily assumptions underlying the weighted-average cost of capital and the impact of economic uncertainty on current and future financial performance, and required us to perform a quantitative assessment on certain assets. the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets was estimated using discounted cash flows under the income approach, which we consider to be a level 3 measurement. we determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value, which reflects the increase in the weighted-average cost of capital as well as our most current estimates of future sales and their contributions to operating profit and expected future cash flows (including perpetuity growth assumptions). as a result of the quantitative assessment, we recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $0.6 billion ($0.5 billion after-tax or $0.35 per share) for brands and $0.3 billion ($0.3 billion after-tax or $0.22 per share) for goodwill, both in impairment of intangible assets, primarily related to the sodastream brand and reporting unit in our europe division, in the year ended december 30, 2023. see note 1 for further information.
in the first quarter of 2022, we discontinued or repositioned certain juice and dairy brands in russia in our europe division. as a result, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges (included in brand portfolio impairment charges) of $241 million ($193 million after-tax or $0.14 per share) in impairment of intangible assets, primarily related to indefinite-lived intangible assets in the year ended december 31, 2022. see note 1 for further information.
in the second quarter of 2022, macroeconomic factors, sanctions and other regulations as a result of the russia-ukraine conflict indicated a material deterioration of the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in russia, primarily assumptions underlying the weighted-average cost of capital. these factors required us to perform a quantitative assessment, despite the absence of a material adverse impact on these assets' financial performance (e.g., sales, operating profit, cash flows). the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in russia was estimated using discounted cash flows under the income approach, which we consider to be a level 3 measurement. we determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value, with the decrease in the fair value primarily attributable to a significant increase in the weighted-average cost of capital, which reflected the macroeconomic uncertainty in russia. as a result of the quantitative assessment, we recorded pre-tax table of contents impairment charges of $1.2 billion ($958 million after-tax or $0.69 per share) in impairment of intangible assets, related to our juice and dairy brands in russia in our europe division, in the year ended december 31, 2022. see note 1 for further information.
in the fourth quarter of 2022, macroeconomic conditions including a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment, coupled with recent business performance, indicated a deterioration of the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in various markets, primarily assumptions underlying the weighted-average cost of capital and the impact of economic uncertainty on current and future financial performance, and required us to perform a quantitative assessment on certain assets. the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets was estimated using discounted cash flows under the income approach, which we consider to be a level 3 measurement. we determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value, which reflected the increase in the weighted-average cost of capital as well as our most current estimates of future sales and their contributions to operating profit and expected future cash flows (including perpetuity growth assumptions). as a result of the quantitative assessment, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges of $1.6 billion ($1.3 billion after-tax or $0.94 per share) in impairment of intangible assets, primarily related to the sodastream brand in our europe division, in the year ended december 31, 2022. see note 1 for further information.
we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in each of the years ended december 31, 2022 and december 25, 2021. we did not recognize any impairment charges for indefinite-lived intangible assets in the year ended december 25, 2021.
as of december 30, 2023, the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived reacquired and acquired franchise rights recorded at pbna exceeded their carrying values. however, there could be an impairment of the carrying value of pbna's reacquired and acquired franchise rights, as well as further impairment to the carrying value of the sodastream reporting unit goodwill, if future sales and their contributions to operating profit do not achieve our expected future cash flows (including perpetuity growth assumptions) or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value.

(c)impairment in 2022 is related to the sale of certain non-strategic brands. see note 1 for further information.
(d)translation and other in 2023 primarily reflects the depreciation of the russian ruble, partially offset by appreciation of the euro and british pound.
(e)impairment in 2022 is related to the sodastream brand, the decrease in fair value as a result of the russia-ukraine conflict and the discontinuation or repositioning of certain juice and dairy brands in russia. impairments in 2023 are related to sodastream goodwill and brand.
(f)impairment is related to brands from the pioneer foods acquisition.
(g)impairment in 2022 and 2023 is related to the be & cheery brand.
note 5 - income taxes the components of income before income taxes are as follows:
the provision for income taxes consisted of the following:
a reconciliation of the u.s. federal statutory tax rate to our annual tax rate is as follows:

tax cuts and jobs act in 2022, we recorded $86 million ($0.06 per share) of net tax expense related to the tcj act as a result of correlating adjustments related to a partial audit settlement with the irs for tax years 2014 through 2019. in 2021, we recorded $190 million ($0.14 per share) of net tax expense related to the tcj act as a result of adjustments related to the final assessment of the 2014 through 2016 irs audit.
as of december 30, 2023, our mandatory transition tax liability was $2.3 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the tcj act. we reduced our liability through cash payments and application of tax overpayments by $309 million in each of 2023, 2022 and 2021. we currently expect to pay approximately $579 million of this liability in 2024.
table of contents the tcj act also created a requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, known as global intangible low-tax income (gilti), must be included in the gross income of their u.s. shareholder. the fasb allows an accounting policy election of either recognizing deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as gilti in future years or recognizing such taxes as a current-period expense when incurred. we elected to treat the tax effect of gilti as a current-period expense when incurred.
other tax matters in 2021, we received a final assessment from the irs audit for the tax years 2014 through 2016. the assessment included both agreed and unagreed issues. on october 29, 2021, we filed a formal written protest of the assessment and requested an appeals conference. as a result of the analysis of the 2014 through 2016 final assessment, we remeasured all applicable reserves for uncertain tax positions for all years open under the statute of limitations, including any correlating adjustments impacting the mandatory transition tax liability under the tcj act, resulting in a net non-cash tax expense of $112 million ($0.08 per share) in 2021.
in 2022, we came to an agreement with the irs to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. the agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019. as a result, we reduced our reserves for uncertain tax positions, including any correlating adjustments impacting the mandatory transition tax liability under the tcj act, resulting in a net non-cash tax benefit of $233 million ($0.17 per share) in 2022. tax years 2014 through 2019 remain under audit for other issues.

as of december 30, 2023, the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes, reported in other liabilities, was $2.1 billion. we accrue interest related to reserves for income taxes in our provision for income taxes and any associated penalties are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. the gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $390 million as of december 30, 2023, of which $102 million of tax expense was recognized in 2023. the gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $292 million as of december 31, 2022, of which $4 million of tax benefit was recognized in 2022.

carryforwards and allowances operating loss carryforwards and income tax credits totaling $34.7 billion as of december 30, 2023 are being carried forward in a number of foreign and state jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses and income tax credits from prior periods to reduce future taxable income or income tax liabilities. these operating losses and income tax credits will expire as follows: $0.4 billion in 2024, $29.8
table of contents billion between 2025 and 2041 and $4.5 billion may be carried forward indefinitely. we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.
undistributed international earnings as of december 30, 2023, we had approximately $7 billion of undistributed international earnings. we intend to continue to reinvest $7 billion of earnings outside the united states for the foreseeable future and while future distribution of these earnings would not be subject to u.s. federal tax expense, no deferred tax liabilities with respect to items such as certain foreign exchange gains or losses, foreign withholding taxes or state taxes have been recognized. it is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these reinvested international earnings.
note 6 - share-based compensation our share-based compensation program is designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees' interests with the interests of our shareholders. pepsico has granted stock options, rsus, psus and long-term cash awards to employees under the shareholder-approved pepsico, inc. long-term incentive plan (ltip). executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance may generally elect to receive their grant in the form of stock options or rsus, or a combination thereof. executives who elect stock options receive four stock options for every one rsu that would have otherwise been granted. certain executive officers and other senior executives do not have a choice and are granted 66% psus and 34% long-term cash, each of which are subject to pre-established performance targets.
the company may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of rsus and psus.
as of december 30, 2023, 28 million shares were available for future share-based compensation grants under the ltip.
the following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense, which is primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, and excess tax benefits recognized:
income tax benefits recognized in earnings related to share-based compensation             $73                   $62                   $57
excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation                                    $36                   $44                   $38
as of december 30, 2023, there was $441 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation grants. this unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two years.
method of accounting and our assumptions the fair value of share-based award grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period, primarily three years. awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no table of contents longer required to provide service to earn the award. in addition, we use historical data to estimate forfeiture rates and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.
we do not backdate, reprice or grant share-based compensation awards retroactively. repricing of awards would require shareholder approval under the ltip.
stock options a stock option permits the holder to purchase shares of pepsico common stock at a specified price. we account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a black-scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense at the date of grant. all stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and generally have a 10-year term.
expected life                      7 years                 7 years                 7 years risk-free interest rate           4.2    %                1.9    %                1.1    %
expected volatility                16    %                 16    %                 14    %
the expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected to hold their options. it is based on our historical experience with similar grants. the risk-free interest rate is based on the expected u.s. treasury rate over the expected life. volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life. dividend yield is estimated over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net income, share repurchases and stock price.
a summary of our stock option activity for the year ended december 30, 2023 is as follows:

table of contents restricted stock units and performance stock units each rsu represents our obligation to deliver to the holder one share of pepsico common stock when the award vests at the end of the service period. psus are awards pursuant to which a number of shares are delivered to the holder upon vesting at the end of the service period based on pepsico's performance against specified financial performance metrics. the number of shares may be increased to the maximum or reduced to the minimum threshold based on the results of these performance metrics in accordance with the terms established at the time of the award. during the vesting period, rsus and psus accrue dividend equivalents that pay out in cash (without interest) if and when the applicable rsu or psu vests and becomes payable.
the fair value of rsus and psus are measured at the market price of the company's stock on the date of grant.

table of contents note 7 - pension, retiree medical and savings plans effective december 31, 2022, we merged two u.s. qualified defined benefit pension plans, pepsico employees retirement plan i (plan i), mostly inactive participants, and pepsico employees retirement plan a (plan a), mostly active participants, with plan i remaining. the accrued benefits offered to the plans' participants were unchanged. the merger was made to provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. actuarial gains and losses of the merged plan will be amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of participants. there was no material impact to pre-tax pension benefits expense from this merger.
in 2022, we transferred pension and retiree medical obligations of $145 million and related assets to tbg in connection with the juice transaction. see note 13 for further information.
in 2021, we adopted a change to the canadian defined benefit plans to freeze pension accruals for salaried participants, effective january 1, 2024, and to close the hourly plan to new non-union employees hired on or after january 1, 2022. after the effective date, all salaried participants receive an employer contribution to the defined contribution plan based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution and the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee contributions up to defined limits. we also adopted a change to the u.k. defined benefit plan to freeze pension accruals for all participants effective march 31, 2022. after the effective date, participants have the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee contributions up to defined limits. pre-tax pension benefits expense will decrease after the effective dates, partially offset by contributions to defined contribution plans.
in 2021, we adopted a change to the u.s. qualified defined benefit plans to transfer certain participants from plan a to plan i, effective january 1, 2022. the accrued benefits offered to the plans' participants were unchanged. there was no material impact to pre-tax pension benefits expense from this transaction.
in 2020, we adopted an amendment to the u.s. qualified defined benefit plans to freeze benefit accruals for salaried participants, effective december 31, 2025.
gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions, including the difference between the actual and expected return on plan assets, as well as changes in our assumptions, are determined at each measurement date. these differences are recognized as a component of net gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders' equity. if this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan obligations, a portion of the net gain or loss is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits income for the following year based upon the average remaining service life for participants in pepsico employees retirement hourly plan (plan h) (approximately 11 years) and retiree medical (approximately 10 years), and the remaining life expectancy for participants in plan i (approximately 26 years).
the cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost/(credit)) is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits income on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service life for participants in plan h, and the remaining life expectancy for participants in plan i, except that prior service cost/(credit) for salaried participants subject to the benefit accruals freeze effective december 31, 2025 is amortized on a straight-line basis over the period up to the effective date of the freeze.

table of contents the amount we report in operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost is service cost, which is the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year.
the amounts we report below operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost consist of the following components:
•interest cost is the accrued interest on the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time.
•expected return on plan assets is the long-term return we expect to earn on plan investments for our funded plans that will be used to settle future benefit obligations.
•amortization of prior service cost/(credit) represents the recognition in the income statement of benefit changes resulting from plan amendments.
•amortization of net loss/(gain) represents the recognition in the income statement of changes in the amount of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation based on changes in assumptions and actual experience.
•settlement/curtailment loss/(gain) represents the result of actions that effectively eliminate all or a portion of related projected benefit obligations. settlements are triggered when payouts to settle the projected benefit obligation of a plan due to lump sums or other events exceed the total of annual service and interest cost. settlements are recognized when actions are irrevocable and we are relieved of the primary responsibility and risk for projected benefit obligations. lump sum payouts are generally higher when interest rates are lower. curtailments are recognized when events such as plant closures, the sale of a business, or plan changes result in a significant reduction of future service or benefits. curtailment losses are recognized when an event is probable and estimable, while curtailment gains are recognized when an event has occurred (when the related employees terminate or an amendment is adopted).
•special termination benefits are the additional benefits offered to employees upon departure due to actions such as restructuring.
the components of total pension and retiree medical benefit costs are as follows:

of the total projected pension benefit obligation as of december 30, 2023, approximately $678 million relates to plans that we do not fund because the funding of such plans does not receive favorable tax treatment.
future benefit payments our estimated future benefit payments are as follows:
(a)expected future benefit payments for our retiree medical plans do not reflect any estimated subsidies expected to be received under the 2003 medicare act. subsidies are expected to be approximately $1 million for each of the years from 2024 through 2028 and approximately $2 million in total for 2029 through 2033.
these future benefit payments to beneficiaries include payments from both funded and unfunded plans.
table of contents funding contributions to our pension and retiree medical plans were as follows:
(a)includes $250 million contribution in 2023, $150 million contribution in 2022 and $500 million contribution in 2021 to fund our u.s. qualified defined benefit plans.
we made a discretionary contribution of $150 million to a u.s. qualified defined benefit plan in january 2024. in addition, in 2024, we expect to make non-discretionary contributions of approximately $99 million to our u.s. and international pension benefit plans and contributions of approximately $51 million for retiree medical benefits.
we also regularly evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans.
plan assets our pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed accounts and is reviewed periodically in conjunction with plan obligations, an evaluation of market conditions, tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments. this strategy is also applicable to funds held for the retiree medical plans. our investment objective includes ensuring that funds are available to meet the plans' benefit obligations when they become due. assets contributed to our pension plans are no longer controlled by us, but become the property of our individual pension plans. however, we are indirectly impacted by changes in these plan assets as compared to changes in our projected obligations. our overall investment policy is to prudently invest plan assets in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities and real estate to achieve our long-term return expectations. our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments, such as futures and forward contracts, to reduce interest rate and foreign currency risks. futures contracts represent commitments to purchase or sell securities at a future date and at a specified price. forward contracts consist of currency forwards.
for 2024 and 2023, our expected long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets is 7.4%. our target investment allocations for u.s. plan assets are as follows:
actual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions. we regularly review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments.
the expected return on plan assets is based on our investment strategy and our expectations for long-term rates of return by asset class, taking into account volatility and correlation among asset classes and our historical experience. we also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term rates. we evaluate our expected return assumptions annually to ensure that they are reasonable. to calculate the expected return on plan assets, our market-related value of assets for fixed income is the actual fair value. for all other asset categories, such as equity securities, we use a table of contents method that recognizes investment gains or losses (the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets) over a five-year period. this has the effect of reducing year-to-year volatility.
plan assets measured at fair value as of year-end 2023 and 2022 are categorized consistently by level 1 (quoted prices in active markets for identical assets), level 2 (significant other observable inputs) and level 3 (significant unobservable inputs) in both years and are as follows:
dividends and interest receivable, net of payables                                                                    87                     120
(a)includes $183 million and $196 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, of retiree medical plan assets that are restricted for purposes of providing health benefits for u.s. retirees and their beneficiaries.
(b)invested in u.s. and international common stock and commingled funds, and the preferred stock portfolio was invested in domestic and international corporate preferred stock investments. the common and preferred stock investments are based on quoted prices in active markets. the commingled funds are based on the published price of the fund and include one large-cap fund that represents 13% and 10% of total u.s. plan assets for 2023 and 2022, respectively.
(c)these investments are based on quoted bid prices for comparable securities in the marketplace and broker/dealer quotes in active markets. corporate bonds of u.s.-based companies represents 31% and 32% of total u.s. plan assets for 2023 and 2022, respectively.
(d)based on the fair value of the contracts as determined by the insurance companies using inputs that are not observable. the changes in level 3 amounts were not significant in the years ended december 30, 2023 and december 31, 2022.
(e)includes level 1 assets of $3 million for 2023 and level 2 assets of $346 million and $157 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively.
(f)the real estate commingled funds include investments in limited partnerships. these funds are based on the net asset value of the appraised value of investments owned by these funds as determined by independent third parties using inputs that are not observable. the majority of the funds are redeemable quarterly subject to availability of cash and have notice periods ranging from 45 to 90 days.
(g)based on the published price of the fund.

year of ultimate projected increase            2046               2046
annually, we review external data and our historical experience to estimate assumed health care cost trend rates that impact our retiree medical plan obligation and expense, however the cap on our share of retiree medical costs limits the impact.
savings plan certain u.s. employees are eligible to participate in a 401(k) savings plan, which is a voluntary defined contribution plan. the plan is designed to help employees accumulate savings for retirement and we make company matching contributions for certain employees on a portion of employee contributions based on years of service.
certain u.s. employees, who are either not eligible to participate in a defined benefit pension plan or whose benefit is capped, are also eligible to receive an employer contribution based on either years of service or age and years of service regardless of employee contribution.

table of contents as of december 30, 2023 and december 31, 2022, our international debt of $279 million and $304 million, respectively, was related to borrowings from external parties, including various lines of credit. these lines of credit are subject to normal banking terms and conditions and are fully committed at least to the extent of our borrowings.
the net proceeds from the issuances of the above notes will be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper.
in 2023, we entered into a new five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (five-year credit agreement), which expires on may 26, 2028. the five-year credit agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $4.2 billion in u.s. dollars and/or euros, including a $0.75 billion swing line subfacility for euro-denominated borrowings permitted to be borrowed on a same-day basis, subject to customary terms and conditions. we may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $4.95 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). additionally, we may, once a year, request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period. the five-year credit agreement replaced our $3.8 billion five-year credit agreement, dated as of may 27, 2022.
also in 2023, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-day credit agreement), which expires on may 24, 2024. the 364-day credit agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $4.2 billion in u.s. dollars and/or euros, subject to customary terms and conditions. we may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $4.95 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). we may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which term loan would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. the 364-day credit agreement replaced our $3.8 billion 364-day credit agreement, dated as of may 27, 2022.
funds borrowed under the five-year credit agreement and the 364-day credit agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. subject to certain conditions, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. as of december 30, 2023, there were no outstanding borrowings under the five-year credit agreement or the 364-day credit agreement.
in 2023, we discharged via legal defeasance $94 million outstanding principal amount of certain notes originally issued by our subsidiary, the quaker oats company, following the deposit of $102 million of u.s. government securities with the bank of new york mellon, as trustee, in the fourth quarter of 2022.
in 2022, we paid $750 million to redeem all $750 million outstanding principal amount of our 2.25% senior notes due may 2022, we paid $800 million to redeem all $800 million outstanding principal amount of our 3.10% senior notes due july 2022 and we paid $154 million to redeem all $133 million outstanding table of contents principal amount of our subsidiary, pepsi-cola metropolitan bottling company, inc.'s 7.00% senior notes due march 2029 and 5.50% notes due may 2035.
in 2021, we completed cash tender offers to redeem $4.1 billion principal amount of certain notes, with maturity dates ranging from may 2035 to march 2060 and interest rates ranging from 3.375% to 5.500%, for $4.8 billion in cash. as a result of the cash tender offers, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $842 million ($677 million after-tax or $0.49 per share) to net interest expense and other, primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes and loss on treasury rate locks used to mitigate the interest rate risk on the cash tender offers.
also in 2021, we paid $750 million to redeem all $750 million outstanding principal amount of our 1.70% senior notes due 2021 and terminated the associated interest rate swap with a notional amount of $250 million.
note 9 - financial instruments derivatives and hedging we are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:
•commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy;
•foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and in the normal course of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements.
our hedging strategies include the use of derivatives and, in the case of our net investment hedges, debt instruments. certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings. the accounting for qualifying hedges allows changes in a hedging instrument's fair value to offset corresponding changes in the hedged item in the same reporting period that the hedged item impacts earnings. gains or losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders' equity and reclassified to our income statement when the hedged transaction affects earnings. if it becomes probable that the hedged transaction will not occur, we immediately recognize the related hedging gains or losses in earnings; there were no such gains or losses reclassified during the year ended december 30, 2023.
cash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity price, foreign exchange or interest rate risks are classified as operating activities in the cash flow statement. we classify both the earnings and cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the underlying hedged item.
credit risk we perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk regularly, including reviewing netting agreements, if any, and a review of credit ratings, credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counterparty. based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk, we consider this risk to be low. in addition, we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk.
table of contents certain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position if our credit rating is at a2 (moody's investors service, inc.) or a (s&p global ratings) and we have been placed on credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below either of these levels. the fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of december 30, 2023 was $144 million. we have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of december 30, 2023.
commodity prices we are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in the competitive environment in which we operate. this risk is managed through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, which primarily include swaps and futures. in addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. we use derivatives, with terms of no more than three years, to hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases, primarily for agricultural products, energy and metals. derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. these gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.
our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $1.7 billion as of december 30, 2023 and $1.8 billion as of december 31, 2022.
foreign exchange we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases and foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. we manage this risk through sourcing purchases from local suppliers, negotiating contracts in local currencies with foreign suppliers and through the use of derivatives, primarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two years. exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses on our income statement as incurred. we also use net investment hedges to partially offset the effects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.
our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $3.8 billion as of december 30, 2023 and $3.0 billion as of december 31, 2022. the total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $3.0 billion as of december 30, 2023 and $2.9 billion as of december 31, 2022. for foreign currency derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, gains and losses were offset by changes in the underlying hedged items, resulting in no material net impact on earnings.
interest rates we centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies. we use various interest rate derivative instruments including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, treasury locks and swap locks to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk. these instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances. the notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of our cross-currency interest rate swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt. our cross-currency interest rate swaps have terms of no more than table of contents twelve years. our treasury locks and swap locks are entered into to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions.
our interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $1.3 billion as of december 30, 2023 and december 31, 2022.
as of december 30, 2023, approximately 9% of total debt was subject to variable rates, compared to approximately 1%, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, as of december 31, 2022.
debt securities held-to-maturity investments in debt securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity. highly liquid debt securities with original maturities of three months or less are recorded as cash equivalents. our held-to-maturity debt securities consist of commercial paper. as of december 30, 2023, we had $309 million of investments in commercial paper recorded in cash and cash equivalents. as of december 31, 2022, we had no investments in held-to-maturity debt securities. held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. as of december 30, 2023, gross unrecognized gains and losses and the allowance for expected credit losses were not material.
available-for-sale investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value. changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities are generally recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders' equity. changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities impact earnings only when such securities are sold, or an allowance for expected credit losses or impairment is recognized. we regularly evaluate our investment portfolio for expected credit losses and impairment. in making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the extent to which the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost; the financial condition of the issuer, including the credit quality, and any changes thereto; and our intent to sell, or whether we will more likely than not be required to sell, the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. our assessment of whether a debt security has a credit loss or is impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular debt security.
in 2022, we entered into an agreement with celsius to distribute celsius energy drinks in the united states (see note 4 for further information) and invested $550 million in series a convertible preferred shares issued by celsius, which included certain conversion and redemption features. the preferred shares automatically convert into celsius common shares after six years if certain market-based conditions are met, or can be redeemed after seven years. shares underlying the transaction were priced at $75 per share, and the preferred shares are entitled to a 5% annual dividend, payable either in cash or in-kind. given our redemption right, we classified our investment in the convertible preferred stock as an available-for-sale debt security. as of december 31, 2022, the fair value of this investment was classified as level 2, based primarily on the transaction price. there were no unrealized gains and losses on our investment in the year ended december 31, 2022. in the year ended december 30, 2023, we transferred $558 million from level 2 to level 3 as unobservable inputs to the fair value became more significant and subsequently recorded an unrealized gain of $612 million in other comprehensive income and a decrease in the investment of $14 million due to cash dividends received. there were no impairment charges related to our investment in the years ended december 30, 2023 and december 31, 2022.
table of contents tbg investment in the first quarter of 2022, we sold our tropicana, naked and other select juice brands to pai partners, while retaining a 39% noncontrolling interest in tbg, operating across north america and europe. we have significant influence over our investment in tbg and account for our investment under the equity method, recognizing our proportionate share of tbg's earnings on our income statement (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses). see note 13 for further information.
in 2023, we recorded our proportionate share of tbg's earnings, which includes an impairment of tbg's indefinite-lived intangible assets, and recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of our investment, both of which resulted in pre-tax impairment charges of $321 million ($243 million after-tax or $0.18 per share), recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in our pbna division. we estimated the fair value of our ownership in tbg using discounted cash flows and an option pricing model related to our liquidation preference in tbg, which we categorized as level 3 (significant unobservable inputs) in the fair value hierarchy.

(a)fair value hierarchy levels are defined in note 7. unless otherwise noted, financial assets are classified on our balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. financial liabilities are classified on our balance sheet within accounts payable and other current liabilities and other liabilities.
(b)includes level 2 assets of $178 million and level 3 assets of $1,156 million as of december 30, 2023, and level 2 assets of $660 million as of december 31, 2022. as of december 30, 2023, $1,334 million was classified as other assets. as of december 31, 2022, $3 million, $104 million and $553 million were classified as cash equivalents, short-term investments and other assets, respectively. the fair values of these level 2 investments approximate the transaction price and any accrued dividends, as well as the amortized cost. the fair value of our level 3 investment in celsius is estimated using probability-weighted discounted future cash flows based on a monte carlo simulation using significant unobservable inputs such as an 80% probability that a certain market-based condition will be met and an average estimated discount rate of 8.1% based on celsius' estimated synthetic credit rating. an increase in the probability that certain market-based conditions will be met or a decrease in the discount rate would result in a higher fair value measurement, while a decrease in the probability that certain market-based conditions will be met or an increase in the discount rate would result in a lower fair value measurement.
(c)based on the price of index funds. these investments are classified as short-term investments and are used to manage a portion of market risk arising from our deferred compensation liability.
(d)based primarily on the price of our common stock.
(e)based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees' investment elections.
(f)based on recently reported market transactions of spot and forward rates.
(g)primarily based on recently reported market transactions of swap arrangements.
(h)derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis on our balance sheet. amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements which are not offset on our balance sheet as of december 30, 2023 and december 31, 2022 were not material. collateral received or posted against our asset or liability positions was not material. exchange-traded commodity futures are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, not included in the table.
the carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments recorded at amortized cost approximate fair value (classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) due to their short-term maturity. the fair value of our debt obligations as of december 30, 2023 and december 31, 2022 was $41 billion and $35 billion, respectively, based upon prices of identical or similar instruments in the marketplace, which are considered level 2 inputs.

note 12 - leases lessee we determine whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. we have operating leases for plants, warehouses, distribution centers, storage facilities, offices and other facilities, as well as machinery and equipment, including fleet. our leases generally have remaining lease terms of up to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the lease term for up to five years and some of which include options to terminate the lease within one year. we consider these options in determining the lease term used to establish our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.
as most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.
we have lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components. for real estate leases, we account for lease components together with non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance).
table of contents components of lease cost are as follows:
operating lease cost (a)            $666                  $585                  $563

table of contents note 13 - acquisitions and divestitures juice transaction in the first quarter of 2022, we sold our tropicana, naked and other select juice brands to pai partners for approximately $3.5 billion in cash, subject to purchase price adjustments, and a 39% noncontrolling interest in tbg, operating across north america and europe. the north america portion of the transaction was completed on january 24, 2022 and the europe portion of the transaction was completed on february 1, 2022. in the united states, pepsico acts as the exclusive distributor for tbg's portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled dsd. we have significant influence over our investment in tbg and account for our investment under the equity method, recognizing our proportionate share of tbg's earnings on our income statement (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses).
as a result of this transaction, in the year ended december 31, 2022, we recorded a gain in our pbna and europe divisions (see detailed income statement activity below), including $520 million related to the remeasurement of our 39% ownership in tbg at fair value using a combination of the transaction price, discounted cash flows and an option pricing model related to our liquidation preference in tbg. in the fourth quarter of 2022, we reached an agreement on final purchase price adjustments for net working capital and net debt amounts as of the transaction close date compared to targeted amounts set forth in the purchase agreement.

the juice transaction did not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations. as of december 30, 2023 and december 31, 2022, there were no amounts classified as held for sale.
in the year ended december 30, 2023, we recognized impairment charges related to our tbg investment. see notes 1 and 9 for further information.

note 14 - supply chain financing arrangements as part of our evolving market practices, we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers generally range from 60 to 90 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. we will continue to monitor economic conditions and market practice working with our suppliers to adjust as necessary. we also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions. under these agreements, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with pepsico to these participating global financial institutions. supplier participation in these financing arrangements is voluntary. our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective global financial institutions and we are not a party to these agreements. these financing arrangements allow participating suppliers to leverage pepsico's creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs, which generally provides our suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. neither pepsico nor any of its subsidiaries provide any guarantees to any third party in connection with these financing arrangements. we have no economic interest in our suppliers' decision to participate in these agreements. our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. all outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in such financing arrangements are recorded within accounts payable and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. as of both december 30, 2023 and december 31, 2022, $1.7 billion of our accounts payable are to suppliers participating in these financing arrangements.

table of contents report of independent registered public accounting firm to the shareholders and board of directors pepsico, inc.:
opinions on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of pepsico, inc. and subsidiaries (the company) as of december 30, 2023 and december 31, 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and equity for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended december 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). we also have audited the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 30, 2023, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company as of december 30, 2023 and december 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended december 30, 2023, in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. also in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 30, 2023 based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.
basis for opinions the company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob) and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
table of contents definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
critical audit matters the critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
sales incentive accruals as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the company offers sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. a number of the sales incentives are based on annual targets, resulting in the need to accrue for the expected liability. these incentives are accrued for in the "accounts payable and other current liabilities" line on the balance sheet. these accruals are based on sales incentive agreements, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation and performance levels, and historical experience and trends.
we identified the evaluation of certain of the company's sales incentive accruals as a critical audit matter. subjective and complex auditor judgment is required in evaluating these sales incentive accruals as a result of the timing difference between when the product is delivered and when the incentive is settled. this specifically related to (1) forecasted customer and consumer participation and performance level assumptions underlying the accrual, and (2) the impact of historical experience and trends.
the following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the sales incentive process, including controls related to (1) the accrual methodology, (2) assumptions around forecasted customer and consumer participation, (3) performance levels, and (4) monitoring of actual sales incentives incurred compared to estimated sales incentives in respect of historical periods. to evaluate the timing and amount of certain accrued sales incentives we (1) analyzed the accrual by sales incentive type as compared to historical trends to identify specific sales incentives that may require additional testing, (2) recalculated expenses and closing accruals on a sample basis, table of contents based on volumes sold and terms of the sales incentives, (3) assessed the company's ability to accurately estimate its sales incentive accrual by comparing previously established accruals to actual settlements, and (4) tested a sample of settlements or claims that occurred after period end, and compared them to the recorded sales incentive accrual.
carrying value of certain reacquired and acquired franchise rights and sodastream goodwill as discussed in notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the company performs impairment testing of its goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis during the third quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. the carrying value of other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of december 30, 2023 was $13.7 billion, which represents 13.7% of total assets, and includes certain pepsico beverages north america's (pbna) reacquired and acquired franchise rights, which had a carrying value of $8.7 billion as of december 30, 2023. the carrying value of goodwill as of december 30, 2023 was $17.7 billion, which represents 17.6% of total assets, and includes goodwill related to the sodastream reporting unit in europe.
we identified the assessment of the carrying value of pbna's reacquired and acquired franchise rights and sodastream goodwill in europe as a critical audit matter. the impairment analysis of these indefinite-lived intangible assets required significant auditor judgment to evaluate the company's forecasted revenue and profitability levels, including the expected long-term growth rates and the selection of the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows. significant auditor judgment was necessary to assess the subjective and uncertain impact of competitive operating and macroeconomic factors on future levels of revenue, operating profit and cash flows.
the following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment process, including controls related to the development of forecasted revenue, profitability levels, expected long-term growth rates, and selection of the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. we also evaluated the sensitivity of the company's conclusion related to changes in assumptions, including the assessment of changes in assumptions from prior periods. to assess the company's ability to accurately forecast, we compared the company's historical forecasted results to actual results. we compared forecasted revenue and profitability levels in the cash flow projections used in the impairment tests with available external industry data and other internal information. we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating (1) the long-term growth rates used in the impairment tests by comparing against economic data and information specific to the respective assets, including projected long-term nominal gross domestic product growth in the respective local countries, and (2) the discount rates used in the impairment tests by comparing them against discount rates that were independently developed using publicly available market data, including that of comparable companies.
unrecognized tax benefits as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the company's global operating model gives rise to income tax obligations in the united states and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which it operates. as of december 30, 2023, the company recorded reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $2.1 billion. the company establishes reserves if it believes that certain positions taken in its tax returns are subject to challenge and the company likely will not succeed, even though the company believes the tax return position is supportable under the tax law. the company adjusts table of contents these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of new information, such as the progress of a tax examination, new tax law, relevant court rulings or tax authority settlements.
we identified the evaluation of certain of the company's unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter because the application of tax law and interpretation of a tax authority's settlement history is complex and involves subjective judgment. such judgments impact both the timing and amount of the reserves that are recognized, including judgments about re-measuring liabilities for positions taken in prior years' tax returns in light of new information.
the following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the unrecognized tax benefits process, including controls to (1) identify uncertain income tax positions, (2) evaluate the tax law and tax authority's settlement history used to estimate the unrecognized tax benefits, and (3) monitor for new information that may give rise to changes to the existing unrecognized tax benefits, such as progress of a tax examination, new tax law or tax authority settlements. we involved tax and valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in assessing the unrecognized tax benefits by (1) evaluating the company's tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, and (2) assessing the company's interpretation of existing tax law as well as new and amended tax laws, tax positions taken, associated external counsel opinions, information from tax examinations, relevant court rulings and tax authority settlements.

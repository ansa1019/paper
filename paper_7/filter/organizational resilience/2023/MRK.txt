description of merck's business merck & co., inc. (merck or the company) is a global health care company that delivers innovative health solutions through its prescription medicines, including biologic therapies, vaccines and animal health products. the company's operations are principally managed on a product basis and include two operating segments, pharmaceutical and animal health, both of which are reportable segments.
the pharmaceutical segment includes human health pharmaceutical and vaccine products. human health pharmaceutical products consist of therapeutic and preventive agents, generally sold by prescription, for the treatment of human disorders. the company sells these human health pharmaceutical products primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed health care providers such as health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers and other institutions. human health vaccine products consist of preventive pediatric, adolescent and adult vaccines. the company sells these human health vaccines primarily to physicians, wholesalers, distributors and government entities.
the animal health segment discovers, develops, manufactures and markets a wide range of veterinary pharmaceutical and vaccine products, as well as health management solutions and services, for the prevention, treatment and control of disease in all major livestock and companion animal species. the company also offers an extensive suite of digitally connected identification, traceability and monitoring products. the company sells its products to veterinarians, distributors, animal producers, farmers and pet owners.
on june 2, 2021, merck completed the spin-off of products from its women's health, biosimilars and established brands businesses into a new, independent, publicly traded company named organon & co. (organon) through a distribution of organon's publicly traded stock to company shareholders. the established brands included in the transaction consisted of dermatology, non-opioid pain management, respiratory, select cardiovascular products, as well as the rest of merck's diversified brands franchise. the historical results of the businesses that were contributed to organon in the spin-off have been reflected as discontinued operations in the company's consolidated financial statements through the date of the spin-off (see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).

executive summary merck's performance during 2023 reflects strong execution of its science-led strategy. the company benefited from strong underlying demand across its innovative portfolio, made disciplined investments to leverage table of contents leading edge science, and advanced its broad pipeline which includes growing diversity across new therapeutic areas and modalities. additionally, merck completed several strategic business development transactions and returned capital to shareholders, primarily through dividends.
worldwide sales were $60.1 billion in 2023, an increase of 1% compared with 2022, or 4% excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. the sales increase was primarily due to growth in oncology, vaccines, hospital acute care and animal health, partially offset by declines in virology (driven by lower sales of covid-19 medication lagevrio) and diabetes.
merck continues to execute strategic business development opportunities to augment its robust internal pipeline with compelling external science. highlights of 2023 activity include the following:
•entered into a global development and commercialization agreement for three of daiichi sankyo's deruxtecan (dxd) antibody drug conjugate (adc) candidates, which are in various stages of clinical development for the treatment of multiple solid tumors both as monotherapy and/or in combination with other treatments.
•acquired prometheus biosciences, inc. (prometheus), a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering a precision medicine approach for the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel therapeutic and companion diagnostic products for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases including ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease, and other autoimmune conditions.
•closed a license and collaboration agreement expanding the company's relationship with kelun-biotech pursuant to which merck gained exclusive rights for the research, development, manufacture and commercialization of up to now five investigational preclinical adcs for the treatment of cancer (kelun-biotech retained rights for certain licensed and option adcs for chinese mainland, hong kong and macau).
•acquired imago biosciences, inc. (imago), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing new medicines for the treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms and other bone marrow diseases.
during 2023, the company received more than 25 regulatory approvals in major markets, including numerous regulatory approvals within oncology. keytruda received approval for additional indications in the u.s. and/or internationally as monotherapy in the therapeutic areas of non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) and primary mediastinal large b-cell lymphoma (pmbcl), in combination with chemotherapy in the therapeutic areas of biliary tract cancer, gastric or gastroesophageal junction (gej) adenocarcinoma and nsclc, as well as in combination with padcev (enfortunab vedotin-ejfv) for advanced urothelial cancer. lynparza, which is being developed in collaboration with astrazeneca plc (astrazeneca), received approvals in the u.s. in combination with abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone and in japan in combination with abiraterone and prednisolone - both for the treatment of certain adult patients with brca-mutated (brcam) metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mcrpc). welireg was approved for a supplemental indication in the u.s. for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (rcc) following a programmed death receptor-1 (pd-1) or programmed death-ligand (pd-l1) inhibitor and a vascular endothelial growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (vegf-tki).
additionally, in 2023, prevymis was approved for a supplemental indication in both the u.s. and the eu for prophylaxis (prevention) of cytomegalovirus (cmv) disease in certain adult kidney transplant recipients at high risk.
•mk-7962, sotatercept, a novel investigational activin signaling inhibitor is under priority review by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) and under review by the european medicines agency for the treatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah).
•v116, an investigational 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia in adults, is also under priority review by the fda.
•mk-1022, patritumab deruxtecan, is an adc being evaluated for the treatment of certain types of nsclc under priority review by the fda. patritumab deruxtecan is part of a collaboration with daiichi sankyo.
•additionally, keytruda is under review in the u.s. and/or in international markets for supplemental indications for the treatment of certain patients with biliary tract, cervical, endometrial, gastric, non-small-cell lung and urothelial cancers.
•welireg is under review in the eu for the treatment of certain patients with advanced rcc and for the treatment of von hippel-lindau disease.
during 2023, the company initiated more than 20 phase 3 studies across multiple asset classes, including the progression of eight novel candidates.
the company is diversifying its oncology portfolio and executing on its strategy which is broadly based on three strategic pillars: immuno-oncology, precision molecular targeting and tissue targeting. merck's phase 3 oncology programs within these pillars are as follows:
•keytruda in the therapeutic areas of cutaneous squamous cell, hepatocellular, mesothelioma, ovarian and small-cell lung cancers;
•mk-1308a, the coformulation of quavonlimab, merck's novel investigational anti-ctla-4 antibody, and pembrolizumab for rcc;
•mk-3475a, the subcutaneous coformulation of pembrolizumab with hyaluronidase for certain types of nsclc;
•mk-4280a, the coformulation of favezelimab, merck's novel investigational anti-lag3 therapy, and pembrolizumab for colorectal cancer and hematological malignancies;
•mk-7684a, the coformulation of vibostolimab, an anti-tigit therapy, and pembrolizumab for certain types of melanoma, non-small-cell and small-cell lung cancers; and
•v940, an investigational individualized neoantigen therapy, in combination with keytruda, for certain types of melanoma and nsclc, being developed in collaboration with moderna.
•lenvima, being developed in collaboration with eisai co., ltd. (eisai), in combination with keytruda for certain types of esophageal and gastric cancers;
•mk-5684, an investigational cytochrome p450 11a1 (cyp11a1) inhibitor being developed in collaboration with orion corporation (orion) for mcrpc.
•mk-2870, an investigational trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (trop2)-directed adc being developed in collaboration with kelun-biotech for endometrial carcinoma and certain types of nsclc.
additionally, the company currently has candidates in phase 3 clinical development in several other therapeutic areas including:
•mk-1654, clesrovimab, a human monoclonal antibody for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (rsv);
•mk-7240, tulisokibart, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed to tumor necrosis factor-like ligand 1a, a target associated with both intestinal inflammation and fibrosis, for ulcerative colitis;
•mk-8591a, islatravir, an investigational nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor, in combination with doravirine for the treatment of hiv-1 infection (which is on partial clinical hold for higher doses than those used in current clinical trials); and
•mk-4482, lagevrio, which is reflected in phase 3 development in the u.s. as it remains investigational following emergency use authorization (eua) in 2021.
merck's capital allocation strategy continues to prioritize investments in its business to drive near- and long-term growth, including investing in opportunities to address important unmet medical needs and supporting the company's commercial opportunities. in addition, merck remains committed to its dividend and will continue to pursue the most compelling external science and technologies through value-enhancing business development transactions. research and development expenses in 2023 reflect higher charges for business development transactions and increased development spending particularly in the therapeutic areas of oncology, cardiovascular, infectious diseases and vaccines.
in november 2023, merck's board of directors approved an increase to the company's quarterly dividend, raising it to $0.77 per share from $0.73 per share on the company's outstanding common stock. during 2023, the company returned $8.8 billion to shareholders through dividends of $7.4 billion and share repurchases of $1.3 billion.
gaap and non-gaap eps were negatively affected in 2023, 2022 and 2021 by $6.21, $0.22, and $0.65, respectively, of charges for certain upfront and pre-approval milestone payments related to collaborations and licensing agreements, as well as charges related to pre-approval assets obtained in transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions.
pricing global efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access worldwide. changes to the u.s. health care system enacted in prior years as part of health care reform, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of medicare, medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, have contributed to pricing pressure. in several international markets, government-mandated pricing actions have reduced prices of generic and patented drugs. in addition, the company's sales performance in 2023 was negatively affected by other cost-reduction measures taken by governments and other third parties to lower health care costs. in 2022, the u.s. congress passed the inflation reduction act (ira), which makes significant changes to how drugs are covered and paid for under the medicare program, including the creation of financial penalties for drugs whose prices rise faster than the rate of inflation, redesign of the medicare part d program to require manufacturers to bear more of the liability for certain drug benefits, and government price-setting for certain medicare part d drugs (starting in 2026) and medicare part b drugs (starting in 2028). in august 2023, the u.s. department of health and human services (hhs), through the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms), announced that januvia will be included in the first year of the ira's "drug price negotiation program" (program). pursuant to the ira's program, discussions with the government occurred in 2023 and will continue in 2024, with government price-setting becoming effective on january 1, 2026. the company has sued the u.s. government regarding the ira's program (see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements). furthermore, the biden table of contents administration and congress continue to discuss legislation designed to control health care costs, including the cost of drugs. the company anticipates all of these actions and additional actions in the future will negatively affect sales and profits.

worldwide sales grew 1% to $60.1 billion in 2023 primarily due to higher sales in the oncology franchise, largely due to strong growth of keytruda and welireg, as well as increased alliance revenue from lenvima and lynparza. also contributing to revenue growth were higher sales in the vaccines franchise, primarily attributable to growth of combined sales of gardasil/gardasil 9 and the ongoing launch of vaxneuvance for pediatric use. higher sales of hospital acute care products, including prevymis and bridion, as well as higher sales of animal health products also drove revenue growth in 2023. sales growth in 2023 was largely offset by lower sales in the virology franchise, largely due to lagevrio, as well as isentress/isentress hd. lower sales in the diabetes franchise, due to januvia and janumet, lower sales of the pneumovax 23 vaccine, and lower revenue from third-party manufacturing arrangements also offset sales growth in 2023.
sales in the u.s. grew 5% to $28.5 billion in 2023 primarily driven by higher sales of keytruda, vaxneuvance, bridion and welireg. revenue growth in the u.s. in 2023 was partially offset by lower sales of lagevrio, pneumovax 23, janumet, januvia, and lower revenue from third-party manufacturing arrangements.
international sales declined 1% in 2023 primarily due to lower sales of lagevrio, januvia, janumet, and isentress/isentress hd. the international sales decline in 2023 was largely offset by higher combined sales of gardasil/gardasil 9, as well as higher sales of keytruda, prevymis and vaxneuvance. international sales represented 53% and 54% of total sales in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for details on sales of the company's products. a discussion of performance for select products in the franchises follows.

keytruda is an anti-pd-1 therapy that has been approved in over 35 indications in the u.s., including 17 tumor types and 2 tumor-agnostic indications, and has similarly been approved in markets worldwide for many of these indications. the keytruda clinical development program includes studies across a broad range of cancer types.
global sales of keytruda grew 19% in 2023 primarily driven by higher demand reflecting the launch of multiple new indications globally coupled with continued uptake in existing indications. sales growth in the u.s. reflects increased uptake across earlier-stage indications including in high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (tnbc), as well as certain types of rcc and melanoma, and higher demand across the multiple approved table of contents metastatic indications, in particular for the treatment of certain types of rcc, nsclc, tnbc, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc), endometrial and bladder cancers, as well as higher pricing. keytruda sales growth in international markets reflects higher demand predominately for the tnbc and rcc earlier-stage indications, as well as uptake in hnscc and rcc metastatic indications, particularly in europe, latin america, and the asia pacific region, including japan.

combined worldwide sales of gardasil and gardasil 9, vaccines to help prevent certain cancers and other diseases caused by certain types of human papillomavirus (hpv), grew 29% in 2023 driven by strong demand outside of the u.s., particularly in china due in part to continued uptake of the expanded indication of gardasil 9 for girls and women 9 to 45 years of age. sales of gardasil 9 in the u.s. increased slightly due to higher pricing and demand, largely offset by public sector buying patterns.
the company is a party to certain third-party license agreements pursuant to which the company pays royalties on sales of gardasil/gardasil 9. under the terms of the more significant of these agreements, merck pays a 7% royalty on sales of gardasil/gardasil 9 in the u.s. to one third party (this royalty expires in december 2028); merck paid an additional 7% royalty on worldwide sales of gardasil/gardasil 9 to another third party, which expired in december 2023. the royalties are included in cost of sales.
global sales of proquad, a pediatric combination vaccine to help protect against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, grew 4% in 2023 primarily due to higher pricing in the u.s., partially offset by lower demand in europe.
worldwide sales of m-m-r ii, a vaccine to help protect against measles, mumps and rubella, grew 5% in 2023 primarily due to higher demand in certain international markets and higher pricing in the u.s., partially offset by lower demand in the u.s.
global sales of varivax, a vaccine to help prevent chickenpox (varicella), grew 8% in 2023 primarily attributable to higher pricing and demand in the u.s., as well as higher demand in the asia pacific region, partially offset by lower demand in latin america.
worldwide sales of vaxneuvance, a vaccine to help protect against invasive pneumococcal disease, increased to $665 million in 2023 primarily due to continued uptake in the pediatric indication in the u.s. and launches in european markets. vaxneuvance is currently launched in 19 markets with additional launches planned. merck is a party to a third-party license agreement pursuant to which the company pays a royalty of 7.25% on net sales of vaxneuvance through 2026; this royalty will decline to 2.5% on net sales from 2027 through 2035. the royalties are included in cost of sales.
worldwide sales of pneumovax 23, a vaccine to help prevent pneumococcal disease, declined 32% in 2023 due to lower demand in the u.s. as the market continues to shift toward newer adult pneumococcal conjugate vaccines following changes in the recommendations of the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention's advisory committee on immunization practices in 2021. the company expects the decline in u.s. sales of pneumovax 23 to continue. the pneumovax 23 u.s. sales decline in 2023 was partially offset by higher demand in several international markets.

global sales of bridion, for the reversal of two types of neuromuscular blocking agents used during surgery, grew 9% in 2023 reflecting higher demand in the u.s., attributable in part to bridion's increased share among neuromuscular blockade reversal agents, as well as higher pricing, partially offset by generic competition in table of contents international markets, particularly in the eu. the patent that provided market exclusivity for bridion in the eu expired in july 2023. accordingly, the company is experiencing sales declines of bridion in these markets and expects the declines to continue. the patent that provided market exclusivity for bridion in japan expired in january 2024; the company anticipates sales of bridion in japan will decline in future periods.
worldwide sales of prevymis, a medicine for prophylaxis (prevention) of cmv infection and disease in certain high risk adult recipients of an allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant and for prophylaxis of cmv disease in certain high risk adult recipients of a kidney transplant, grew 41% in 2023 largely due to higher demand in the u.s. and europe, as well as continued uptake from the 2022 launch in china. in june 2023, the fda approved prevymis for prophylaxis of cmv disease in certain adult kidney transplant recipients at high risk following priority review, based on the p002 clinical trial. in november 2023, the ec also approved prevymis for this indication.

(1) alliance revenue represents merck's share of profits from sales in bayer's marketing territories, which are product sales net of cost of sales and commercialization costs (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).
adempas and verquvo are part of a worldwide collaboration with bayer ag (bayer) to market and develop soluble guanylate cyclase (sgc) modulators (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). adempas is approved for the treatment of certain types of pah and chronic pulmonary hypertension. verquvo is approved to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization following a hospitalization for heart failure or need for outpatient intravenous diuretics in adults with symptomatic chronic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. verquvo was approved in the u.s., the eu and japan in 2021 and has since been approved in several other markets. alliance revenue from the collaboration grew 8% in 2023 reflecting higher profit sharing, which reflects increased demand in bayer's marketing territories. revenue also includes sales of adempas and verquvo in merck's marketing territories. sales of adempas in merck's marketing territories grew 7% in 2023 primarily reflecting higher demand.

lagevrio is an investigational oral antiviral covid-19 medicine being developed in a collaboration with ridgeback biotherapeutics lp (ridgeback) (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). following initial authorizations in certain markets in the fourth quarter of 2021, lagevrio has since received multiple additional authorizations. sales of lagevrio declined to $1.4 billion in 2023 compared with $5.7 billion in 2022. the decline in sales of lagevrio in 2023 primarily reflects sales of lagevrio in the uk in 2022 that did not recur in 2023, as well as lower sales in the u.s., japan and australia. sales of lagevrio in the u.s. in 2022 consisted of sales to the u.s. government. in november 2023, following authorization from the fda, the company began the transition from government supply to commercial distribution in the u.s. for lagevrio while under eua. in april 2023, japan's mhlw granted full approval for lagevrio. lagevrio was previously granted special approval for emergency in japan in december 2021. given that the company has fulfilled government purchase and supply commitments for lagevrio, as well as the waning impacts of the covid-19 pandemic, the company expects sales of lagevrio will decline in 2024.
worldwide combined sales of isentress/isentress hd, an hiv integrase inhibitor for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of hiv-1 infection, declined 24% in 2023 primarily due to competitive pressure particularly in the u.s. and europe. the patent that provided market exclusivity for isentress/isentress hd in table of contents the eu expired in july 2023. accordingly, the company is experiencing sales declines of isentress/isentress hd in these markets as a result of generic competition and expects the declines to continue. additionally, the company anticipates competitive pressure and sales declines of isentress/isentress hd in the u.s. to continue.

worldwide combined sales of januvia and janumet, medicines that help lower blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes, declined 25% in 2023 primarily reflecting the ongoing impact of the loss of exclusivity in most markets in europe and the asia pacific region, as well as in canada, coupled with lower demand and lower pricing in the u.s. due to competitive pressures.
while the key u.s. patent for januvia and janumet claiming the sitagliptin compound expired in january 2023, as a result of favorable court rulings and settlement agreements related to a later expiring patent directed to the specific sitagliptin salt form of the products (see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements), the company expects that januvia and janumet will not lose market exclusivity in the u.s. until may 2026 and janumet xr will not lose market exclusivity in the u.s. until july 2026, although a non-automatically substitutable form of sitagliptin that differs from the form in the company's sitagliptin products has been approved by the fda. as a result of competitive pressures, the company anticipates pricing and volume declines for januvia and janumet in the u.s. to continue in 2024 and thereafter. in august 2023, the u.s. department of hhs, through the cms, announced that januvia will be included in the first year of the ira's program. pursuant to the ira's program, discussions with the government occurred in 2023 and will continue in 2024, with government price-setting becoming effective on january 1, 2026. the company has sued the u.s. government regarding the ira's program (see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements).
the company lost market exclusivity for januvia in all of the eu and for janumet in some european countries in september 2022. exclusivity for janumet was lost in other european countries in april 2023. accordingly, the company is experiencing sales declines in these markets and expects the declines to continue. while the company lost market exclusivity for januvia in china in 2022 with the launch of a generic equivalent product and an additional generic equivalent product was launched in 2023, the impact to sales in 2023 was modest. several generic equivalents of janumet have been approved in china, and one launched in december 2023 via a settlement agreement with the company.
combined sales of januvia and janumet in europe, china and the u.s. represented 9%, 14% and 41%, respectively, of total combined januvia and janumet sales in 2023.
in response to a request from a regulatory authority in 2022, merck evaluated its sitagliptin-containing products for the presence of nitrosamines. nitrosamines are organic compounds found at trace levels in water and food. nitrosamines can also result from chemical reactions and can form in drugs either due to the drug's manufacturing process, chemical structure, or the conditions in which the drugs are stored or packaged. the company detected a nitrosamine identified as nitroso-stg-19 (nttp) in some batches of its sitagliptin-containing medicines. the company has engaged with major health authorities around the world and has implemented additional quality controls to ensure its portfolio of sitagliptin-containing products meet health authorities' interim acceptable nttp limits for continuing distribution of product to the market. the company has made significant progress in reducing the level of nitrosamines in its sitagliptin-containing medicines and is now consistently releasing product in major markets that is expected to comply with the health authorities' long-term limit throughout product shelf-life. the company does not anticipate product shortages at this time.

sales of livestock products grew 1% in 2023 primarily due to higher pricing, as well as increased demand for poultry and swine products, partially offset by lower demand for ruminant products. sales of companion animal products grew 2% in 2023 reflecting higher pricing, partially offset by lower demand. sales of the bravecto line of products were $1.1 billion in 2023, an increase of 4% compared with 2022, or 5% excluding the impact of foreign exchange.

cost of sales cost of sales was $16.1 billion in 2023 and $17.4 billion in 2022. cost of sales includes $852 million and $3.0 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to sales of lagevrio, which is being developed in a collaboration with ridgeback (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). cost of sales also includes the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions, collaborations, and licensing arrangements, which totaled $2.0 billion in both 2023 and 2022. amortization expense in 2023 and 2022 includes $154 million and $250 million, respectively, of cumulative catch-up amortization related to merck's collaborations with eisai and astrazeneca, respectively (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). also included in cost of sales are expenses associated with restructuring activities, which amounted to $211 million in 2023 and $205 million in 2022, primarily reflecting accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs related to the planned sale or closure of manufacturing facilities. separation costs associated with manufacturing-related headcount reductions have been incurred and are reflected in restructuring costs as discussed below.
gross margin was 73.2% in 2023 compared with 70.6% in 2022. the gross margin improvement primarily reflects the favorable impacts of product mix, including lower lagevrio sales and lower revenue from third-party manufacturing arrangements (both of which have lower gross margins), and lower manufacturing-related costs, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses were $10.5 billion in 2023, an increase of 5% compared with 2022. the increase was primarily due to higher administrative costs, including compensation and benefits, and increased promotional spending and selling costs, partially offset by the favorable effect of foreign exchange and lower acquisition-related costs.
table of contents research and development research and development (r&d) expenses were $30.5 billion in 2023 compared with $13.5 billion in 2022. the increase was primarily due to higher charges for business development activity in 2023, including charges of $10.2 billion for the acquisition of prometheus, $5.5 billion related to the formation of a collaboration with daiichi sankyo and $1.2 billion for the acquisition of imago, compared with charges of $690 million in aggregate recorded in 2022 related to collaboration and licensing agreements with moderna, orna therapeutics and orion. the increase in r&d expenses was also attributable to higher development spending, including for recently acquired programs, and higher compensation and benefit costs (reflecting in part increased headcount). the increase in r&d expenses was partially offset by lower intangible asset impairment charges in 2023.
r&d expenses are comprised of the costs directly incurred by merck research laboratories (mrl), the company's research and development division that focuses on human health-related activities, which were $9.0 billion in 2023 and $7.7 billion in 2022. also included in r&d expenses are animal health research costs, upfront payments for collaboration and licensing agreements (including charges for the daiichi sankyo, moderna, orna and orion transactions noted above), charges for transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions (including the charges for prometheus and imago noted above) and costs incurred by other divisions in support of r&d activities, including depreciation, production and general and administrative, which in the aggregate were $20.7 billion in 2023 and $4.1 billion in 2022. r&d expenses also include impairment charges of $779 million in 2023 (related to gefapixant) and $1.7 billion in 2022 (largely related to nemtabrutinib). see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these impairment charges. the company may recognize additional impairment charges in the future related to the cancellation or delay of other pipeline programs that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with business combinations and such charges could be material.
restructuring costs in january 2024, the company approved a new restructuring program (2024 restructuring program) intended to continue the optimization of the company's human health global manufacturing network as the future pipeline shifts to new modalities and also optimize the animal health global manufacturing network to improve supply reliability and increase efficiency. the actions contemplated under the 2024 restructuring program are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2031, with the cumulative pretax costs to be incurred by the company to implement the program estimated to be approximately $4.0 billion. approximately 60% of the cumulative pretax costs will be non-cash, relating primarily to the accelerated depreciation of facilities to be closed or divested. the remainder of the costs will result in cash outlays, relating primarily to facility shut-down costs. the company expects to record charges of approximately $750 million in 2024 related to the 2024 restructuring program. the company anticipates the actions under the 2024 restructuring program will result in cumulative annual net cost savings of approximately $750 million by the end of 2031.
in 2019, merck approved a global restructuring program (2019 restructuring program) as part of a worldwide initiative focused on optimizing the company's manufacturing and supply network, as well as reducing its global real estate footprint. the actions under the 2019 restructuring program are substantially complete.
restructuring costs of $599 million in 2023 and $337 million in 2022 include separation and other costs associated with these restructuring activities. separation costs incurred were associated with actual headcount reductions, as well as estimated expenses under existing severance programs for involuntary headcount reductions that were probable and could be reasonably estimated. other expenses in restructuring costs include facility shut-down and other related costs, as well as employee-related costs such as curtailment, settlement and termination charges associated with pension and other postretirement benefit plans and share-based compensation plan costs. for segment reporting, restructuring costs are unallocated expenses.
additional costs associated with the company's restructuring activities are included in cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development costs. the company recorded aggregate pretax costs related to restructuring program activities of $933 million in 2023 (of which $190 million related to the 2024 restructuring program) and $666 million in 2022. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.
other (income) expense, net other (income) expense, net, was $466 million of expense in 2023 compared with $1.5 billion of expense in 2022. the change was primarily due to net gains from investments in equity securities recorded in 2023, compared with net losses from investments in equity securities recorded in 2022, as well as lower pension settlement costs in 2023, partially offset by a $572.5 million charge in 2023 related to settlements with certain plaintiffs in the zetia antitrust litigation (see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements) and higher foreign exchange losses.

animal health segment profits                               1,737                      1,963                     1,950
pharmaceutical segment profits are comprised of segment sales less standard costs, as well as sg&a expenses directly incurred by the segment. animal health segment profits are comprised of segment sales, less all cost of sales, as well as sg&a and r&d expenses directly incurred by the segment. for internal management reporting presented to the chief operating decision maker, merck does not allocate the remaining cost of sales not included in segment profits as described above, r&d expenses incurred by mrl, or general and administrative expenses not directly incurred by the segments, nor the cost of financing these activities. separate divisions maintain responsibility for monitoring and managing these costs, including depreciation related to fixed assets utilized by these divisions and, therefore, they are not included in segment profits. also excluded from the determination of segment profits are costs related to restructuring activities and acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, including the amortization of intangible assets and amortization of purchase accounting adjustments, intangible asset impairment charges, and expense or income related to changes in the estimated fair value measurement of liabilities for contingent consideration. additionally, segment profits do not reflect other expenses from corporate and manufacturing cost centers and other miscellaneous income or expense. these unallocated items are reflected in "other" in the above table. also included in "other" are miscellaneous corporate profits (losses), as well as operating profits (losses) related to third-party manufacturing arrangements.
pharmaceutical segment profits grew 6% in 2023 primarily due to higher sales, partially offset by higher administrative and promotional costs, as well as the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. animal health segment profits declined 12% in 2023 reflecting higher production costs, higher inventory write-offs, increased administrative and promotional costs, as well as the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange.
taxes on income the effective income tax rates from continuing operations were 80.0% in 2023 and 11.7% in 2022. the high tax rate from continuing operations in 2023 includes a 65.6 percentage point combined unfavorable impact of charges for the acquisitions of prometheus and imago (for which no tax benefits were recognized) and the daiichi sankyo collaboration. these charges reduced domestic pretax income by approximately $16.9 billion in 2023. in addition, the tax rate from continuing operations in 2023 reflects higher foreign taxes and the impact of the r&d capitalization provision of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (tcja) on the company's u.s. global intangible low-taxed income inclusion, partially offset by a favorable mix of income and expense, as well as higher foreign tax credits. the tax rate from continuing operations in 2022 reflects a favorable mix of income and expense. the tax rate from continuing operations in 2022 also reflects the favorable impact of net unrealized losses from investments in equity securities and intangible asset impairment charges, which were taxed at the u.s. tax rate; these items reduced domestic pretax income by approximately $2.9 billion in 2022.
while many jurisdictions in which merck operates have adopted the global minimum tax provision of the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd) pillar 2, effective for tax years beginning in january 2024, the company anticipates there will be a minimal impact to its 2024 tax rate due to the accounting for the tax effects of intercompany transactions. the company expects the impact of the global minimum tax will increase its tax rate to a greater extent in 2025 and thereafter. also, in the event that the provision of the tcja requiring capitalization and amortization of r&d expenses for tax purposes is repealed along the lines recently proposed in the tax relief for american families and workers act of 2024, the company will again be able to realize the benefit of u.s. r&d expenses as incurred, but expects no material impact to its effective income tax rate.
table of contents non-gaap income and non-gaap eps from continuing operations non-gaap income and non-gaap eps are alternative views of the company's performance that merck is providing because management believes this information enhances investors' understanding of the company's results since management uses non-gaap measures to assess performance. non-gaap income and non-gaap eps exclude certain items because of the nature of these items and the impact that they have on the analysis of underlying business performance and trends. the excluded items (which should not be considered non-recurring) consist of acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, restructuring costs, income and losses from investments in equity securities, and certain other items. these excluded items are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance.
non-gaap income and non-gaap eps are important internal measures for the company. senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes a non-gaap eps metric. management uses non-gaap measures internally for planning and forecasting purposes and to measure the performance of the company along with other metrics. in addition, annual employee compensation, including senior management's compensation, is derived in part using a non-gaap pretax income metric. since non-gaap income and non-gaap eps are not measures determined in accordance with gaap, they have no standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and, therefore, may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. the information on non-gaap income and non-gaap eps should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, net income and eps prepared in accordance with gaap.
a reconciliation between gaap financial measures and non-gaap financial measures (from continuing operations) is as follows:
income from continuing operations before taxes as reported under gaap                           $1,889                  $16,444                 $13,879

(1)amounts in 2023, 2022 and 2021 include $792 million, $1.7 billion and $302 million, respectively, of intangible asset impairment charges.
(2) the estimated tax impact on the excluded items is determined by applying the statutory rate of the originating territory of the non-gaap adjustments.
(3)    gaap and non-gaap eps were negatively affected in 2023, 2022 and 2021 by $6.21, $0.22, and $0.65, respectively, of charges for certain upfront and pre-approval milestone payments related to collaborations and licensing agreements, as well as charges related to pre-approval assets obtained in transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions.
acquisition- and divestiture-related costs non-gaap income and non-gaap eps exclude the impact of certain amounts recorded in connection with acquisitions and divestitures of businesses. these amounts include the amortization of intangible assets and amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to inventories, as well as intangible asset impairment charges, and table of contents expense or income related to changes in the estimated fair value measurement of liabilities for contingent consideration. also excluded are integration, transaction, and certain other costs associated with acquisitions and divestitures. non-gaap income and non-gaap eps also exclude amortization of intangible assets related to collaborations and licensing arrangements.
restructuring costs non-gaap income and non-gaap eps exclude costs related to restructuring actions (see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). these amounts include employee separation costs and accelerated depreciation associated with facilities to be closed or divested. accelerated depreciation costs represent the difference between the depreciation expense to be recognized over the revised useful life of the asset, based upon the anticipated date the site will be closed or divested or the equipment disposed of, and depreciation expense as determined utilizing the useful life prior to the restructuring actions. restructuring costs also include asset abandonment, facility shut-down and other related costs, as well as employee-related costs such as curtailment, settlement and termination charges associated with pension and other postretirement benefit plans and share-based compensation costs.
certain other items non-gaap income and non-gaap eps exclude certain other items. these items are adjusted for after evaluating them on an individual basis, considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects. typically, these consist of items that are unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of future operating results. excluded from non-gaap income and non-gaap eps is a charge related to settlements with certain plaintiffs in the zetia antitrust litigation (see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements), charges related to the discontinuation of covid-19 development programs, as well as a net tax benefit related to the settlement of certain federal income tax matters (see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).
research and development research pipeline the company currently has several candidates under regulatory review in the u.s. and internationally, as well as in late-stage clinical development. a chart reflecting the company's current research pipeline as of february 23, 2024 and related discussion is set forth in item 1. "business - research and development" above.
acquisitions, research collaborations and licensing agreements merck continues to remain focused on pursuing opportunities that have the potential to drive both near- and long-term growth. certain recent transactions are summarized below; additional details are included in note 3 and note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. merck actively monitors the landscape for growth opportunities that meet the company's strategic criteria.
in january 2024, merck entered into an agreement to acquire harpoon therapeutics, inc. (harpoon), a clinical-stage immunotherapy company developing a novel class of t-cell engagers designed to harness the power of the body's immune system to treat patients suffering from cancer and other diseases. under the terms of the agreement, merck will acquire all outstanding shares of harpoon for $23 per share in cash, for an approximate total equity value of $680 million. harpoon's lead candidate, hpn328, is a t-cell engager targeting delta-like ligand 3 (dll3), an inhibitory canonical notch ligand that is expressed at high levels in small-cell lung cancer and neuroendocrine tumors. hpn328 is currently being evaluated in a phase 1/2 clinical trial as a monotherapy in patients with advanced cancers associated with expression of dll3 and also in combination with atezolizumab in patients with certain types of small-cell lung cancer. closing of the acquisition is expected in the first half of 2024, but is subject to certain conditions, including approval of the merger by harpoon's stockholders, the expiration of the waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act, and other customary conditions. if the proposed transaction closes, the company anticipates it will be accounted for as an acquisition of an asset. the company expects to record a charge of approximately $650 million to research and development expenses upon closing, or approximately $0.26 per share.
in october 2023, merck and daiichi sankyo entered into a global development and commercialization agreement for three of daiichi sankyo's deruxtecan (dxd) adc candidates: patritumab deruxtecan (her3-dxd) (mk-1022), ifinatamab deruxtecan (i-dxd) (mk-2400) and raludotatug deruxtecan (r-dxd) (mk-5909). all three potentially first-in-class dxd adcs are in various stages of clinical development for the treatment of multiple solid tumors both as monotherapy and/or in combination with other treatments. the companies will jointly develop and table of contents potentially commercialize these adc candidates worldwide, except in japan where daiichi sankyo will maintain exclusive rights. daiichi sankyo will be solely responsible for manufacturing and supply. under the terms of the agreement, merck made upfront payments of $4.0 billion and will make two one-time continuation payments of $750 million each to daiichi sankyo. additionally, daiichi sankyo is eligible to receive future contingent sales-based milestone payments. merck recorded an aggregate pretax charge of $5.5 billion to research and development expenses, or $1.69 per share, in 2023 related to the transaction.
in june 2023, merck acquired prometheus, a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering a precision medicine approach for the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel therapeutic and companion diagnostic products for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases. total consideration paid of $11.0 billion included $1.2 billion of costs to settle share-based equity awards (including $700 million to settle unvested equity awards). prometheus' lead candidate, tulisokibart, mk-7240 (formerly pra023), is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed to tumor necrosis factor-like ligand 1a, a target associated with both intestinal inflammation and fibrosis. tulisokibart is being developed for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases including ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease, and other autoimmune conditions. a phase 3 clinical trial evaluating tulisokibart for ulcerative colitis commenced in 2023. the transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of an asset. merck recorded net assets of $877 million, as well as a charge of $10.2 billion to research and development expenses, or $4.00 per share, in 2023 related to the transaction. there are no future contingent payments associated with the acquisition.
in february 2023, merck and kelun-biotech closed a license and collaboration agreement expanding their relationship in which merck gained exclusive rights for the research, development, manufacture and commercialization of up to seven investigational preclinical adcs for the treatment of cancer. kelun-biotech retained the right to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize certain licensed and option adcs for chinese mainland, hong kong and macau. merck made an upfront payment of $175 million, which was recorded in research and development expenses in 2023. in october 2023, merck notified kelun-biotech it was terminating two of the seven candidates under the agreement. kelun-biotech remains eligible to receive future contingent milestone payments and tiered royalties on future net sales for any commercialized adc product. also, in connection with the agreement, merck invested $100 million in kelun-biotech shares in january 2023.
in january 2023, merck acquired imago, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing new medicines for the treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms and other bone marrow diseases, for $1.35 billion (including payments to settle share-based equity awards) and also incurred approximately $60 million of transaction costs. imago's lead candidate bomedemstat, mk-3543 (formerly img-7289), is an investigational orally available lysine-specific demethylase 1 inhibitor currently being evaluated in multiple clinical trials for the treatment of essential thrombocythemia, myelofibrosis, and polycythemia vera, in addition to other indications. a phase 3 clinical trial evaluating bomedemstat for the treatment of certain patients with essential thrombocythemia is underway. the transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of an asset. merck recorded net assets of $219 million, as well as a charge of $1.2 billion to research and development expenses in 2023 related to the transaction. there are no future contingent payments associated with the acquisition.
acquired in-process research and development in connection with business combinations, the company records the fair value of in-process research projects which, at the time of acquisition, had not yet reached technological feasibility. at december 31, 2023, the balance of in-process research and development (ipr&d) was $6.8 billion, primarily consisting of mk-7962 (sotatercept), $6.4 billion and mk-1026 (nemtabrutinib), $418 million. sotatercept is under review in the u.s. and the eu. nemtabrutinib is in phase 3 clinical development.
the ipr&d projects that remain in development are subject to the inherent risks and uncertainties in drug development and it is possible that the company will not be able to successfully develop and complete the ipr&d programs and profitably commercialize the underlying product candidates. the time periods to receive approvals from the fda and other regulatory agencies are subject to uncertainty. significant delays in the approval process, or the company's failure to obtain approval at all, would delay or prevent the company from realizing revenues from these products. additionally, if the ipr&d programs require additional clinical trial data than previously anticipated, or if the programs fail or are abandoned during development, then the company will not recover the fair value of the ipr&d recorded as an asset as of the acquisition date. if such circumstances were to occur, the company's future operating results could be adversely affected and the company may recognize impairment charges, which could be material.
in 2023, 2022, and 2021 the company recorded ipr&d impairment charges within research and development expenses of $779 million, $1.6 billion and $275 million, respectively (see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements).
table of contents additional research and development will be required before any of the remaining programs reach technological feasibility. the costs to complete the research projects will depend on whether the projects are brought to their final stages of development and are ultimately submitted to the fda or other regulatory agencies for approval.
capital expenditures capital expenditures were $3.9 billion in 2023, $4.4 billion in 2022 and $4.4 billion in 2021. expenditures in the u.s. were $2.5 billion in 2023, $2.7 billion in 2022 and $2.8 billion in 2021. the company invested more than $19 billion in capital expenditures from 2018-2022, more than half of which related to expenditures in the u.s. the company plans to invest approximately $18 billion in capital projects from 2023-2027, more than $10 billion of which relates to investments in the u.s., including expanding manufacturing capacity for oncology, vaccine and animal health products.
depreciation expense was $1.8 billion in 2023, $1.8 billion in 2022 and $1.6 billion in 2021, of which $1.2 billion in 2023, $1.3 billion in 2022 and $1.1 billion in 2021, related to locations in the u.s. total depreciation expense in 2023, 2022 and 2021 included accelerated depreciation of $140 million, $120 million and $91 million, respectively, associated with restructuring activities (see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements).
analysis of liquidity and capital resources merck's strong financial profile enables it to fund research and development, finance acquisitions and external alliances, support in-line products and maximize upcoming launches while providing significant cash returns to shareholders.
working capital                                                                        $6,474                  $11,483                   $6,394
cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations to total debt                0.4:1                    0.6:1                    0.4:1
the decline in working capital in 2023 compared with 2022 primarily reflects the use of cash and investments to fund business development activity, partially offset by strong operating performance and cash proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt.
cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $13.0 billion in 2023 compared with $19.1 billion in 2022. cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was reduced by upfront, milestone and option payments related to certain collaborations of $4.2 billion in 2023 (including payments related to the formation of a collaboration with daiichi sankyo) compared with $2.0 billion in 2022. cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in 2023 was also reduced by payment of $572.5 million for the previously disclosed zetia antitrust settlement. cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations continues to be the company's primary source of funds to finance operating needs, with excess cash serving as the primary source of funds to finance business development transactions, capital expenditures, dividends paid to shareholders and treasury stock purchases. the mandatory change in r&d capitalization rules that became effective for tax years beginning after december 31, 2021 (related to the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (tcja)), increased the amount of taxes the company pays in the u.s. beginning in 2022.
cash used in investing activities of continuing operations was $14.1 billion in 2023 compared with $5.0 billion in 2022. the higher use of cash in investing activities of continuing operations was primarily due to the acquisitions of prometheus and imago, partially offset by higher proceeds from sales of securities and other investments, including proceeds from the sale of seagen inc. common stock, lower capital expenditures and lower purchases of securities and other investments.
cash used in financing activities of continuing operations was $4.8 billion in 2023 compared with $9.1 billion in 2022. the lower use of cash in financing activities from continuing operations was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance debt (see below) and lower payments on long-term debt (see below), partially offset by treasury stock purchases, higher dividends paid to shareholders and lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
in may 2023, the company issued $6.0 billion principal amount of senior unsecured notes. the company used a portion of the $5.9 billion net proceeds from this offering to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid for the acquisition of prometheus, including related fees and expenses, and used the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes including to repay commercial paper borrowings and other indebtedness with upcoming maturities.
table of contents in december 2021, the company issued $8.0 billion principal amount of senior unsecured notes. merck used a portion the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings (including commercial paper borrowings in connection with merck's acquisition of acceleron), and other indebtedness, and also used an allocated amount to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, projects and partnerships in the company's priority environmental, social and governance (esg) areas.
in march 2021, the company filed a securities registration statement with the u.s. securities and exchange commission (sec) under the automatic shelf registration process available to "well-known seasoned issuers" which is effective for three years.
effective as of november 3, 2009, the company executed a full and unconditional guarantee of the then existing debt of its subsidiary merck sharp & dohme corp. (msd) and msd executed a full and unconditional guarantee of the then existing debt of the company (excluding commercial paper), including for payments of principal and interest. these guarantees do not extend to debt issued subsequent to that date.
in november 2023, merck's board of directors increased the quarterly dividend, declaring a quarterly dividend of $0.77 per share on the company's outstanding common stock for the first quarter of 2024 that was paid in january 2024. in january 2024, the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.77 per share on the company's outstanding common stock for the second quarter of 2024 payable in april 2024.
in 2018, merck's board of directors authorized purchases of up to $10 billion of merck's common stock for its treasury. the treasury stock purchase authorization has no time limit and will be made over time in open-market transactions, block transactions on or off an exchange, or in privately negotiated transactions. in 2023, the company purchased $1.3 billion (approximately 13 million shares) of its common stock for its treasury under this program. as of december 31, 2023, the company's remaining share repurchase authorization was $3.7 billion. the company did not purchase any shares of its common stock under this program in 2022. the company purchased $840 million of its common stock during 2021 under the authorized share repurchase program.
the company believes it maintains a conservative financial profile. the company places its cash and investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in its investment policy guidelines. these guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. the company does not participate in any off-balance sheet arrangements involving unconsolidated subsidiaries that provide financing or potentially expose the company to unrecorded financial obligations.
the company expects foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to be met through existing cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flows from operations, as well as commercial paper borrowings and long-term borrowings if needed. merck believes that its sources of financing will be adequate to meet its future requirements. the company's material cash requirements arising in the normal course of business primarily include:
debt obligations and interest payments - see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail of the company's debt obligations and the timing of expected future principal and interest payments.
tax liabilities - in connection with the enactment of the tcja, the company is required to pay a one-time transition tax, which the company has elected to pay over a period of eight years through 2025 as permitted under the tcja. additionally, the company has liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties. see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further information pertaining to the transition tax and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits.
operating leases - see note 10 to consolidated financial statements for further details of the company's lease obligations and the timing of expected future lease payments.
collaboration-related payments - the company has accrued liabilities for contingent sales-based milestone payments related to collaborations with astrazeneca and eisai where payment has been deemed probable by the company but remains subject to the achievement of the related sales-based milestone. additionally, the table of contents company has accrued liabilities for future continuation payments related to a collaboration with daiichi sankyo. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these future payments.
purchase obligations - purchase obligations are enforceable and legally binding obligations for purchases of goods and services including minimum inventory contracts, research and development and advertising. purchase obligations also include future inventory purchases the company has committed to in connection with certain divestitures. as of december 31, 2023, the company had total purchase obligations of $5.8 billion, of which $2.0 billion is estimated to be payable in 2024.
financial instruments market risk disclosures the company manages the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on its earnings, cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities through operational means and through the use of various financial instruments, including derivative instruments.
a significant portion of the company's revenues and earnings in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. the objectives of and accounting related to the company's foreign currency risk management program, as well as its interest rate risk management activities are discussed below.
foreign currency risk management the company has established revenue hedging, balance sheet risk management, and net investment hedging programs to protect against volatility of future foreign currency cash flows and changes in fair value caused by changes in foreign exchange rates.
the objective of the revenue hedging program is to reduce the variability caused by changes in foreign exchange rates that would affect the u.s. dollar value of future cash flows derived from foreign currency denominated sales, primarily the euro, japanese yen and chinese renminbi. to achieve this objective, the company will hedge a portion of its forecasted foreign currency denominated third-party and intercompany distributor entity sales (forecasted sales) that are expected to occur over its planning cycle, typically no more than two years into the future. the company will layer in hedges over time, increasing the portion of forecasted sales hedged as it gets closer to the expected date of the forecasted sales. the portion of forecasted sales hedged is based on assessments of cost-benefit profiles that consider natural offsetting exposures, revenue and exchange rate volatilities and correlations, and the cost of hedging instruments. the company manages its anticipated transaction exposure principally with purchased local currency put options, forward contracts, and purchased collar options.
the fair values of these derivative contracts are recorded as either assets (gain positions) or liabilities (loss positions) in the consolidated balance sheet. changes in the fair value of derivative contracts are recorded each period in either current earnings or other comprehensive income (loss) (oci), depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. for derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges, the unrealized gains or losses on these contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss (aocl) and reclassified into sales when the hedged anticipated revenue is recognized. for those derivatives which are not designated as cash flow hedges, but serve as economic hedges of forecasted sales, unrealized gains or losses are recorded in sales each period. the cash flows from both designated and non-designated contracts are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. the company does not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
because merck principally sells foreign currency in its revenue hedging program, a uniform weakening of the u.s. dollar would yield the largest overall potential loss in the market value of these hedge instruments. the market value of merck's hedges would have declined by an estimated $754 million and $647 million at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, from a uniform 10% weakening of the u.s. dollar. the market value was determined using a foreign exchange option pricing model and holding all factors except exchange rates constant. although not predictive in nature, the company believes that a 10% threshold reflects reasonably possible near-term changes in merck's major foreign currency exposures relative to the u.s. dollar.
the company manages operating activities and net asset positions at each local subsidiary in order to mitigate the effects of exchange on monetary assets and liabilities. monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of a given subsidiary are remeasured at spot rates in effect on the balance sheet date with the effects of changes in spot rates reported in other (income) expense, net. the company also uses a balance sheet risk management program to mitigate the exposure of such assets and liabilities from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange. merck principally utilizes forward exchange contracts to offset the effects of exchange on exposures when it is deemed economical to do so based on a cost-benefit analysis that considers the magnitude of the exposure, the volatility of the exchange rate and the cost of the hedging instrument (primarily the euro, swiss franc, japanese yen, and chinese renminbi). the forward contracts are not designated as hedges and are marked to market through other (income) expense, net. accordingly, fair value changes in the forward contracts table of contents help mitigate the changes in the value of the remeasured assets and liabilities attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, except to the extent of the spot-forward differences. these differences are not significant due to the short-term nature of the contracts, which typically have average maturities at inception of less than six months. the cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
a sensitivity analysis to changes in the value of the u.s. dollar on foreign currency denominated derivatives, investments and monetary assets and liabilities indicated that if the u.s. dollar uniformly weakened by 10% against all currency exposures of the company at december 31, 2023 and 2022, income from continuing operations before taxes would have declined by approximately $221 million and $190 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. because the company was in a net short (payable) position relative to its major foreign currencies after consideration of forward contracts, a uniform weakening of the u.s. dollar will yield the largest overall potential net loss in earnings due to exchange. this measurement assumes that a change in one foreign currency relative to the u.s. dollar would not affect other foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. although not predictive in nature, the company believes that a 10% threshold reflects reasonably possible near-term changes in merck's major foreign currency exposures relative to the u.s. dollar. the cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
the company also uses forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in foreign operations against movements in exchange rates. the forward contracts are designated as hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. the unrealized gains or losses on these contracts are recorded in foreign currency translation adjustment within oci and remain in aocl until either the sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of the subsidiary. the company excludes certain portions of the change in fair value of its derivative instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (excluded components). changes in fair value of the excluded components are recognized in oci. the company recognizes in earnings the initial value of the excluded components on a straight-line basis over the life of the derivative instrument, rather than using the mark-to-market approach. the cash flows from these contracts are reported as investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency debt. the company's senior unsecured euro-denominated notes have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment within oci.
interest rate risk management the company may use interest rate swap contracts on certain investing and borrowing transactions to manage its net exposure to interest rate changes and to reduce its overall cost of borrowing. the company does not use leveraged swaps and, in general, does not leverage any of its investment activities that would put principal at risk.
at december 31, 2023, the company was a party to four pay-floating, receive-fixed interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges of a portion of fixed-rate notes as detailed in the table below.
debt instrument                par value of debt                 number of interest rate swaps held                total swap notional amount the company's investment portfolio includes cash equivalents and short-term investments, the market values of which are not significantly affected by changes in interest rates. the market value of the company's medium- to long-term fixed-rate investments is modestly affected by changes in u.s. interest rates. changes in medium- to long-term u.s. interest rates have a more significant impact on the market value of the company's fixed-rate borrowings, which generally have longer maturities. a sensitivity analysis to measure potential changes in the market value of merck's investments and debt from a change in interest rates indicated that a one percentage point increase in interest rates at december 31, 2023 and 2022 would have positively affected the net aggregate market value of these instruments by $2.5 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. a one percentage point decrease at december 31, 2023 and 2022 would have negatively affected the net aggregate market value by $3.0 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. the fair value of merck's debt was determined using pricing models reflecting one percentage point shifts in the appropriate yield curves. the fair values of merck's investments were determined using a combination of pricing and duration models.
table of contents critical accounting estimates the company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap and, accordingly, include certain amounts that are based on management's best estimates and judgments. estimates are used when accounting for amounts recorded in connection with acquisitions, including initial fair value determinations of assets and liabilities in a business combination (primarily ipr&d, other intangible assets and contingent consideration), as well as subsequent fair value measurements. additionally, estimates are used in determining such items as provisions for sales discounts, rebates and returns, depreciable and amortizable lives, recoverability of inventories, including those produced in preparation for product launches, amounts recorded for contingencies, environmental liabilities, accruals for contingent sales-based milestone payments and other reserves, pension and other postretirement benefit plan assumptions, share-based compensation assumptions, restructuring costs, impairments of long-lived assets (including intangible assets and goodwill) and investments, and taxes on income. because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. application of the following accounting policies result in accounting estimates having the potential for the most significant impact on the financial statements.
acquisitions and dispositions to determine whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses, the company makes certain judgments, which include assessment of the inputs, processes, and outputs associated with the acquired set of activities. if the company determines that substantially all of the fair value of gross assets included in a transaction is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the assets would not represent a business. to be considered a business, the assets in a transaction need to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs.
in a business combination, the acquisition method of accounting requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded as of the date of the acquisition at their respective fair values with limited exceptions. the fair values of intangible assets are determined utilizing information available near the acquisition date based on expectations and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. given the considerable judgment involved in determining fair values, the company typically obtains assistance from third-party valuation specialists for significant items. assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies are generally recognized at fair value. if fair value cannot be determined, the asset or liability is recognized if probable and reasonably estimable; if these criteria are not met, no asset or liability is recognized. fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. accordingly, the company may be required to value assets at fair value measures that do not reflect the company's intended use of those assets. any excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred. the operating results of the acquired business are reflected in the company's consolidated financial statements after the date of the acquisition.
the judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, as well as asset lives, can materially affect the company's results of operations.
the fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to currently marketed products are primarily determined by using an income approach through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's discounted projected net cash flows. the company's estimates of market participant net cash flows consider historical and projected pricing, margins and expense levels; the performance of competing products where applicable; relevant industry and therapeutic area growth drivers and factors; current and expected trends in technology and product life cycles; the time and investment that will be required to develop products and technologies; the ability to obtain additional marketing and regulatory approvals; the ability to manufacture and commercialize the products; the extent and timing of potential new product introductions by the company's competitors; and the life of each asset's underlying patent and related patent term extension, if any. the net cash flows are then probability-adjusted where appropriate to consider the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized in the valuation. the probability-adjusted future net cash flows of each product are then discounted to present value utilizing an appropriate discount rate.
the fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to ipr&d are also determined using an income approach, through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's probability-adjusted future net cash flows, which reflect the different stages of development of each product and the associated probability of successful completion. the net cash flows are then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. amounts allocated to acquired ipr&d are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects. upon successful completion of each ipr&d table of contents project, merck will make a determination as to the then-useful life of the intangible asset, generally determined by the period in which the substantial majority of the cash flows are expected to be generated, and begin amortization.
certain of the company's business combinations involve the potential for future payment of consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of performance milestones, including product development milestones and royalty payments on future product sales. the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is determined at the acquisition date using unobservable inputs. these inputs include the estimated amount and timing of projected cash flows, the probability of success (achievement of the contingent event) and the risk-adjusted discount rate used to present value the probability-weighted cash flows. subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting period until the contingency is resolved, the contingent consideration liability is remeasured at current fair value with changes (either expense or income) recorded in earnings. changes in any of the inputs may result in a significantly different fair value adjustment.
if the company determines the transaction will not be accounted for as an acquisition of a business, the transaction will be accounted for as an asset acquisition rather than a business combination and, therefore, no goodwill will be recorded. in an asset acquisition, acquired ipr&d with no alternative future use is charged to expense and contingent consideration is not recognized at the acquisition date.
contingent sales-based milestones the terms of certain collaborative arrangements require the company to make payments contingent upon the achievement of sales-based milestones. sales-based milestones payable by merck to collaborative partners are accrued and capitalized, subject to cumulative amortization catch-up, when determined to be probable of being achieved by the company based on future sales forecasts. the amortization catch-up is calculated either from the time of the first regulatory approval for indications that were unapproved at the time the collaboration was formed, or from the time of the formation of the collaboration for approved products. the related intangible asset that is recognized is amortized over its remaining useful life, subject to impairment testing.
revenue recognition recognition of revenue requires evidence of a contract, probable collection of sales proceeds and completion of substantially all performance obligations. merck acts as the principal in substantially all of its customer arrangements and therefore records revenue on a gross basis. the majority of the company's contracts related to the pharmaceutical and animal health segments have a single performance obligation - the promise to transfer goods. shipping is considered immaterial in the context of the overall customer arrangement and damages or loss of goods in transit are rare. therefore, shipping is not deemed a separately recognized performance obligation.
the vast majority of revenues from sales of products are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which the company has determined is when title and risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the customer and the company is entitled to payment. for certain services in the animal health segment, revenue is recognized over time, generally ratably over the contract term as services are provided. these service revenues are not material.
the nature of the company's business gives rise to several types of variable consideration including discounts and returns, which are estimated at the time of sale generally using the expected value method, although the most likely amount method is used for prompt pay discounts.
in the u.s., sales discounts are issued to customers at the point-of-sale, through an intermediary wholesaler (known as chargebacks), or in the form of rebates. additionally, sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions. revenues are recorded net of provisions for sales discounts and returns, which are established at the time of sale. in addition, if collection of accounts receivable is expected to be in excess of one year, sales are recorded net of time value of money discounts, which have not been material.
the u.s. provision for aggregate customer discounts covers chargebacks and rebates. chargebacks are discounts that occur when a contracted customer purchases through an intermediary wholesaler. the wholesaler then charges the company back for the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contract price agreed to between merck and the customer. the provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through levels by the company's wholesale customers to contracted customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels. rebates are amounts owed based upon definitive contractual agreements or legal requirements with private sector and public sector (medicaid and medicare part d) benefit providers after the final dispensing of the product to a benefit plan participant. the provision for rebates is based on expected patient usage, as well as inventory levels in the distribution channel to determine the contractual obligation to the benefit providers. the company uses historical customer segment utilization mix, sales forecasts, changes to product mix and price, inventory levels in the distribution channel, government pricing calculations and prior payment history in order to estimate the expected table of contents provision. amounts accrued for aggregate customer discounts are evaluated on a quarterly basis through comparison of information provided by the wholesalers, health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, federal and state agencies, and other customers to the amounts accrued. merck remains committed to the 340b program and to providing 340b discounts to eligible covered entities. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding 340b legal proceedings.
summarized information about changes in the aggregate customer discount accrual related to u.s. sales is as follows:
adjustments to prior years              (70)                      (155)
outside of the u.s., variable consideration in the form of discounts and rebates are a combination of commercially-driven discounts in highly competitive product classes, discounts required to gain or maintain reimbursement, or legislatively mandated rebates. in certain european countries, legislatively mandated rebates are calculated based on an estimate of the government's total unbudgeted spending and the company's specific payback obligation. rebates may also be required based on specific product sales thresholds. the company applies an estimated factor against its actual invoiced sales to represent the expected level of future discount or rebate obligations associated with the sale.
the company maintains a returns policy that allows its u.s. pharmaceutical customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date (generally, three to six months before and 12 months after product expiration). the estimate of the provision for returns is based upon historical experience with actual returns. additionally, the company considers factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel, product dating and expiration period, whether products have been discontinued, entrance in the market of generic or other competition, changes in formularies or launch of over-the-counter products, among others. the product returns provision for u.s. pharmaceutical sales as a percentage of u.s. net pharmaceutical sales was 1.0% in 2023, 1.1% in 2022 and 0.9% in 2021. outside of the u.s., returns are only allowed in certain countries on a limited basis.
merck's payment terms for u.s. pharmaceutical customers are typically 36 days from receipt of invoice and for u.s. animal health customers are typically 30 days from receipt of invoice; however, certain products have longer payment terms, including keytruda, which has payment terms of 90 days. payment terms for vaccines sales in the u.s. typically range from 30 to 60 days. outside of the u.s., payment terms are typically 30 days to 90 days, although certain markets have longer payment terms.
through its distribution programs with u.s. wholesalers, the company encourages wholesalers to align purchases with underlying demand and maintain inventories below specified levels. the terms of the programs allow the wholesalers to earn fees upon providing visibility into their inventory levels, as well as by achieving certain performance parameters such as inventory management, customer service levels, reducing shortage claims and reducing product returns. information provided through the wholesaler distribution programs includes items such as sales trends, inventory on-hand, on-order quantity and product returns.
inventories produced in preparation for product launches the company capitalizes inventories produced in preparation for product launches sufficient to support estimated initial market demand. typically, capitalization of such inventory does not begin until regulatory approval is considered by the company to be probable. the company monitors the status of each respective product during the research and regulatory approval process. if the company is aware of any specific risks or contingencies other than the normal regulatory approval process or if there are any specific issues identified during the research process relating to safety, efficacy, manufacturing, marketing or labeling, the related inventory would generally not be capitalized. expiry dates of the inventory are affected by the stage of completion. the company manages the levels of inventory at each stage to optimize the shelf life of the inventory in relation to anticipated market demand in order to avoid product expiry issues. for inventories that are capitalized, anticipated future sales and shelf lives support the table of contents realization of the inventory value as the inventory shelf life is sufficient to meet initial product launch requirements. inventories produced in preparation for product launches capitalized at december 31, 2023 and 2022 were $790 million and $516 million, respectively.
contingencies and environmental liabilities the company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature considered normal to its business, including product liability, intellectual property and commercial litigation, as well as certain additional matters including governmental and environmental matters (see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements). the company records accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. these accruals are adjusted periodically as assessments change or additional information becomes available. for product liability claims, a portion of the overall accrual is actuarially determined and considers such factors as past experience, number of claims reported and estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported. individually significant contingent losses are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable.
legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable. some of the significant factors considered in the review of these legal defense reserves are as follows: the actual costs incurred by the company; the development of the company's legal defense strategy and structure in light of the scope of its litigation; the number of cases being brought against the company; the costs and outcomes of completed trials and the most current information regarding anticipated timing, progression, and related costs of pre-trial activities and trials in the associated litigation. the amount of legal defense reserves as of december 31, 2023 and 2022 of approximately $210 million and $230 million, respectively, represents the company's best estimate of the minimum amount of defense costs to be incurred in connection with its outstanding litigation; however, events such as additional trials and other events that could arise in the course of its litigation could affect the ultimate amount of legal defense costs to be incurred by the company. the company will continue to monitor its legal defense costs and review the adequacy of the associated reserves and may determine to increase the reserves at any time in the future if, based upon the factors set forth, it believes it would be appropriate to do so.
the company and its subsidiaries are parties to a number of proceedings brought under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act, commonly known as superfund, and other federal and state equivalents. when a legitimate claim for contribution is asserted, a liability is initially accrued based upon the estimated transaction costs to manage the site. accruals are adjusted as site investigations, feasibility studies and related cost assessments of remedial techniques are completed, and as the extent to which other potentially responsible parties who may be jointly and severally liable can be expected to contribute is determined.
the company is also remediating environmental contamination resulting from past industrial activity at certain of its sites and takes an active role in identifying and accruing for these costs. in the past, merck performed a worldwide survey to assess all sites for potential contamination resulting from past industrial activities. where assessment indicated that physical investigation was warranted, such investigation was performed, providing a better evaluation of the need for remedial action. where such need was identified, remedial action was then initiated. as definitive information became available during the course of investigations and/or remedial efforts at each site, estimates were refined and accruals were established or adjusted accordingly. these estimates and related accruals continue to be refined annually.
the company believes that there are no compliance issues associated with applicable environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on the company. expenditures for remediation and environmental liabilities were $6 million in 2023 and are estimated to be $27 million in the aggregate for the years 2024 through 2028. in management's opinion, the liabilities for all environmental matters that are probable and reasonably estimable have been accrued and totaled $42 million and $39 million at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. these liabilities are undiscounted, do not consider potential recoveries from other parties and will be paid out over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, which are expected to occur primarily over the next 15 years. although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these matters, or the ultimate costs of remediation, management does not believe that any reasonably possible expenditures that may be incurred in excess of the liabilities accrued should exceed approximately $40 million in the aggregate. management also does not believe that these expenditures should result in a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity for any year.
table of contents share-based compensation the company expenses all share-based payment awards to employees, including grants of stock options, over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards. the company determines the fair value of certain share-based awards using the black-scholes option-pricing model which uses both historical and current market data to estimate the fair value. this method incorporates various assumptions such as the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of the options. total pretax share-based compensation expense from continuing operations was $645 million in 2023, $541 million in 2022 and $479 million in 2021. at december 31, 2023, there was $990 million of total pretax unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock option, restricted stock unit and performance share unit awards which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years. for segment reporting, share-based compensation costs are unallocated expenses.
pensions and other postretirement benefit plans net periodic benefit cost for pension plans totaled $126 million in 2023, $554 million in 2022 and $748 million in 2021. net periodic benefit credit for other postretirement benefit plans was $61 million in 2023, $93 million in 2022 and $83 million in 2021. pension and other postretirement benefit plan information for financial reporting purposes is calculated using actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan benefit obligations and an expected rate of return on plan assets. the changes in net periodic benefit cost year over year for pension plans are primarily attributable to lower settlement charges incurred by certain plans in 2023 compared with 2022 and 2021, as well as changes in expected returns and the discount rates.
the company reassesses its benefit plan assumptions on a regular basis. for both the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the discount rate is evaluated on measurement dates and modified to reflect the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income debt instruments that would provide the future cash flows needed to pay the benefits included in the benefit obligation as they come due. the discount rates for the company's u.s. pension and other postretirement benefit plans ranged from 5.25% to 5.45% at december 31, 2023, compared with a range of 5.50% to 5.90% at december 31, 2022.
the expected rate of return for both the pension and other postretirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. in developing the expected rate of return, the company considers long-term compound annualized returns of historical market data, current market conditions and actual returns on the company's plan assets. using this reference information, the company develops forward-looking return expectations for each asset category and a weighted-average expected long-term rate of return for a target portfolio allocated across these investment categories. the expected portfolio performance reflects the contribution of active management as appropriate. for 2024, the expected rate of return for the company's u.s. pension and other postretirement benefit plans will be 7.75% compared with 7.00% in 2023.
the company has established investment guidelines for its u.s. pension and other postretirement plans to create an asset allocation that is expected to deliver a rate of return sufficient to meet the long-term obligation of each plan, given an acceptable level of risk. the target investment portfolio of the company's u.s. pension and other postretirement benefit plans is allocated 25% to 40% in u.s. equities, 10% to 20% in international equities, 35% to 45% in fixed-income investments, and up to 8% in cash and other investments. the portfolio's equity weighting is consistent with the long-term nature of the plans' benefit obligations. the expected annual standard deviation of returns of the target portfolio, which approximates 11%, reflects both the equity allocation and the diversification benefits among the asset classes in which the portfolio invests. for international pension plans, the targeted investment portfolio varies based on the duration of pension liabilities and local government rules and regulations. although a significant percentage of plan assets are invested in u.s. equities, concentration risk is mitigated through the use of strategies that are diversified within management guidelines.
actuarial assumptions are based upon management's best estimates and judgment. a reasonably possible change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have had an estimated $20 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the company's net periodic benefit cost in 2023. a reasonably possible change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the expected rate of return assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have had an estimated $55 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on merck's net periodic benefit cost in 2023. required funding obligations for 2024 relating to the company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans are not expected to be material. the preceding hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected rate of return assumptions would not impact the company's funding requirements.
net gain/loss amounts, which primarily reflect differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recorded as a component of aocl. expected returns for pension plans are based on a calculated market-related value of assets. net gain/loss amounts in aocl in table of contents excess of certain thresholds are amortized into net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service life of employees.
restructuring costs restructuring costs have been recorded in connection with restructuring program activities. as a result, the company has made estimates and judgments regarding its future plans, including future employee termination costs to be incurred in conjunction with involuntary separations when such separations are probable and estimable. when accruing termination costs, the company will recognize the amount within a range of costs that is the best estimate within the range. when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the company recognizes the minimum amount within the range. in connection with these actions, management also assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business. in certain instances, asset lives have been shortened based on changes in the expected useful lives of the affected assets. severance and employee-related costs, as well as other costs, such as facility shut-down costs, are reflected within restructuring costs. asset-related charges are reflected within cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses depending upon the nature of the asset.
impairments of long-lived assets the company assesses changes in economic, regulatory and legal conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the company's property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets.
the company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying values of its long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. if such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows of these assets, or appropriate asset groupings, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. if the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset's fair value and its carrying value. if quoted market prices are not available, the company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows approach.
goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. goodwill is assigned to reporting units and evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macroeconomic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows, the overall financial performance of the reporting unit, and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. if the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative fair value test is performed. if the carrying value of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the difference (up to the carrying value of goodwill).
other acquired intangible assets (excluding ipr&d) are initially recorded at fair value, assigned an estimated useful life, and amortized primarily on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. when events or circumstances warrant a review, the company will assess recoverability from future operations using pretax undiscounted cash flows derived from the lowest appropriate asset groupings. impairments are recognized in operating results to the extent that the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, which is determined based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows.
ipr&d that the company acquires in conjunction with a business combination represents the fair value assigned to incomplete research projects which, at the time of acquisition, have not reached technological feasibility. the amounts are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects. the company evaluates ipr&d for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist (such as unfavorable clinical trial data, changes in the commercial landscape or delays in the clinical development program and related regulatory filing and approval timelines), by performing a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the ipr&d intangible asset with its carrying value. for impairment testing purposes, the company may combine separately recorded ipr&d intangible assets into one unit of account based on the relevant facts and circumstances. generally, the company will combine ipr&d intangible assets for testing purposes if they operate as a single asset and are essentially inseparable. if the fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized in operating results.
the judgments made in evaluating impairment of long-lived intangibles can materially affect the company's results of operations.
table of contents taxes on income the company's effective tax rate is based on pretax income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates. an estimated effective tax rate for a year is applied to the company's quarterly operating results. in the event that there is a significant unusual or one-time item recognized, or expected to be recognized, in the company's quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or one-time item. the company considers the resolution of prior year tax matters to be such items. significant judgment is required in determining the company's tax provision and in evaluating its tax positions. the recognition and measurement of a tax position is based on management's best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. the company evaluates tax positions to determine whether the benefits of tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the company recognizes the amount of the benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. for tax positions that are not more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the company does not recognize any portion of the benefit in the financial statements. if the more likely than not threshold is not met in the period for which a tax position is taken, the company may subsequently recognize the benefit of that tax position if the tax matter is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires, or if the more likely than not threshold is met in a subsequent period (see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).
tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which the company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. the company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which the company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized as expense in the financial statements.

cautionary factors that may affect future results this report and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the company may contain so-called "forward-looking statements," all of which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause results to differ materially from those set forth in the statements. one can identify these forward-looking statements by their use of words such as "anticipates," "expects," "plans," "will," "estimates," "forecasts," "projects" and other words of similar meaning, or negative variations of any of the foregoing. one can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. these statements are likely to address the company's growth strategy, financial results, product approvals, product potential, development programs, environmental or other sustainability initiatives. one must carefully consider any such statement and should understand that many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company's forward-looking statements. these factors include inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety of other risks and uncertainties, including some that are known and some that are not. no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual future results may vary materially.
the company does not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. one should carefully evaluate such statements in light of factors, including risk factors, described in the company's filings with the securities and exchange commission, especially on this form 10-k and forms 10-q and 8-k. in item 1a. "risk factors" of this annual report on form 10-k the company discusses in more detail various important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results. the company notes these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. one should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. consequently, the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties.

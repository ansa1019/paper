since 2020, the life sciences solutions and specialty diagnostics segments as well as the laboratory products business have supported covid-19 diagnostic testing, scaling and evolving their molecular diagnostics solutions and plastic consumables businesses to respond to the covid-19 pandemic. the biosciences and bioproduction businesses have expanded their capacity to meet the needs of pharma and biotech customers as they have expanded their own production volumes to meet global vaccine manufacturing requirements. additionally, our pharma services business has provided our pharma and biotech customers with the services they needed to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally. since the company's acquisition of ppd in december 2021, the clinical research business has continued to play a leading role in supporting the clinical trials for covid-19 vaccines and therapies. these positive impacts continued at much lower levels in 2023 as customer testing as well as therapy and vaccine demand declined. sales of products related to covid-19 testing were $0.33 billion and $3.11 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
during 2023, growth from pharma and biotech customers slightly declined. over the past few years, the company has played a meaningful role in the production of covid-19 vaccines and therapies. in 2023, reduced demand for our products and services that support covid-19 vaccines and therapies was partially offset through strong commercial execution as a result of our trusted partner status with customers in this market. we saw broad based strength across the academic and government market as we saw the benefits of our accelerated investments into high impact innovation with great customer adoption and strong demand globally. the industrial and applied market was strong, driven by the relevance of our analytical instrument technologies serving our semiconductor and materials science customers. the diagnostics and healthcare market declined due to decreased demand for covid-19 testing products. during 2023, sales growth in all major regions declined due to decreased demand for covid-19 related products, as well as a challenging macroeconomic environment and low economic activity in china. contributions to organic revenue during 2023 from the analytical instruments and laboratory products and biopharma services segments were more than offset by declines in the life sciences solutions and specialty diagnostics segments.
the company continues to execute its proven growth strategy which consists of three pillars:
•high-impact innovation,
•our trusted partner status with customers, and gaap operating income margin and adjusted operating income margin decreased in 2023 due primarily to lower covid-19 related revenue. this was partially offset by strong productivity improvements and strong pricing realization to address higher inflation. gaap operating income margin in 2023 was also impacted by restructuring and other charges incurred for headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations and limit the impact of expected lower revenue (note 16). we estimate that restructuring actions resulting in charges of approximately $0.2 billion in 2023 will realize annual cost savings of approximately $0.5 billion, primarily due to reduced employee expenses.
the company's references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, research and development projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience, as well as incentive compensation and recognition for employees. the company's references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its practical process improvement (ppi) business system including reduced costs resulting from implementing continuous improvement methodologies, global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing.
notable recent acquisitions on january 3, 2023, the company acquired, within the specialty diagnostics segment, the binding site group, a u.k.-based provider of specialty diagnostic assays and instruments to improve the diagnosis and management of blood cancers and immune system disorders. the acquisition expands the segment's portfolio with the addition of pioneering innovation in diagnostics and monitoring for multiple myeloma.
on august 14, 2023, the company acquired, within the laboratory products and biopharma services segment, corevitas, llc, a u.s.-based provider of regulatory-grade, real-world evidence for approved medical treatments and therapies. the acquisition expands the segment's portfolio with the addition of highly complementary real-world evidence solutions to enhance decision-making as well as the time and cost of drug development.

*    results may not sum due to rounding non-operating items net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) increased due primarily to the increase in debt for general corporate purposes and the company's capital deployment initiatives, which included financing stock buybacks, paying dividends and acquiring the binding site group and corevitas, llc (note 2). these increases were partially offset by higher cash and cash equivalents balances as well as higher interest rates on these balances when compared to 2022. see additional discussion under the caption "liquidity and capital resources" below. in 2023 and 2022 the company's net interest expense was reduced by approximately $116 million and $16 million, respectively, as a result of its interest rate swap and cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements (note 14).
gaap other income/(expense) and adjusted other income/(expense) includes currency transaction gains/losses on non-operating monetary assets and liabilities, and net periodic pension benefit cost/income, excluding the service cost component. gaap other income/(expense) in 2023 also includes $45 million of net losses on investments. gaap other income/(expense) in 2022 also includes $160 million of net losses on investments and $26 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt (note 10), partially offset by $67 million of net gains on derivative instruments to address certain foreign currency risks.
the gaap and adjusted tax rates in 2023 were impacted by changes in valuation allowances, including a $183 million release in a jurisdiction where the deferred tax assets are now expected to be realized, and, to a lesser extent, by a decrease in pre-tax earnings compared to 2022. the company's gaap and adjusted tax rates in 2023 were also impacted by tax planning initiatives, including a tax benefit of $127 million for u.s. tax credits and the revaluation of net operating loss carryforwards due to higher tax rates as a result of its tax return resubmissions, a tax benefit of $91 million, net of related tax expenses, from a foreign exchange loss on an intercompany debt refinancing transaction, and $233 million of tax benefits resulting from intra-entity transactions. the company's gaap and adjusted tax rates in 2022 were impacted by releases of valuation allowances of $189 million in jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are now expected to be realized. the company's 2022 gaap tax rate was also impacted by a net benefit of $208 million resulting from tax audit settlements (note 8). the effective tax rates in both 2023 and 2022 were also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company's cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. see additional discussion under the caption "liquidity and capital resources" below.
the company expects its gaap effective tax rate in 2024 will be between 4% and 6% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. the effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events. the company expects its adjusted tax rate will be approximately 10.5% in 2024.
the company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 70 countries outside the u.s. some of these countries have lower tax rates than the u.s. the company's ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the u.s. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the u.s. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. based on the thermo fisher scientific inc.
dispersion of the company's non-u.s. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company's income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company's deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate.
weighted average diluted shares decreased in 2023 compared to 2022 due to share repurchases, net of option dilution.
liquidity and capital resources the company's proven growth strategy has enabled it to generate free cash flow as well as access the capital markets. the company deploys its capital primarily via mergers and acquisitions and secondarily via share buybacks and dividends.
approximately half of the company's cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the u.s. the company uses its non-u.s. cash for needs outside of the u.s. including acquisitions, capacity expansion, and repayment of third-party foreign debt by foreign subsidiaries. in addition, the company also transfers cash to the u.s. using non-taxable intercompany transactions, including loans and returns of capital, as well as dividends where the related u.s. dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax cost arising from the dividends. as a result of using such means of transferring cash to the u.s., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-u.s. cash balances for the foreseeable future.
the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.
as of december 31, 2023, the company's short-term debt totaled $3.61 billion. the company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $5.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit (note 10). if the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. as of december 31, 2023, no borrowings were outstanding under the company's revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by immaterial outstanding letters of credit.
net cash provided by operating activities                   $8,406                  $9,154
operating activities during 2023, cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. a decrease in inventories provided cash of $0.60 billion. a decrease in accounts payable used cash of $0.50 billion, and changes in other assets and other liabilities used cash of $0.80 billion primarily due to the timing of payments for compensation and income taxes. cash payments for income taxes were $1.48 billion during 2023.
during 2022, cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $0.43 billion and $0.83 billion, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. an increase in accounts payable provided cash of $0.65 billion. cash payments for income taxes were $1.23 billion during 2022.
the company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. an unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the heading "product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters" in note 12 could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows.
investing activities during 2023, acquisitions of the binding site group and corevitas, llc used cash of $2.70 billion and $0.91 billion, respectively. the company's investing activities also included purchases of $1.48 billion of property, plant and equipment for capacity and capability investments.
during 2022 the company's investing activities were principally for the purchase of property, plant and equipment for capacity and capability investments.
the company expects that for all of 2024, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion.
financing activities during 2023, issuance of senior notes provided $5.94 billion of cash. repayment of senior notes and net commercial paper activity used cash of $5.78 billion and $0.32 billion, respectively. the company's financing activities also included the repurchase of $3.00 billion of the company's common stock (5.2 million shares) and the payment of $0.52 billion in cash dividends. on november 14, 2023, the board of directors announced that it replaced the existing authorization to repurchase the company's common stock, of which $1.00 billion was remaining, with a new authorization to repurchase up to $4.00 billion of the company's common stock.
early in the first quarter of 2024, the company repurchased $3.00 billion (5.5 million shares) of the company's common stock. at february 22, 2024, $1.00 billion was available for future repurchases of the company's common stock under this authorization.
during 2022, issuance of senior notes provided $3.19 billion of cash. repayment of senior notes and net commercial paper activity used cash of $0.38 billion and $2.16 billion, respectively. the company's financing activities also included the repurchase of $3.00 billion of the company's common stock (5.3 million shares) and the payment of $0.46 billion in cash dividends.
in addition to the obligations on the balance sheet at december 31, 2023, which include, but are not limited to pension obligations (note 7), unrecognized tax benefits (note 8), debt (note 10), operating leases (note 11), and contingent consideration (note 14), the company has also entered into an agreement to acquire olink (note 2). the company also has unconditional purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business that include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets, pay royalties, and fund capital commitments pursuant to investments held by the company (note 12).
non-gaap measures in addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), we use certain non-gaap financial measures such as organic revenue growth, which is reported revenue growth, excluding the impacts of revenues from acquired/divested businesses and the effects of currency translation. we report organic revenue growth because thermo fisher management believes that in order to understand the company's short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of acquisitions/divestitures and foreign currency translation on revenues. thermo fisher management uses organic revenue growth to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the company as well as to compare revenues of current periods to prior periods.
we report adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted other income/(expense), adjusted tax rate, and adjusted eps. we believe that the use of these non-gaap financial measures, in addition to gaap financial measures, helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company's core operating performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods, forecasts, and to the performance of our competitors. such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. to calculate these measures we exclude, as applicable:
•certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, significant transaction/acquisition-related costs, including changes in estimates of contingent acquisition-related consideration, and other costs associated with obtaining short-term financing commitments for pending/recent acquisitions. we exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs.
•costs/income associated with restructuring activities and large-scale abandonments of product lines, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities. we exclude these costs because we believe that the costs related to restructuring activities and large-scale abandonment of product lines are not indicative of our normal operating costs.
•equity in earnings/losses of unconsolidated entities; impairments of long-lived assets; and certain other gains and losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, including gains/losses on thermo fisher scientific inc.
investments, the sale of businesses, product lines, and real estate, significant litigation-related matters, curtailments/settlements of pension plans, and the early retirement of debt. we exclude these items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods.
•the expense associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of up to 20 years. exclusion of the amortization expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies.
•the noncontrolling interest and tax impacts of the above items and the impact of significant tax audits or events (such as changes in deferred taxes from enacted tax rate/law changes), the latter of which we exclude because they are outside of our normal operations and difficult to forecast accurately for future periods.
we report free cash flow, which is operating cash flow excluding net capital expenditures, to provide a view of the continuing operations' ability to generate cash for use in acquisitions and other investing and financing activities. the company also uses this measure as an indication of the strength of the company. free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure.
the non-gaap financial measures of the company's results of operations and cash flows included in this form 10-k are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for the company's results of operations prepared in accordance with gaap. reconciliations of such non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures are set forth within the "consolidated results" and "segment results" sections and below.

critical accounting policies and estimates the company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. on an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to acquisition-related measurements and income taxes. management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. the results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements:
acquisition-related measurements business combinations the company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. the determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company's acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. the company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses, which include estimates of customer attrition and technology obsolescence rates. the projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. see note 2 for additional information about our recent business combinations.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets the company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of an asset below its carrying amount. events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts, among others. goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $44.02 billion and $1.24 billion, respectively, at december 31, 2023 (see note 1 for additional information). estimates of discounted future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth rates, discount rates and other factors. for the goodwill impairment tests, the company also considers (i) peer revenues and earnings trading multiples from companies that have operational and financial characteristics that are similar to the respective reporting units and (ii) estimated weighted average costs of capital. different assumptions from those made in the company's analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company's evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.
the company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test for all of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. determinations of fair value based on projections of discounted cash flows, which decreased from the prior year projections primarily due to higher discount rates, and based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples, which also decreased from the prior year, were sufficient to conclude that no impairments of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2023, the date of the company's annual impairment testing. there were no interim impairments of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2023. there can be no assurance, however, that adverse events or conditions will not cause the fair values of these assets to decline. should the fair values of the company's reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rates, charges for impairment may be necessary.
during its annual 2023 goodwill impairment assessments, the company determined that the excess of fair value over carrying value for one of the clinical research business's reporting units had increased to 4%. despite this favorable increase, given that the fair value of the reporting unit was not substantially in excess of its carrying value as of the annual 2023 assessment date, relatively small decreases in future cash flows versus anticipated results, decreases in peer trading multiples and/or increases in weighted average costs of capital could result in impairment of goodwill. the reporting unit had $3.95 billion of goodwill, and an overall carrying value of $5.54 billion as of december 31, 2023.
definite-lived intangible assets definite-lived intangible assets totaled $15.44 billion at december 31, 2023 (see note 1 for additional information). certain definite-lived intangible assets have largely independent cash flows. the company reviews these definite-lived intangible assets for impairment individually when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows, which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset. most of the company's definite-lived intangible assets are used in conjunction with other assets, such as property, plant and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets. in these situations, the company considers the asset groups to be the units of account for impairment testing. the company recorded definite-lived intangible asset impairments of $0.01 billion and $0.12 billion in 2023 and 2021, respectively (note 16).
income taxes unrecognized tax benefits in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company's income tax positions. the company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management's evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. the company's liability for these unrecognized tax benefits totaled $0.54 billion at december 31, 2023, compared to $0.57 billion at december 31, 2022, primarily as a result of an audit settlement (note 8).
the company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-u.s. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the company to interpret the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible thermo fisher scientific inc.
revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company's level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company's net income.
valuation allowances the company estimates the degree to which tax assets will result in a benefit, after consideration of all positive and negative evidence, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets that it believes will more likely than not go unused. in situations in which the company has been able to determine that its deferred tax assets will be realized, that determination generally relies on future reversals of taxable temporary differences and expected future taxable income. if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company's tax provision. the company's tax valuation allowance totaled $1.32 billion at both december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022 (note 8). should the company's actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary.

provision for income taxes the effective tax rate in fiscal 2023 and 2022 was 23.1% and 22.5%, respectively. the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an intercompany transfer of certain assets that resulted in a lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2022 and higher reserves for uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2023. refer to note 11, income taxes, within the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
adjusted provision for income taxes the adjusted effective tax rate in fiscal 2023 and 2022 was 23.1% and 22.5%, respectively. the drivers of the adjusted effective tax rate are the same as the drivers of the effective tax rate discussed above.

adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted eps reflect the changes in components described above.
diluted eps increased as a result of the increase in net earnings and the impact of fewer shares outstanding resulting from the repurchase of approximately 4.9 million shares during fiscal 2023 and 9.2 million shares during fiscal 2022, partially offset by the issuances of shares under our employee benefit plans.
for fiscal 2023, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted eps reflect the changes in components described above.

margin peo services' overall margin increased for fiscal 2023 due to increases in revenues discussed above, lower state unemployment and workers compensation insurance costs, and changes in our estimated losses related to adp indemnity, partially offset by increases in selling expenses.
adp indemnity provides workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for peo services' worksite employees up to $1 million per occurrence. peo services has secured a workers' compensation and employer's liability insurance policy that caps the exposure for each claim at $1 million per occurrence and has also secured aggregate stop loss insurance that caps aggregate losses at a certain level in fiscal years 2012 and prior from an admitted and licensed insurance company of aig. we utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability, and changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are included in the peo segment.
additionally, starting in fiscal year 2013, adp indemnity paid premiums to enter into reinsurance arrangements with ace american insurance company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of chubb limited ("chubb"), to cover substantially all losses incurred by the company up to the $1 million per occurrence related to the workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for peo services' worksite employees. each of these reinsurance arrangements limits our overall exposure incurred up to a certain limit. the company believes the likelihood of ultimate losses exceeding this limit is remote. during fiscal 2023, adp indemnity paid a premium of $284 million to enter into a reinsurance arrangement with chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity for the fiscal 2023 policy year up to $1 million per occurrence. adp indemnity recorded a pre-tax benefit of approximately $73 million in fiscal 2023 and a pre-tax benefit of approximately $61 million in fiscal 2022, which were primarily a result of changes in our estimated actuarial losses. adp indemnity paid a premium of $269 million in july 2023, to enter into a reinsurance agreement with chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity for fiscal 2024 policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2023 reinsurance policy.

(b) in fiscal 2023, the charges include consulting costs relating to our company-wide transformation initiatives, partially offset by net reversals relating to severance. unlike other severance charges which are not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results, these specific charges relate to actions taken as part of our broad-based, company-wide transformation initiatives.
(c) represents net charges (reserves and insurance recovery) from legal matters during fiscal 2023.
(d) the income tax (benefit)/provision was calculated based on the marginal rate in effect for the year ended june 30, 2023.
(e) the adjusted effective tax rate is calculated as our adjusted provision for income taxes divided by the sum of our adjusted net earnings plus our adjusted provision for income taxes.
the following table reconciles our reported growth rates to the non-gaap measure of organic constant currency, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, the impact of dispositions, and the impact of foreign currency. the impact of acquisitions and dispositions is calculated by excluding the current year revenues of acquisitions until the one-year anniversary of the transaction and by excluding the prior year revenues of divestitures for the one-year period preceding the transaction. the impact of foreign currency is determined by calculating the current year results using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year. the peo segment is not impacted by acquisitions, dispositions or foreign currency.

financial condition, liquidity and capital resources as of june 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were $2.1 billion, which were primarily invested in time deposits and money market funds.
for corporate liquidity, we expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term marketable securities, cash flow from operations together with our $9.7 billion of committed credit facilities and our ability to access both long-term and short-term debt financing from the capital markets will be adequate to meet our operating, investing, and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividends, share repurchases, and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. our financial condition remains solid at june 30, 2023 and we have sufficient liquidity.
for client funds liquidity, we have the ability to borrow through our financing arrangements under our u.s. short-term commercial paper program and our u.s., canadian and united kingdom short-term reverse repurchase agreements, together with our $9.7 billion of committed credit facilities and our ability to use corporate liquidity when necessary to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. please see "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" for a further discussion of the risks related to our client funds extended investment strategy. see note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our short-term financing including commercial paper.
operating, investing and financing cash flows our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the statements of consolidated cash flows are summarized as follows:
2023                          2022                                                 $ change cash provided by (used in):

net change in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents                                       $(14,011.5)                          $9,639.8                   $(23,651.3)
net cash flows provided by operating activities increased due to growth in our underlying business (net income adjusted for non-cash adjustments), and a net favorable change in the components of operating assets and liabilities primarily due to timing on collections of accounts receivable, and a decrease in incentive compensation payments, as compared to the year ended june 30, 2022.
net cash flows used in investing activities changed due to the timing of proceeds and purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities of $4,570.2 million, offset by higher payments for capital expenditures in fiscal 2023, and the sale of property, plant, and equipment in fiscal 2022.
net cash flows used in financing activities changed due to a net decrease in the cash flow from client funds obligations of $29,759.5 million, which is due to the timing of impounds from our clients and payments to our clients' employees and other payees, an increase in dividends paid, and a net decrease in reverse repurchase agreements borrowing, offset by a decrease in repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2023.
we purchased approximately 4.9 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $227.30 during fiscal 2023, as compared to purchases of 9.2 million shares at an average price per share of $214.40 during fiscal 2022. from time to time, the company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program. the company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.
capital resources and client fund obligations we have $3.0 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturity dates in 2025, 2028, and 2030. we may from time to time revisit the long-term debt market to refinance existing debt, finance investments including acquisitions for our growth, and maintain the appropriate capital structure. however, there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all. see note 9 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our notes.
our u.s. short-term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. this commercial paper program provides for the issuance of up to $9.7 billion in aggregate maturity value. our commercial paper program is rated a-1+ by standard and poor's, prime-1 ("p-1") by moody's and f1+ by fitch. these ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days. at june 30, 2023 and 2022, we had no commercial paper borrowing outstanding. details of the borrowings under the commercial paper program are as follows:
weighted average maturity (approximately in days)                       2 days                  1 day our u.s., canadian, and united kingdom short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. these agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days. we have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as-needed basis to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. at june 30, 2023 and 2022, there were $105.4 million and $136.4 million, respectively, of outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements. details of the reverse repurchase agreements are as follows:
we vary the maturities of our committed credit facilities to limit the refinancing risk of any one facility. we have a $4.25 billion, 364-day credit agreement that matures in june 2024 with a one year term-out option. in addition, we have a five-year $3.2 billion credit facility and a five-year $2.25 billion credit facility maturing in june 2026 and june 2028, respectively, each with an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. the primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary. we had no borrowings through june 30, 2023 under the credit facilities. we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreements to borrow thereunder, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $9.7 billion available to us under the revolving credit agreements. see note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our short-term financing including credit facilities.
our investment portfolio does not contain any asset-backed securities with underlying collateral of sub-prime mortgages, alternative-a mortgages, sub-prime auto loans or sub-prime home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non-investment grade fixed-income securities. we own aaa-rated senior tranches of primarily fixed rate auto loan, credit card, and equipment lease receivables, secured predominantly by prime collateral. all collateral on asset-backed securities is performing as expected through june 30, 2023. in addition, we own u.s. government securities which primarily include debt directly issued by federal farm credit banks and federal home loan banks. our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). this investment strategy is supported by our short-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations. see note 4 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our corporate investments and funds held for clients.
capital expenditures for fiscal 2023 were $206.0 million, as compared to $177.1 million for fiscal 2022. we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2024 to be between $200 million and $225 million.
contractual obligations our contractual obligations at june 30, 2023 relate primarily to operating leases (note 6) and other arrangements recorded in our balance sheet or disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, including benefit plan obligations (note 10), liabilities for uncertain tax positions (note 11), purchase obligations (note 12), debt obligations (note 9) and $263.5 million of interest payments of our debt, of which $64.3 million is expected to be paid within one year.
in addition to the obligations described above, we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services. as of june 30, 2023, the obligations relating to these matters, which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2024, total $38,538.6 million and were recorded in client funds obligations on our consolidated balance sheets. we had $36,333.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities that were impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our consolidated balance sheets as of june 30, 2023.
separately, adp indemnity paid a premium of $269 million in july 2023 to enter into a reinsurance agreement with chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity for the fiscal 2024 policy year. at june 30, 2023, adp indemnity had total assets of $660.8 million to satisfy the actuarially estimated unpaid losses of $552.3 million for the policy years since july 1, 2003. adp indemnity paid claims of $0.8 million and $1.8 million, net of insurance recoveries, in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. refer to the "analysis of reportable segments - peo services" above for additional information regarding adp indemnity.
in the normal course of business, we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our services and products. we do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties.
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments (cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term marketable securities) and client funds assets (funds that have been collected from clients but have not yet been remitted to the applicable tax authorities, client employees or other payees).
our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities. these assets are available for our regular quarterly dividends, share repurchases, capital expenditures and/or acquisitions, as well as other corporate operating purposes. all of our short-term and long-term fixed-income securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.
our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary objectives. consistent with those objectives, we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income.  client funds assets are invested in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase, and money market securities and other cash equivalents.
we utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short-term financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). as part of our client funds investment strategy, we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. in circumstances where we experience a reduction in employment levels due to a slowdown in the economy, we may make tactical decisions to sell certain securities in order to reduce the size of the funds held for clients to correspond to client funds obligations. we attempt to minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client's obligation becomes due by generally impounding the client's funds by the time we pay such client's obligation. when we don't impound client funds in advance of paying such client obligations, we are at risk of not recovering such funds or a material delay in such recovery. through our clients funds investment strategy and client impounding processes, we have consistently maintained the required level of liquidity to satisfy all of our obligations.
there are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets. such risks include liquidity risk, including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate, if necessary, our available-for-sale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations. however, our investments are made with the safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations. we also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity, including our corporate cash balances, available borrowings under our $9.7 billion commercial paper program (rated a-1+ by standard and poor's, p-1 by moody's, and f1+ by fitch, the highest possible short-term credit ratings), our ability to engage in reverse repurchase agreement transactions and available borrowings under our $9.7 billion committed credit facilities. the reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our ability to access short-term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business. in addition to liquidity risk, our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk, as discussed below.
we have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments. the minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate, canadian government agency and canadian provincial bonds is bbb, for asset-backed securities is aaa, and for municipal bonds is a. the maximum maturity at time of purchase for bbb-rated securities is 5 years, and for single a rated, aa-rated and aaa-rated securities it is 10 years. time deposits and commercial paper must be rated a-1 and/or p-1. money market funds must be rated aaa/aaa-mf.
average interest rates earned exclusive of realized losses/(gains) on:
as of june 30:
we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature, as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested. factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short-term and long-term investments. this mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes. the annualized interest rate earned on our entire portfolio increased from 1.3% for fiscal 2022 to 2.4% for fiscal 2023. a hypothetical change in both short-term interest rates (e.g., overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate) and intermediate-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately an $14 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending june 30, 2024. a hypothetical change in only short-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average short-term investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately an $5 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending june 30, 2024.
we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities. we limit credit risk by investing in investment-grade securities, primarily aaa-rated and aa- rated securities, as rated by moody's, standard & poor's, dbrs for canadian dollar denominated securities, and fitch for asset-backed and commercial-mortgage-backed securities. in addition, we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than u.s. government and government agency, canadian government, and united kingdom government securities.
we operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. we may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes.
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note 1, recently issued accounting pronouncements, of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and other comprehensive income. we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies for additional information.
the estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. these estimates require levels of subjectivity and judgment, which could result in actual results differing from our estimates. the company believes the following are its critical accounting estimates:
deferred costs - assets recognized from the costs to obtain and fulfill contracts description incremental costs of obtaining a contract (e.g., sales commissions) and cost incurred to implement clients on our solutions (e.g., direct labor) that are expected to be recovered are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the client retention period, depending on the business unit.
judgments and uncertainties the company has estimated the amortization periods for deferred costs by using its historical retention rates by business unit to estimate the pattern during which the service transfers. the expected client relationship period ranges from three to eight years.
sensitivity of estimate to change as the assumptions used to estimate the amortization period of the deferred costs could have a material impact on timing of recognition, we assess the amortization periods annually using historical retention rates. actual retention rates were not materially different than those used in our calculation to determine the amortization period. we regularly review our deferred costs for impairment. there were no impairment losses incurred during the fiscal years ended june 30, 2023, june 30, 2022, or june 30, 2021.
description goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill might be impaired.
judgments and uncertainties the company's annual goodwill impairment assessment as of june 30, 2023 was performed for all reporting units using a quantitative approach by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. we estimated the fair value of each reporting unit using, as appropriate, the income approach, which is derived using the present value of future cash flows discounted at a risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, and the market approach, which is based upon using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business. significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of our reporting units include projected revenue growth rates, profitability projections, working capital assumptions, the weighted average cost of capital, the determination of appropriate market comparison companies, and terminal growth rates. several of these assumptions including projected revenue growth rates and profitability projections are dependent on our ability to upgrade, enhance, and expand our technology and services to meet client needs and preferences.
sensitivity of estimate to change some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair value of the reporting units are outside the control of management including the weighted-average cost of capital, tax rates, market comparisons, and terminal growth rates. while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur. if our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value, it could result in material impairments of our goodwill. the assumptions used to assess impairment consider historical trends, macroeconomic conditions, and projections consistent with the company's operating strategy. changes in these estimates can have a significant impact on the assessment of fair value which could result in material impairment losses.
we completed our annual assessment of goodwill as of june 30, 2023 and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill. we performed a sensitivity analysis and determined that a one percentage point increase in the weighted-average cost of capital would not result in an impairment of goodwill for all reporting units and their fair values substantially exceeded their carrying values.
income taxes description judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
judgments and uncertainties the company computes its provision for income taxes based on the statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. assumptions, judgment, and the use of estimates are required in determining if the "more likely than not" standard has been met when computing the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions.
sensitivity of estimate to change while the company considers all of its tax positions fully supportable, the company is occasionally challenged by various tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. if certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions. as of june 30, 2023 and 2022, the company's liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were $116.9 million and $98.1 million, respectively.

item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this 2020 form 10-k to enhance the understanding of our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
the comparison of 2019 to 2018 results has been omitted from this form 10-k, but can be referenced in our form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019-"item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" filed on february 24, 2020.
executive summary bristol-myers squibb company is a global biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases. refer to the summary of abbreviated terms at the end of this 2020 form 10-k for terms used throughout the document.
we completed the celgene transaction on november 20, 2019. our consolidated financial statements for 2020 include a full year of celgene operations. on november 17, 2020, we completed our acquisition of myokardia for approximately $13.1 billion in cash. we expect that our acquisitions of celgene and myokardia will further position us as a leading biopharmaceutical company, expanding our oncology, hematology, immunology and cardiovascular portfolios with several near-term assets and additional external partnerships. refer to "-acquisitions, divestitures, licensing and other arrangements" for further information.
the covid-19 pandemic is resulting in significant risks and disruptions to the health and welfare of the global population and economy. although the pandemic has not had a significant impact on our results of operations, it remains difficult to reasonably assess or predict the full extent of the negative impact that the covid-19 pandemic may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the impact will depend on future developments such as the ultimate duration and recovery from the pandemic, government actions, impact on the u.s. and global economies, customer behavior changes and timing for resumption to our normal operations, among others. refer to "-economic and market factors" for further information.
in 2020, we received 13 approvals for new medicines and additional indications and formulations of currently marketed medicines in major markets (the u.s., eu and japan), including multiple regulatory milestone achievements for opdivo and opdivo+yervoy combinations and have over 50 unique compounds in clinical development. we are investigating opdivo alone and in combination with yervoy and other anti-cancer agents for a wide array of tumor types. we continue to expand in the field of hematology, where we have the leading presence, through in-line assets revlimid and pomalyst. in 2020, we received regulatory approvals for zeposia and onureg and received ema validation for liso-cel for the treatment of large b-cell lymphoma. additionally, our pipeline shows significant added promise in hematology malignancies through our celmod agents (iberdomide and cc-92480), multiple modalities targeting b-cell maturation antigen ("bcma") and the next generation of cell therapy agents. we are expanding our portfolio in immunology with a near term launch opportunity for deucravacitinib, our tyk2 inhibitor. additionally in the cardiovascular space, eliquis is a leading oral anti-coagulant drug, and we continue to experience growth in both the eliquis brand and market while also advancing our factor xia inhibitor program. with the acquisition of myokardia, we bolstered our leading cardiovascular franchise and added exceptional scientific capabilities, mavacamten a potentially transformative new medicine with significant commercial potential and a promising pipeline of candidates.
in 2020, our revenues increased 63% as a result of the celgene acquisition, which contributed $15.7 billion of revenues or 60% of the growth, and higher demand for eliquis. the gaap loss per share of $3.99 in 2020 as compared to the gaap eps of $2.01 in 2019 was primarily due to the iprd charge resulting from the myokardia asset acquisition and charges relating to the celgene acquisition including (i) amortization of acquired intangible assets, (ii) the unwinding of inventory fair value adjustments and (iii) tax charges resulting from an internal transfer of certain intangible assets and the otezla* divestiture, partially offset by higher revenues and fair value adjustments to contingent value rights and equity investments. after adjusting for specified items, non-gaap eps increased $1.75 as result of the celgene acquisition.
highlights the following table summarizes our financial information:
our non-gaap financial measures, including non-gaap earnings and related eps information, are adjusted to exclude specified items that represent certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other items impacting the comparability of financial results. for a detailed listing of all specified items and further information and reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures refer to "-non-gaap financial measures."
economic and market factors covid-19
the covid-19 pandemic continues to affect global healthcare systems as well as major economic and financial markets. virtually all industries are facing challenges associated with the economic conditions resulting from efforts to address this pandemic. for example, many entities in certain industries have seen sharp declines in revenues due to regulatory and organizational mandates (e.g., "shelter in place" mandates, non-essential business and school closures) and voluntary changes in consumer behavior (e.g., "physical distancing"). many entities continue to experience conditions often associated with a sudden and severe economic downturn. such conditions may include financial market volatility, erosion of market value, deteriorating credit, liquidity concerns, further increases in government intervention, increasing unemployment, broad declines in consumer discretionary spending, increasing inventory levels, reductions in production because of decreased demand and supply constraints, layoffs and furloughs and other restructuring activities.
we continue to monitor the impact on our business resulting from wider restrictions in select states and non-u.s. countries. this is a dynamically changing environment and we continue to react to outbreaks throughout the world by re-enforcing our directives to keep our workforce safe in order to provide our patients with life-sustaining medicines. continued escalating infection rates could negatively affect our planned recovery, pressuring demand from less patient visits and channel mix if unemployment data trends remain unfavorable.
we have not incurred and do not anticipate disruptions to the supply of our medicines for patients due to the covid-19 pandemic. however, we are experiencing scarcity of certain raw materials and components as a result of the influx of covid-19 vaccine orders receiving priority treatment from vendors. all of our internal manufacturing facilities and key contract manufacturers are operating with proper measures taken to help ensure employee safety. we have increased the number of our lab workers where it is safe to do so. we have implemented a number of measures to protect the health and safety of our workforce, including, where needed, a mandatory work-from-home policy for our global workforce who can perform their jobs from home as well as restrictions on business travel, and workplace and in-person meetings. depending on local conditions, field-based personnel began in-person customer interactions in healthcare settings where it is safe to do so and approved by the government. the remote engagement model has continued to support healthcare professionals, patient care and access to our medicines. although certain field-based sales teams have begun in person engagement in selected states and non-u.s. regions, the majority of interactions remain remote.
the situation remains dynamic and challenging to assess the potential impact on our operations such as the ability and willingness of patients to access treatment centers or obtain a prescription and changes in prescribing patterns that may potentially affect our operations in the long-term. certain changes in buying patterns have occurred, including payers implementing policies to encourage larger prescription sizes and earlier refills to help patients avoid trips to the pharmacy. however, fewer patient office visits are resulting in lower than previously expected new patient starts. although it is difficult to estimate the impact of these factors, we do not believe that they had a significant impact on our revenues during 2020.
the timing of specific product launches depends on the relevant facts and circumstances for each situation. for example, we delayed the commercialization of zeposia in the u.s. based on the best health interest of our patients, customers and workforce. in contrast, reblozyl was available for mds patients following its approval for this additional indication in april 2020 and onureg was available for patients with aml in september 2020. our expanded u.s. patient assistance programs provided certain covered bms medicines free to eligible patients that lost employment and health insurance due to covid-19. it is uncertain what the aggregate impact of the above factors and potential changes in channel mix will have on our revenues and expenses during 2021.
we restarted clinical development activities after pausing the opening of additional sites during the first months of the onset of the covid-19 pandemic. however, we experienced a slight slowdown of our clinical studies again in the fourth quarter. in addition, certain delays have occurred due to slower enrollment. patient enrollment for certain new clinical studies and ongoing studies at new sites are carefully being started when the safety of study participants, our employees and staff at clinical trial sites, regulatory compliance and scientific integrity of trial data can be assured. we expect many new studies to start through the first quarter of 2021 following the completion of feasibility assessments, rigorous planning and selected protocol simplifications. previously suspended research and early development activities performed in laboratories recommenced in all major sites in the u.s. although close monitoring of the situation continues.
the covid-19 pandemic has increased the volatility of the financial markets, foreign currency exchanges and interest rates. although we incurred downward adjustments to our equity investment fair values in the first quarter of 2020, the fair values have subsequently recovered. lower interest rates and changes of the u.s. dollar relative to foreign currencies have not had a material impact to our operations. the carrying value of our intangible assets was approximately $53 billion at december 31, 2020. significant charges might occur in future periods due to a decline in previously expected cash flows as a direct or indirect result of the pandemic. this may occur due to delays in the enrollment or timely completion of clinical programs, fda site inspections and other interactions with regulatory bodies in general, regulatory approvals, launches of newly approved products or lower demand in general. see risk factor on the company's risk factors resulting from the covid-19 pandemic included under "part i-item 1a. risk factors-the covid-19 pandemic is affecting our business and could have a material adverse effect on us."
governmental actions additional regulations in the u.s. may occur in the future, including healthcare reform initiatives, further changes to tax laws and pricing laws and potential importation restrictions, that may reduce our results of operations, operating cash flow, liquidity and financial flexibility. for example, in november 2020 the u.s. federal government issued regulations regarding u.s. drug prices and payment for pharmaceutical products, including regulations that: (1) would reduce physician reimbursement for certain medicare part b drugs administered in doctors' offices or hospitals to a "most favored nation price" drawn from the lowest price paid by certain countries in the organisation for economic co-operation and development, which would apply to many cancer medications; (2) would authorize states and private parties to develop and implement programs to import certain prescription drugs from canada and sell them in the u.s.; and (3) would reform the use of rebates in medicare part d. the outcome of these regulations remains uncertain as a result of ongoing litigation and other factors. see risk factor on the company's risk factors on the executive orders included under "part i-item 1a. risk factors-increased pricing pressure and other restrictions in the u.s. and abroad continue to negatively affect our revenues and profit margins."
we continue to monitor the potential impact of the economic conditions in certain european and other countries and the related impact on prescription trends, pricing discounts and creditworthiness of our customers. we believe these economic conditions will not have a material impact on our liquidity, cash flow or financial flexibility.
the uk departed from the eu on january 31, 2020. the departure began a transition period that ended on december 31, 2020 with a signature of a trade and cooperation agreement between the uk and the eu. similar to other companies in our industry, certain regulatory, trade, labor and other aspects of our business have been affected during the transition period and will over time. these matters and other related financial effects did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. our sales in the uk represent less than 3% of our total revenues. see "item 1a. risk factors-adverse changes in u.s. and global economic and political conditions could adversely affect our profitability" for more information on the impact on the company of the exit of the uk from the eu.

strategy our principal strategy is to combine the resources, scale and capability of a pharmaceutical company with the speed and focus on innovation of the biotech industry. our focus as a biopharmaceutical company is on discovering, developing and delivering transformational medicines for patients facing serious diseases in areas where we believe that we have an opportunity to make a meaningful difference: oncology (both solid tumors and hematology), immunology, cardiovascular and fibrosis. our four strategic priorities are to drive enterprise performance, maximize the value of our commercial portfolio, ensure the long-term sustainability of our pipeline through combined internal and external innovation and establish our new culture and embed our people strategy.
we are developing new medicines in the following core therapeutic areas: (i) oncology with a priority in certain tumor types; (ii) hematology with opportunities to broaden our franchise and potentially sustain a leadership position in multiple myeloma; (iii) immunology with priorities in relapsing multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, lupus, ra and inflammatory bowel disease; (iv) cardiovascular disease and; (v) fibrotic disease with priorities in lung and liver. we continue to advance the next wave of innovative medicines by investing significantly in our pipeline both internally and through business development activities. we have expanded our oncology, hematology and immunology portfolios with several near-term assets and additional external partnerships. we have invested in our oncology portfolio by pursuing both monotherapy and combination approaches and advancing our next wave of early assets and to explore new collaboration opportunities across our therapeutic areas of focus. we remain focused and well-resourced in our cancer development programs and seek to broaden the use of opdivo in earlier lines of therapy, expand into new tumors, accelerate next wave oncology mechanisms and develop treatment options for refractory oncology patients. for hematology, we have opportunities to launch several new medicines in the near-term with additional pipeline opportunities in the longer term. there is a broad effort to continue to address the unmet medical need in multiple myeloma and we are working across multiple modalities and mechanisms of action such as cereblon modulator ("celmod"), t-cell engager and car t-cell therapy. beyond cancer, we continue to advance our early stage portfolio in immunology, cardiovascular and fibrotic diseases and strengthen our partnerships with a diverse group of companies and academic institutions in new and expanded research activities. we believe our differentiated internal and external focus contributes to the advancing of our pipeline of potentially transformational medicines.
our commercial model has been successful with revenues from our prioritized brands continuing to grow, which demonstrates strong execution of our strategy. we continue to drive adoption of opdivo by expanding into additional indications and tumor types both as a monotherapy and in combination with yervoy and other anti-cancer agents. eliquis continues to grow, leveraging its best in class clinical profile and extensive real world data and is now the number one novel oral anticoagulant in total prescriptions globally. revlimid and pomalyst have transformed the treatment of multiple myeloma, where we have a leading presence, and we continue to seek opportunities to leverage the significant medical and commercial expertise to address areas of high unmet medical need. we are building on the continued success of our other prioritized brands and remain strongly committed to orencia and sprycel. we are also optimistic on the future growth and near-term opportunities of reblozyl, a first-in-class medicine, inrebic, zeposia and onureg. through our operating model transformation, our commercial infrastructure is leveraged for potential growth.
our operating model continues to evolve and we have been successful in focusing commercial, r&d and manufacturing resources on prioritized brands and markets, strengthening our r&d capabilities in tumor biology, patient selection and new biomarkers, delivering leaner administrative functions and streamlining our manufacturing network to reflect the importance of biologics in our current and future portfolio. the evolution in our operating model, which focuses on maintaining a disciplined approach in marketing, selling and administrative expenses, will enable us to deliver the necessary strategic, financial and operational flexibility to invest in the highest priority opportunities within our portfolio. we will continue to make progress towards integrating the companies on the commercial and research and development area. through our celgene acquisition restructuring activities, we expect to realize $3.0 billion of synergies resulting from cost savings and avoidance through 2022 and our integration efforts across general and administrative, manufacturing, r&d, procurement and streamlining the company's pricing and information technology infrastructure.
looking ahead, we will continue to implement our biopharma strategy by driving the growth of prioritized brands, executing product launches, investing in our diverse and innovative pipeline, aided by strategic business development, focusing on prioritized markets, increasing investments in our biologics manufacturing capabilities and maintaining a culture of continuous improvement.

estimated end-user demand pursuant to the sec consent order described under "-sec consent order", we monitor the level of inventory on hand in the u.s. wholesaler distribution channel and outside of the u.s. in the direct customer distribution channel. we are obligated to disclose products with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception. estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel in excess of one month on hand for the following products were not material to our results of operations as of the dates indicated.
onureg had 1.5 months of inventory on hand at december 31, 2020 in the u.s. to support the product launch. the inventory is expected to be worked down as demand increases post launch.
zeposia had 2.2 months of inventory on hand internationally in the distribution channel at september 30, 2020 to support the product launch in germany. the inventory is expected to be worked down as demand increases post launch.
in the u.s., we generally determine our months on hand estimates using inventory levels of product on hand and the amount of out-movement provided by our three largest wholesalers, which account for approximately 75% of total gross sales of u.s. products for the year ended december 31, 2020. factors that may influence our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, wholesaler purchases in light of increases in wholesaler list prices, new product launches, new warehouse openings by wholesalers and new customer stockings by wholesalers. in addition, these estimates are calculated using third-party data, which may be impacted by their recordkeeping processes.
revlimid and pomalyst are distributed in the u.s. primarily through contracted pharmacies under the revlimid rems and pomalyst rems programs, respectively. these are proprietary risk-management distribution programs tailored specifically to provide for the safe and appropriate distribution and use of revlimid and pomalyst. internationally, revlimid and imnovid are distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution programs tailored to meet local authorities' specifications to provide for the products' safe and appropriate distribution and use. these programs may vary by country and, depending upon the country and the design of the risk-management program, the product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies.
our non-u.s. businesses have significantly more direct customers. information on available direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information varies widely. we limit our direct customer sales channel inventory reporting to where we can influence demand. when this information does not exist or is otherwise not available, we have developed a variety of methodologies to estimate such data, including using historical sales made to direct customers and third-party market research data related to prescription trends and end-user demand. given the difficulties inherent in estimating third-party demand information, we evaluate our methodologies to estimate direct customer product level inventory and to calculate months on hand on an ongoing basis and make changes as necessary. factors that may affect our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, price increases, new product launches, new warehouse openings by direct customers, new customer stockings by direct customers and expected direct customer purchases for governmental bidding situations. as such, all of the information required to estimate months on hand in the direct customer distribution channel for non-u.s. business for the year ended december 31, 2020 is not available prior to the filing of this 2020 form 10-k. we will disclose any product with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception, in the next quarterly report on form 10-q.

cost of products sold cost of products sold include material, internal labor and overhead costs from our owned manufacturing sites, third-party product supply costs and other supply chain costs managed by our global manufacturing and supply organization. cost of products sold also includes royalties and profit sharing, certain excise taxes, foreign currency hedge settlement gains and losses and impairment charges. cost of products sold typically vary between periods as a result of product mix and volume (particularly royalties and profit sharing), and to a lesser extent changes in foreign currency, price, inflation, costs attributed to manufacturing site exits and impairment charges. cost of products sold excludes amortization from acquired intangible assets.
•cost of products sold increased by $3.7 billion in 2020, primarily due to unwinding of inventory fair value adjustments ($2.0 billion), higher royalties and eliquis profit sharing ($650 million), higher celgene product costs (approximately $600 million) and an impairment charge related to inrebic marketed product rights ($575 million).
marketing, selling and administrative marketing, selling and administrative expenses primarily include salary and benefit costs, third-party professional and marketing fees, outsourcing fees, shipping and handling costs, advertising and product promotion costs. expenses are managed through regional commercialization organizations or global enabling functions such as finance, legal, information technology and human resources. certain expenses are shared with alliance partners based upon contractual agreements.
•marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased by $2.8 billion in 2020, primarily due to costs associated with the broader portfolio resulting from the celgene acquisition (approximately $2.0 billion), higher advertising and promotion expenses and a cash settlement of myokardia unvested stock awards ($241 million).
research and development research and development activities include discovery research, preclinical and clinical development, drug formulation and medical support of marketed products. expenses include salary and benefit costs, third-party grants and fees paid to clinical research organizations, supplies, upfront and contingent milestone payments for licensing and asset acquisitions of investigational compounds, iprd impairment charges and proportionate allocations of enterprise-wide costs. the allocations include facilities, information technology, employee stock compensation costs and other appropriate costs. certain expenses are shared with alliance partners based upon contractual agreements. expenses typically vary between periods for a number of reasons, including the timing of license and asset acquisition charges and iprd impairment charges.
•research and development expense increased by $5.0 billion in 2020, primarily due to costs associated with the broader portfolio resulting from the celgene acquisition (approximately $3.3 billion, excluding bluebird and dragonfly charges), license and asset acquisition charges of $1.0 billion relating to dragonfly, bluebird, forbius, cormorant and nektar, an iprd impairment charge resulting from the decision to discontinue further development of the orva-cel program ($470 million) and a cash settlement of myokardia unvested stock awards ($241 million).
iprd charge - myokardia acquisition iprd charges represents the costs of iprd assets acquired in a transaction other than a business combination.
•the myokardia acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition because substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (excluding cash and deferred taxes) was allocated to a single asset, mavacamten. the iprd charge related to the myokardia transaction is presented separately due to the significance of the charge.
amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of intangible assets acquired as a result of business combinations.
•amortization of acquired intangible assets increased by $8.6 billion in 2020 due to a full year amortization of revlimid, pomalyst/imnovid and other marketed product rights obtained in the celgene acquisition.
•other (income)/expense, net changed by $3.3 billion in 2020, primarily due to fair value adjustments to contingent value rights and equity investments in 2020 and other items discussed below.
components of other (income)/expense, net were as follows:
transition and other service fees               (149)                            (37)
intangible asset impairment                        21                              15
•interest expense increased due to $19.0 billion of notes issued in may 2019 and $19.9 billion of celgene debt assumed in the acquisition.
•contingent consideration primarily includes fair value adjustments resulting from the change in the traded price of contingent value rights issued with the celgene acquisition. the contractual obligation to pay the contingent value rights terminated in january 2021 because the fda did not approve liso-cel (jcar017) by december 31, 2020.
•royalties and licensing income includes diabetes business royalties, keytruda* and tecentriq* royalties, and up-front and milestone licensing fees for products that have not obtained commercial approval. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 4. acquisitions, divestitures, licensing and other arrangements" for further information.
•equity investment gains includes fair value adjustments on equity investments that have readily determinable fair value and other observable price changes on equity investments without readily determinable fair values. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 9. financial instruments and fair value measurements" for more information. our share of income from equity method investments was $72 million in 2020. a termination fee related to our europe and asia partnership with sanofi of $80 million was included in 2019.
•provision for restructuring includes exit and other costs primarily related to the celgene acquisition plans. we have achieved approximately $1.4 billion of annualized pre-tax cost savings in 2020 related to the celgene acquisition plan and are on track to achieve the annualized pre-tax cost savings of approximately $3.0 billion through 2022 as detailed in the restructuring activities. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 6. restructuring" for further information.

the tax impact attributed to specified items was primarily due to the unwinding of inventory fair value adjustments and intangible asset amortization resulting from the celgene acquisition, a non-deductible myokardia iprd charge and non-taxable fair value adjustments to contingent value rights in the current year. in addition, a $853 million deferred tax charge resulting from an internal transfer of certain intangible assets and an additional $266 million gilti tax charge upon finalization of the otezla* divestiture tax consequences with tax authorities were included in 2020. the tax impact attributed to specified items including the otezla* divestiture, pension settlement charges, gain on sale of the upsa business divestiture and other specified items increased the effective tax rate in the prior year. the effective tax rate excluding specified items includes a tax reserve release due to lapse of statue of $81 million in 2019. other favorable discrete tax adjustments were approximately $140 million in 2020 and $170 million in 2019 primarily resulting from finalization of prior year tax returns and the impact of the swiss tax reform (2019 only). refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 7. income taxes" for further information.
non-gaap financial measures our non-gaap financial measures, such as non-gaap earnings and related eps information, are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that are evaluated on an individual basis. these items are adjusted after considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects and typically have one or more of the following characteristics, such as being highly variable, difficult to project, unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of future operating results. similar charges or gains were recognized in prior periods and will likely reoccur in future periods including (i) amortization of acquired intangible assets beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, including product rights that generate a significant portion of our ongoing revenue and will recur until the intangible assets are fully amortized, (ii) unwind of inventory fair value adjustments, (iii) acquisition and integration expenses, (iv) restructuring costs, (v) accelerated depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, (vi) r&d charges or other income resulting from upfront or contingent milestone payments in connection with the acquisition or licensing of third-party intellectual property rights, (vii) costs of acquiring a priority review voucher, (viii) iprd charge resulting from the myokardia acquisition, (ix) divestiture gains or losses, (x) stock compensation resulting from accelerated vesting of celgene awards and certain retention-related employee compensation charges related to the celgene transaction, (xi) pension, legal and other contractual settlement charges, (xii) interest expense on the notes issued in may 2019 incurred prior to our celgene transaction and interest income earned on the net proceeds of those notes, (xiii) equity investment and contingent value rights fair value adjustments and (xiv) amortization of fair value adjustments of debt acquired from celgene in our 2019 exchange offer, among other items. deferred and current income taxes attributed to these items are also adjusted for considering their individual impact to the overall tax expense, deductibility and jurisdictional tax rates. certain other significant tax items are also excluded such as the impact resulting from internal transfer of intangible assets and the otezla* divestiture. we also provide international revenues for our priority products excluding the impact of foreign exchange. reconciliations of these non-gaap measures to the most comparable gaap measures are included in exhibit 99.2 to our form 8-k filed on february 4, 2021 and are incorporated herein by reference.
non-gaap information is intended to portray the results of our baseline performance, supplement or enhance management, analysts and investors' overall understanding of our underlying financial performance and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods. for example, non-gaap earnings and eps information is an indication of our baseline performance before items that are considered by us to not be reflective of our ongoing results. in addition, this information is among the primary indicators that we use as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets and planning and forecasting for future periods. this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted eps prepared in accordance with gaap and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted. we encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

total cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities            16,264                        16,160
we regularly assess our anticipated working capital needs, debt and leverage levels, debt maturities, capital expenditure requirements, dividend payouts, potential share repurchases and future investments or acquisitions in order to maximize shareholder return, efficiently finance our ongoing operations and maintain flexibility for future strategic transactions. we also regularly evaluate our capital structure to ensure financial risks, adequate liquidity access and lower cost of capital are efficiently managed, which may lead to the issuance of additional debt securities or the repurchase of debt securities prior to maturity or common stock. we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities together with cash generated from operations and, if required, from the issuance of commercial paper will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for at least the next few years, including dividends, capital expenditures, milestone payments, working capital, restructuring initiatives, business development, approximately $15.8 billion of debt maturing through 2024 as well as any debt repurchases through redemptions or tender offers.
we have a share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors allowing for repurchases of our shares. the specific timing and number of shares repurchased will be determined by our management at its discretion and will vary based on market conditions, securities law limitations and other factors. the share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares, does not have a specific expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. the repurchases may be effected through a combination of one or more open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, transactions structured through investment banking institutions and other derivative transactions, relying on rule 10b-18 and rule 10b5-1 under the exchange act. the remaining share repurchase authority authorization under the program was $1.0 billion as of december 31, 2019. our board of directors approved an increase of $5.0 billion to the share repurchase authorization for our common stock in february 2020, increasing the total outstanding share repurchase authorization to approximately $6.0 billion. in 2020, the asr agreements that we executed in 2019 to repurchase an aggregate $7 billion of common stock were settled. we also repurchased approximately 27 million shares of its common stock for $1.6 billion during the year ended december 31, 2020. the remaining share repurchase capacity under the share repurchase program was approximately $4.4 billion as of december 31, 2020. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 16. equity" for additional information. in january 2021, our board of directors approved an increase of $2.0 billion to the share repurchase authorization for our common stock.
dividend payments were $4.1 billion in 2020, $2.7 billion in 2019 and $2.6 billion in 2018. dividend decisions are made on a quarterly basis by our board of directors.
annual capital expenditures were approximately $750 million in 2020, $800 million in 2019 and $1.0 billion in 2018 and are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion in 2021 and $1.2 billion in 2022. we continue to make capital expenditures in connection with the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities, research and development and other facility-related activities.
under our commercial paper program, we may issue a maximum of $5 billion unsecured notes that have maturities of not more than 366 days from the date of issuance. there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of december 31, 2020.
as of december 31, 2020, we had four revolving credit facilities totaling $6.0 billion, which consisted of a 364-day $2.0 billion facility that expired in january 2021, a three-year $1.0 billion facility expiring in january 2022 and two five-year $1.5 billion facilities that were extended in january 2021 to september 2024 and july 2025, respectively. the facilities provide for customary terms and conditions with no financial covenants and may be used to provide backup liquidity for our commercial paper borrowings. our $1.0 billion facility and our two $1.5 billion revolving facilities are extendable annually by one year on the anniversary date with the consent of the lenders. no borrowings were outstanding under revolving credit facilities at december 31, 2020 and 2019. in january 2021, we entered into a 364-day $2.0 billion facility expiring in january 2022, which is extendable annually by one year on the anniversary date with the consent of the lenders.
in november 2020, we entered into a $4.0 billion delayed draw term loan credit agreement consisting of a $2.0 billion 364-day tranche and a $2.0 billion two-year tranche. the term facility provides for customary terms and conditions with no financial covenants and may be used for general corporate purposes. any unused credit expires on april 9, 2021. no borrowings were outstanding under the term loan as of december 31, 2020. in february 2021, we terminated the delayed draw term loan credit agreement.
also in november 2020, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $7.0 billion of fixed rate unsecured senior notes at maturities ranging from 3 years to 30 years. the net proceeds were used to fund a portion of the aggregate cash consideration payable to myokardia shareholders in connection with our acquisition of myokardia and to pay related fees and expenses. interest is payable semi-annually. the notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and are redeemable at any time, in whole, or in part, at varying specified redemption prices plus accrued and unpaid interest.
our investment portfolio includes non-current marketable securities, which are subject to changes in fair value as a result of interest rate fluctuations and other market factors. our investment policy establishes limits on the amount and time to maturity of investments with any institution. the policy also requires that investments are only entered into with corporate and financial institutions that meet high credit quality standards. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 9. financial instruments and fair value measurements" for further information.
credit ratings our current long-term and short-term credit ratings assigned by moody's investors service are a2 and prime-1, respectively, with a stable long-term credit outlook, and our current long-term and short-term credit ratings assigned by standard & poor's are a+ and a-1, respectively with a negative long-term credit outlook. the long-term ratings reflect the agencies' opinion that we have a low default risk but are somewhat susceptible to adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions. the short-term ratings reflect the agencies' opinion that we have good to extremely strong capacity for timely repayment. any credit rating downgrade may affect the interest rate of any debt we may incur, the fair market value of existing debt and our ability to access the capital markets generally.

operating activities cash flow from operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements from all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. operating cash flow is derived by adjusting net earnings for noncontrolling interest, non-cash operating items, gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities and changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting from timing differences between the receipts and payments of cash and when the transactions are recognized in our results of operations. as a result, changes in cash from operating activities reflect the timing of cash collections from customers and alliance partners; payments to suppliers, alliance partners and employees; customer discounts and rebates; and tax payments in the ordinary course of business. for example, annual employee bonuses are typically paid in the first quarter of the subsequent year. in addition, cash collections continue to be impacted by longer payment terms for certain biologic products in the u.s., primarily our newer oncology products including opdivo, yervoy and empliciti (75 days in 2020 and 90 days in 2019). the longer payment terms are used to more closely align with the insurance reimbursement timing for physicians and cancer centers following administration to the patients.
the $5.8 billion change in cash flow from operating activities compared to 2019 was primarily due to the celgene acquisition, including higher collection and payments in the ordinary course of business, partially offset by higher interest payments of $1.2 billion and income tax payments of $1.9 billion (including $1.1 billion attributed to the otezla* divestiture) and the cash settlement of unvested myokardia stock awards of approximately $500 million.
investing activities cash requirements from investing activities include cash used for acquisitions, manufacturing and facility-related capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities with original maturities greater than 90 days at the time of purchase, proceeds from business divestitures (including royalties), the sale and maturity of marketable securities and upfront and contingent milestones from licensing arrangements.
the $946 million change in cash flow from investing activities compared to 2019 was primarily attributable to:
•lower business divestiture proceeds of approximately $15.0 billion primarily due to the divestitures of otezla* and upsa consumer health business in 2019.
partially offset by:
•lower net acquisition and other payments of approximately $11.7 billion primarily due to the acquisitions of celgene in 2019 and myokardia in 2020; and
•changes in the amount of marketable debt securities held of $2.3 billion.
financing activities cash requirements from financing activities include cash used to pay dividends, repurchase common stock and repay long-term debt and other borrowings reduced by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of long-term debt and other borrowings.
the $8.8 billion change in cash flow from financing activities compared to 2019 was primarily attributable to:
•lower net borrowing activity of $13.3 billion primarily resulting from the issuance of notes to fund the acquisitions of celgene in 2019 and myokardia in 2020 and lower repayments of debt maturities in 2020; and
•higher dividend payments of approximately $1.4 billion.
partially offset by:
•lower stock repurchase of $5.8 billion primarily resulting from the accelerated stock repurchase cash payment of $7.0 billion in 2019.
contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements payments due by period for our contractual obligations at december 31, 2020 were as follows:
operating leases(b)                           1,916                      196                     189                     193                     158                     136                   1,044
(a)    includes estimated future interest payments and periodic cash settlements of derivatives.
(b)    refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 13. leases" for further information regarding our leases.
(c)    includes only short-term uncertain tax benefits because of uncertainties regarding the timing of resolution.
(d)    excludes other non-current liabilities because of uncertainties regarding the timing of resolution.
we are committed to an aggregate $22.0 billion of potential future research and development milestone payments to third parties for in-licensing, asset acquisitions and development programs including early-stage milestones of $8.1 billion (milestones achieved through phase iii clinical studies) and late-stage milestones of $13.9 billion (milestones achieved post phase iii clinical studies). payments generally are due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental and regulatory milestones for which the specific timing cannot be predicted. certain agreements also provide for sales-based milestones aggregating to $14.7 billion that we would be obligated to pay to alliance partners upon achievement of certain sales levels in addition to royalties. we also have certain manufacturing, development and commercialization obligations in connection with alliance arrangements. it is not practicable to estimate the amount of these obligations. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 3. alliances" for further information regarding our alliances.
contingent value rights were issued in connection with the celgene acquisition. these rights were measured at fair value and payments were contingent upon the achievement of future regulatory milestones. each cvr right entitled the shareholder to receive a one-time potential payment of $9.00 in cash only upon fda approval of all three of the following milestones: (i) ozanimod by december 31, 2020, (ii) liso-cel (jcar017) by december 31, 2020, and (iii) ide-cel (bb2121) by march 31, 2021. the contractual obligation to pay the contingent value rights terminated in january 2021 because the fda did not approve liso-cel (jcar017) by december 31, 2020.
we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our financial condition or results of operations.
sec consent order / fcpa settlement as previously disclosed, on august 4, 2004, we entered into a final settlement with the sec, concluding an investigation concerning certain wholesaler inventory and accounting matters. the settlement was reached through a consent, a copy of which was attached as exhibit 10 to our quarterly report on form 10-q for the period ended september 30, 2004.
under the terms of the consent, we agreed, subject to certain defined exceptions, to limit sales of all products sold to our direct customers (including wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, retail outlets, pharmacies and government purchasers) based on expected demand or on amounts that do not exceed approximately one month of inventory on hand, without making a timely public disclosure of any change in practice. we also agreed in the consent to certain measures that we have implemented including: (a) establishing a formal review and certification process of our annual and quarterly reports filed with the sec; (b) establishing a business risk and disclosure group; (c) retaining an outside consultant to comprehensively study and help re-engineer our accounting and financial reporting processes; (d) publicly disclosing any sales incentives offered to direct customers for the purpose of inducing them to purchase products in excess of expected demand; and (e) ensuring that our budget process gives appropriate weight to inputs that come from the bottom to the top, and not just from the top to the bottom, and adequately documenting that process.
we have established a company-wide policy concerning our sales to direct customers for the purpose of complying with the consent, which includes the adoption of various procedures to monitor and limit sales to direct customers in accordance with the terms of the consent. these procedures include a governance process to escalate to appropriate management levels potential questions or concerns regarding compliance with the policy and timely resolution of such questions or concerns. in addition, compliance with the policy is monitored on a regular basis.
we maintain dsas with our u.s. pharmaceutical wholesalers, which account for nearly 100% of our gross u.s. revenues. under the current terms of the dsas, our wholesaler customers provide us with weekly information with respect to months on hand product-level inventories and the amount of out-movement of products. the three largest wholesalers currently account for approximately 75% of our gross u.s. revenues. the inventory information received from our wholesalers, together with our internal information, is used to estimate months on hand product level inventories at these wholesalers. we estimate months on hand product inventory levels for our u.s. business's wholesaler customers other than the three largest wholesalers by extrapolating from the months on hand calculated for the three largest wholesalers. in contrast, our non-u.s. business has significantly more direct customers, limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information, where available, varies widely. accordingly, we rely on a variety of methods to estimate months on hand product level inventories for these business units.
recently issued accounting standards for recently issued accounting standards, refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 1. accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards."
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. our critical accounting policies are those that significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. because of this uncertainty, actual results may vary from these estimates.
revenue recognition our accounting policy for revenue recognition has a substantial impact on reported results and relies on certain estimates. revenue is recognized following a five-step model: (i) identify the customer contract; (ii) identify the contract's performance obligation; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation; and (v) recognize revenue when or as a performance obligation is satisfied. revenue is also reduced for gtn sales adjustments discussed below, all of which involve significant estimates and judgment after considering legal interpretations of applicable laws and regulations, historical experience, payer channel mix (e.g. medicare or medicaid), current contract prices under applicable programs, unbilled claims and processing time lags and inventory levels in the distribution channel. estimates are assessed each period and adjusted as required to revise information or actual experience.
the following categories of gtn adjustments involve significant estimates, judgments and information obtained from external sources. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 2. revenue." for further discussion and analysis of each significant category of gtn sales adjustments.
charge-backs and cash discounts our u.s. business participates in programs with government entities, the most significant of which are the u.s. department of defense and the u.s. department of veterans affairs, and other parties, including covered entities under the 340b drug pricing program, whereby pricing on products is extended below wholesaler list price to participating entities. these entities purchase products through wholesalers at the lower program price and the wholesalers then charge us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower program price. accounts receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of unprocessed charge-back claims attributable to a sale (typically within a two to four week time lag).
in the u.s. and certain other countries, customers are offered cash discounts as an incentive for prompt payment, generally approximating 2% of the invoiced sales price. accounts receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of cash discount at the time of sale and the discount is typically taken by the customer within one month.
medicaid and medicare rebates our u.s. business participates in state government medicaid programs and other qualifying federal and state government programs requiring discounts and rebates to participating state and local government entities. all discounts and rebates provided through these programs are included in our medicaid rebate accrual. medicaid rebates have also been extended to drugs used in managed medicaid plans. the estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates is presented as a liability.
rebates and discounts are offered to managed healthcare organizations in the u.s. managing prescription drug programs and medicare advantage prescription drug plans covering the medicare part d drug benefit. we also pay a 70% point of service discount to the cms when the medicare part d beneficiaries are in the coverage gap ("donut hole"). the estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates and discounts is presented as a liability.
other rebates, returns, discounts and adjustments other gtn sales adjustments include sales returns and all other programs based on applicable laws and regulations for individual non-u.s. countries as well as rebates offered to managed healthcare organizations in the u.s. to a lesser extent. the non-u.s. programs include several different pricing schemes such as cost caps, volume discounts, outcome-based pricing schemes and pricing claw-backs that are based on sales of individual companies or an aggregation of all companies participating in a specific market. the estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates and discounts is presented as a liability.
estimated returns for established products are determined after considering historical experience and other factors including levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product recalls, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, introductions of generic products, introductions of competitive new products and lower demand following the loe. estimated returns for new products are determined after considering historical sales return experience of similar products, such as those within the same product line, similar therapeutic area and/or similar distribution model and estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and projected demand. the estimated amount for product returns is presented as a liability.
use of information from external sources information from external sources is used to estimate gtn adjustments. our estimate of inventory at the wholesalers is based on the projected prescription demand-based sales for our products and historical inventory experience, as well as our analysis of third-party information, including written and oral information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and sell-through to customers and third-party market research data, and our internal information. the inventory information received from wholesalers is a product of their recordkeeping process and excludes inventory held by intermediaries to whom they sell, such as retailers and hospitals.
we have also continued the practice of combining retail and mail prescription volume on a retail-equivalent basis. we use this methodology for internal demand forecasts. we also use information from external sources to identify prescription trends, patient demand and average selling prices. our estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third-party information, as certain third-party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations including lags between the date as of which third-party information is generated and the date on which we receive third-party information.
long-lived assets intangible assets valuations a significant amount of the purchase price for the celgene acquisition was allocated to intangible assets, including commercially marketed products and iprd assets. our intangible assets were $53.2 billion as of december 31, 2020 and $64.0 billion as of december 31, 2019.
identifiable intangible assets are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. we engaged an independent third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date. the fair value of these assets were estimated using discounted cash flow models. these models required the use of the following significant estimates and assumptions among others:
•identification of product candidates with sufficient substance requiring separate recognition;
•estimates of revenues and operating profits related to commercial products or product candidates;
•eligible patients, pricing and market share used in estimating future revenues;
•probability of success for unapproved product candidates and additional indications for commercial products;
•resources required to complete the development and approval of product candidates;
•timing of regulatory approvals and exclusivity;
•market participant income tax rates; and
•allocation of expected synergies to products.
we believe the estimated and preliminary fair value assigned to intangible assets acquired used reasonable estimates and assumptions considering the facts and circumstances as of the acquisition date.
impairment and amortization of long-lived assets, including intangible assets long-lived assets include intangible assets and property, plant and equipment and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable or at least annually for iprd. intangible assets are highly vulnerable to impairment charges, particularly newly acquired assets for recently launched products or iprd. these assets are initially measured at fair value and therefore any reduction in expectations used in the valuations could potentially lead to impairment. some of the more common potential risks leading to impairment include competition, earlier than expected loe, pricing reductions, adverse regulatory changes or clinical study results, delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval for initial or follow on indications and unanticipated development costs, inability to achieve expected synergies resulting from cost savings and avoidance, higher operating costs, changes in tax laws and other macro-economic changes. the complexity in estimating the fair value of intangible assets in connection with an impairment test is similar to the initial valuation. if the carrying value of long-lived assets exceeds its fair value, then the asset is written-down to its fair value. expectations of future cash flows are subject to change based upon the near and long-term production volumes and margins generated by the asset as well as any potential alternative future use. the estimated useful lives of long-lived assets is subjective and requires significant judgment regarding patent lives, future plans and external market factors. long-lived assets are also periodically reviewed for changes in facts or circumstances resulting in a reduction to the estimated useful life of the asset, requiring the acceleration of depreciation. in 2020, a $575 million impairment charge was recorded in cost of products sold resulting from lower cash flow projections reflecting revised commercial forecasts for inrebic, resulting in the full impairment of the asset. additionally, a $470 million impairment charge was recorded in research and development expense resulting from the decision to discontinue further development of the orva-cel program. inrebic and orva-cel were obtained in connection with the acquisition of celgene.
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired in a business combination. goodwill was $20.5 billion and $22.5 billion as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
we assess the goodwill balance within our single reporting unit annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable to determine whether any impairment in this asset may exist and, if so, the extent of such impairment. goodwill is reviewed for impairment by assessing qualitative factors, including comparing our market capitalization to the carrying value of our assets. events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts.
income taxes valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. the assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including long-range forecasts of future taxable income and evaluation of tax planning initiatives. adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made. our deferred tax assets were $3.5 billion at december 31, 2020 (net of valuation allowances of $2.8 billion) and $2.1 billion at december 31, 2019 (net of valuation allowances of $2.8 billion).
the u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards were $1.5 billion at december 31, 2020. these carryforwards were acquired as a result of certain acquisitions and are subject to limitations under section 382 of the internal revenue code. the net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2022. the foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2021 (certain amounts have unlimited lives).
prior to the mead johnson split-off in 2009, the following transactions occurred: (i) an internal spin-off of mead johnson shares while still owned by us; (ii) conversion of mead johnson class b shares to class a shares; and (iii) conversion of mead johnson & company to a limited liability company. these transactions as well as the split-off of mead johnson through the exchange offer should qualify as tax-exempt transactions under the internal revenue code based upon a private letter ruling received from the internal revenue service related to the conversion of mead johnson class b shares to class a shares, and outside legal opinions.
certain assumptions, representations and covenants by mead johnson were relied upon regarding the future conduct of its business and other matters which could affect the tax treatment of the exchange. for example, the current tax law generally creates a presumption that the exchange would be taxable to us, if mead johnson or its shareholders were to engage in transactions that result in a 50% or greater change in its stock ownership during a four year period beginning two years before the exchange offer, unless it is established that the exchange offer were not part of a plan or series of related transactions to effect such a change in ownership. if the internal spin-off or exchange offer were determined not to qualify as a tax exempt transaction, the transaction could be subject to tax as if the exchange was a taxable sale by us at market value.
in addition, a negative basis or excess loss account ("ela") existed in our investment in stock of mead johnson prior to these transactions. we received an opinion from outside legal counsel to the effect that it is more likely than not that we eliminated the ela as part of these transactions and do not have taxable income with respect to the ela. the tax law in this area is complex and it is possible that even if the internal spin-off and the exchange offer is tax exempt under the internal revenue code, the internal revenue service could assert that we have additional taxable income for the period with respect to the ela. we could be exposed to additional taxes if this were to occur. based upon our understanding of the internal revenue code and opinion from outside legal counsel, a tax reserve of $244 million was established reducing the gain on disposal of mead johnson included in discontinued operations in 2009.
we agreed to certain tax related indemnities with mead johnson as set forth in the tax sharing agreement, including certain taxes related to its business prior to the completion of the initial public offering and created as part of the restructuring to facilitate the ipo. mead johnson has also agreed to indemnify us for potential tax effects resulting from the breach of certain representations discussed above as well as certain transactions related to the acquisition of mead johnson's stock or assets.
liabilities are established for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known tax exposures including, but not limited to, transfer pricing matters, tax credits and deductibility of certain expenses. such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid and may need to be adjusted over time as more information becomes known.
for discussions on income taxes, refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 1. accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards-income taxes" and "-note 7. income taxes."
contingencies in the normal course of business, we are subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others, government investigations, shareholder lawsuits, product and environmental liability, contractual claims and tax matters. we recognize accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. these estimates are subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, as such, actual results could vary from these estimates.
for discussions on contingencies, refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 1. accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards-contingencies," "-note 7. income taxes" and "-note 19. legal proceedings and contingencies."
product and pipeline developments our r&d programs are managed on a portfolio basis from early discovery through late-stage development and include a balance of early-stage and late-stage programs to support future growth. our late stage r&d programs in phase iii development include both investigational compounds for initial indications and additional indications or formulations for marketed products. spending on these programs represent approximately 40% of our annual r&d expenses in the last three years. opdivo was the only investigational compound or marketed product that represented greater than 10% of our r&d expenses in the last three years. our late-stage development programs could potentially have an impact on our revenue and earnings within the next few years if regulatory approvals are obtained and products are successfully commercialized. the following are the developments in our marketed products and our late-stage pipeline:

august 2020                            ono, our alliance partner for opdivo in japan, announced top-line results from the phase iii clinical study tasuki-52 evaluating opdivo in combination with bevacizumab and chemotherapy versus placebo in combination with bevacizumab and chemotherapy in chemotherapy-naive patients with stage iiib/iv or recurrent non-squamous nsclc. the opdivo combination group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of progression-free survival in a pre-specified interim analysis.
february 2020                          ono, our alliance partner for opdivo in japan, announced the submission of a supplemental application in japan for opdivo to expand the use for the treatment of unresectable advanced or recurrent nsclc, in combination treatment with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, for a partial change in approved items of the manufacturing and marketing approval.

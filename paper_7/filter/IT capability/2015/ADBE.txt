item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.
acquisitions during fiscal 2015, we completed our acquisition of privately held fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, images, graphics and hd videos, for $807.5 million. during fiscal 2015, we integrated fotolia into our digital media reportable segment.
during fiscal 2013, we completed our acquisitions of privately held neolane, a leader in cross-channel campaign management technology for $616.7 million, and privately held behance, an online social media platform to showcase and discover creative work for $111.1 million. during fiscal 2013, we integrated neolane and behance into our digital marketing and digital media reportable segments, respectively.
we also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. pro forma information has not been presented for any of our fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 acquisitions as the impact to our consolidated financial statements was not material.
see note 2 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these acquisitions.
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the sec, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. we base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. on a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. we also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors.
we believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business combinations, goodwill impairment and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. these areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.
revenue recognition our revenue is derived from the licensing of subscription, perpetual and time-based software products, associated software maintenance and support plans, non-software related hosted services, consulting services, training and technical support.
we recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report.
we enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, maintenance and support, hosted services and consulting.
for our software and software-related multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor-specific objective evidence ("vsoe"); and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements. vsoe of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the undelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements. absent vsoe, revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which vsoe of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered. however, if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.
we determine vsoe for each element based on historical stand-alone sales to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the elements contained in the initial arrangement. in determining vsoe, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range.
we have established vsoe for our software maintenance and support services, custom software development services, consulting services and training, when such services are sold optionally with software licenses.
for multiple-element arrangements containing our non-software services, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of vsoe of selling price, third-party evidence ("tpe") of selling price or best-estimated selling price ("besp"), as applicable; and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method.
for multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to software or software-related elements as a group and any non-software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy. we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vsoe of selling price, if it exists, or tpe of selling price. if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exist for a deliverable, we use besp. once revenue is allocated to software or software-related elements as a group, we recognize revenue in conformance with software revenue accounting guidance. revenue is recognized when revenue recognition criteria are met for each element.
we are generally unable to establish vsoe or tpe for non-software elements and as such, we use besp. besp is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, major product groupings, geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. pricing practices taken into consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. we must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. accordingly, our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.
product revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met. we reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future returns, price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded. in determining our estimate for returns and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. product returns may be more or less than what was estimated. the amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. our estimate of the rate of sell-through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. there could be a delay in the release of our products. these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus impacting our financial position and results of operations.
in the future, actual returns and price protection may exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing products. while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. accordingly, if our estimates change, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which would impact the total net revenue we report.
we recognize revenue for hosted services that are based on a committed number of transactions ratably beginning on the date the services are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term. over-usage fees, and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which we capture data, are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred. we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.
our consulting revenue is recognized on a time and materials basis and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable.
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, assumed equity awards, as well as to in-process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets, deferred revenue obligations and equity assumed.
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:
•   future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;
•   expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed;
•   the acquired company's trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company's product portfolio; and in connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed. the estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. the cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. the estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical costs related to fulfilling the obligations.
in connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the equity awards assumed. the estimated fair value is determined utilizing a modified binomial option pricing model which assumes employees exercise their stock options when the share price exceeds the strike price by a certain dollar threshold. if the acquired company has significant historical data on their employee's exercise behavior, then this threshold is determined based upon the acquired company's history. otherwise, our historical exercise experience is used to determine the exercise threshold. zero coupon yields implied by u.s. treasury issuances, implied volatility for our common stock and our historical forfeiture rate are other inputs to the binomial model.
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
goodwill impairment we complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis, during the second quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently, if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist. in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill, we typically estimate future revenue, consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows. based on these key assumptions, judgments and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value. assumptions, judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective. they can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. although we believe the assumptions, judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results.
we completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and determined there was no impairment. the results of our annual impairment test indicate that the fair values of our reporting units are significantly in excess of their carrying values.
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. in addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset.
our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. in addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other domestic and foreign tax authorities, including a current examination by the irs of our fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax returns. we expect future examinations to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. we regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from the current examinations. we believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, the final determination of any of these examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.
our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.
we are a united states-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple u.s. and foreign tax jurisdictions. a significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our irish subsidiaries. in addition to providing for u.s. income taxes on earnings from the united states, we provide for u.s. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the united states. while we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related u.s. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings.
our income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations. unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in, or our interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. the united states, countries in the european union and other countries where we do business have been considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as adobe. these potential changes could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us.
recent accounting pronouncements on november 20, 2015, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued asu no. 2015-17, balance sheet classification of deferred taxes, requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any related valuation allowance, to be classified as non-current on the balance sheet. the classification change for all deferred taxes as non-current simplifies entities' processes as it eliminates the need to separately identify the net current and net non-current deferred tax asset or liability in each jurisdiction and allocate valuation allowances. we elected to prospectively adopt the accounting standard in the beginning of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. prior periods in our consolidated financial statements were not retrospectively adjusted.
recent accounting pronouncements not yet effective on may 28, 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers, requiring an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. the updated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in u.s. gaap when it becomes effective and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. in august 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-14, revenue from contracts with customers: deferral of the effective date, which deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard for periods beginning after december 15, 2016 to december 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted but not earlier than the original effective date. accordingly, the updated standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. we have not yet selected a transition method and we are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
with the exception of the new revenue standard discussed above, there have been no new accounting pronouncements not yet effective that have significance, or potential significance, to our consolidated financial statements.
results of operations overview of 2015
for fiscal 2015, we reported financial results consistent with the continued execution of our long-term plans for our two strategic growth areas, digital media and digital marketing, while continuing to market and license a broad portfolio of products and solutions.
in our digital media segment, we are a market leader with adobe creative cloud, our subscription-based offering for creating and publishing content and applications. creative cloud, first delivered in may 2012, is our next-generation offering that supersedes our historical model of licensing our creative products with perpetual licenses. creative cloud delivers value through more frequent product updates, storage and access to user files stored in the cloud with syncing of files across users' machines, access to marketplace, social and community-based features with our adobe stock and behance services, app creation capabilities and lower entry point pricing for cost-sensitive customers.
we offer creative cloud for individuals and for teams, and we enable larger enterprise customers to acquire creative cloud capabilities through enterprise term license agreements ("etlas"). the three creative cloud offerings address the multiple routes to market we use to license our creative software to targeted customers. adoption of creative cloud has transformed our business model, and we continue to expect this to drive higher long-term revenue growth through an expansion of our customer base by acquiring new users through a lower cost of entry and delivery of additional features and value, as well as keeping existing customers current on our latest release. we have also built out a marketplace for creative cloud subscribers, most notably with our acquisition of fotolia in january of 2015, to enable the delivery and purchase of stock assets in our new service called adobe stock. overall, our strategy with creative cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and shift our revenue to be more recurring and predictable as revenue is recognized ratably.
we continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our creative cloud offering. these strategies include increasing the value creative cloud users receive such as offering new mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to try out and ultimately subscribe to creative cloud. because of the shift towards creative cloud subscriptions and etlas, perpetual revenue for older creative products has continued to decline, and revenue from perpetual licensing of these products was immaterial for fiscal 2015.
we are also a market leader with our document cloud offerings built around our acrobat family of products, the adobe reader dc and a set of integrated cloud-based document services, including adobe esign. adobe acrobat provides reliable creation and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source type. in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we delivered the next generation of this offering called adobe document cloud, which we believe enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices. adobe document cloud includes all-new adobe acrobat dc and adobe esign releases and a set of integrated services enable users to create, review, approve, sign and track documents whether on a desktop or mobile device. acrobat dc, with a touch-enabled user interface, is licensed both through subscription and perpetual pricing.
annualized recurring revenue ("arr") is currently our key performance metric to assess the health and trajectory of our overall digital media segment. arr should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue as arr is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. we plan to adjust our reported arr on an annual basis to reflect any material exchange rates changes. we calculate arr as follows:
creative arr         annual value of creative cloud subscriptions and services+ annual digital publishing suite contract value + annual creative etla contract value document cloud arr   annual value of document cloud subscriptions and services +annual document cloud etla contract value digital media arr    creative arr+ document cloud arr total creative arr exiting fiscal 2015 was $2.60 billion, up from $1.61 billion at the end of fiscal 2014. we exited fiscal 2015 with 6.167 million paid creative cloud subscriptions, up 78% from 3.458 million at the end of fiscal 2014.
our digital media segment also includes our document cloud products and solutions, including our newly released acrobat dc product which helped grow document cloud arr to $397 million exiting fiscal 2015, up from $265 million at the end of fiscal 2014.
total digital media arr grew to approximately $3.00 billion at the end of fiscal 2015, up from $1.88 billion at the end of fiscal 2014, demonstrating the progress we have made with the transformation of our business to a more recurring, ratable and predictable revenue model. our reported arr results in fiscal 2015 are based on currency rates set at the start of fiscal 2015 and held constant throughout the year. revaluing our ending arr for fiscal 2015 using currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2016, our digital media arr at the end of fiscal 2015 would be $2.88 billion or approximately $114 million lower than the arr reported above.
we are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our digital marketing segment. our adobe marketing cloud now includes eight solutions which address the expanding needs of marketers. in fiscal 2015, we achieved record marketing cloud revenue of $1.36 billion, which represents 16% year-over-year revenue growth. in addition, we drove strong demand and bookings growth for our marketing cloud solutions, which we expect will positively benefit revenue growth in future quarters.
financial performance summary for fiscal 2015
•   during fiscal 2015, our subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased to 67% from 50% compared with fiscal 2014, as we transitioned more of our business to a subscription-based model.
•   total digital media arr of approximately $3.00 billion as of november 27, 2015 increased by $1.12 billion, or 60%, from $1.88 billion as of november 28, 2014. the change in our digital media arr was primarily due to increases in the number of paid creative cloud individual and team subscriptions and continued adoption of our etlas, and to a lesser extent, the adoption of our document cloud offering through our etlas and increases in document cloud subscriptions.
•   adobe marketing cloud revenue of $1.36 billion increased by $188.5 million, or 16%, during fiscal 2015, from $1.17 billion in fiscal 2014. the increases were primarily due to continued adoption of our adobe experience manager ("aem") offering and increases in adobe campaign and adobe analytics revenue.
•   our total deferred revenue of $1.49 billion as of november 27, 2015 increased by $330.0 million, or 29%, from $1.16 billion as of november 28, 2014, primarily due to increases in creative cloud individual and team subscriptions, etlas and new contracts and existing renewals for our adobe marketing cloud services. also contributing to the increase in deferred revenue were the increases associated with our stock photography offering from the acquisition of fotolia in fiscal 2015.
•   cost of revenue of $744.3 million increased by $122.2 million, or 20%, during fiscal 2015, from $622.1 million in fiscal 2014. the increases were primarily due to increases in costs associated with compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount and costs of professional services driven by the increase in our professional services business.
•   operating expenses of $3.15 billion increased by $35.8 million during fiscal 2015, from $3.11 billion in fiscal 2014. the increase is due to higher costs associated with compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount and amortization of intangibles from the fotolia acquisition in fiscal 2015.

our subscription revenue is comprised primarily of fees we charge for our subscription and hosted service offerings including creative cloud and certain of our adobe marketing cloud and document cloud services. we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of agreements with our customers, beginning with commencement of the service. we expect our subscription revenue will continue to increase as a result of our investments in new software-as-a-service ("saas") and subscription models.
we have the following reportable segments-digital media, digital marketing and print and publishing. subscription revenue by reportable segment for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 is as follows (dollars in millions):

fiscal 2015 revenue compared to fiscal 2014 revenue digital media revenue from digital media increased $492.0 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily driven by increases in revenue associated with our creative offerings due to continued strong adoption of creative cloud. document cloud revenue remained stable during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.
creative revenue, which includes our creative cloud and perpetual creative offerings, increased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue associated with our creative cloud offerings driven by the increase in number of paid creative cloud team, individual and enterprise subscriptions. the increases associated with our creative products were offset in part by expected declines in revenue associated with our perpetual creative offerings.
document cloud revenue, which includes our acrobat product family, remained stable during fiscal 2015 as compared to the year ago period, as increases in revenue associated with esign and our document cloud subscription offering were offset by decreases in revenue associated with our document cloud perpetual license offerings. driving the increase in our document cloud subscription revenue was the adoption of our cloud offering through subscriptions and etlas.
digital marketing revenue from digital marketing increased $153.7 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to continued revenue growth associated with our adobe marketing cloud, which increased 16% as compared with the year-ago period. contributing to this increase was the continued adoption of our aem term-based offering, and to a lesser extent, increases in revenue associated with adobe campaign, adobe analytics and adobe target.
fiscal 2014 revenue compared to fiscal 2013 revenue digital media revenue from digital media decreased slightly during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. the slight decrease was primarily driven by declines in revenue associated with our perpetual creative offerings, distribution of third-party software downloads and hobbyist products launched in fiscal 2013. with respect to the hobbyist product revenue decline, we began actively migrating customers to our creative cloud photography plan in fiscal 2014, for which revenue is recognized ratably. largely offsetting these decreases were increases in creative cloud and document cloud revenue.
creative revenue, which includes our creative cloud, creative suite editions and cs point products, decreased slightly during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due to decreases in revenue from cs point products and creative suite editions, as we discontinued the general availability of our perpetually licensed cs6 products in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. also contributing to the decline in creative revenue were decreases in revenue associated with the distribution of third-party software downloads and hobbyist products launched in fiscal 2013. decreases were largely offset by increases in revenue from subscriptions and etlas and revenue from our digital publishing suite.
digital marketing revenue from digital marketing increased $126.3 million during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due to continued revenue growth associated with our adobe marketing cloud, which increased 15% during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. contributing to this increase was adobe campaign and the strong adoption of aem.
print and publishing revenue from print and publishing decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to decreases in legacy product revenue and increased etlas for certain products in this group.

fiscal 2014 revenue by geography compared to fiscal 2013 revenue by geography overall revenue increased in the americas and emea during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. revenue in the americas increased due to growth in digital media and digital marketing revenue. revenue in emea increased primarily due to growth in digital marketing revenue. digital media and print and publishing revenue in emea remained relatively stable. despite strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the euro and the british pound during the latter part of fiscal 2014, the overall weakening of the u.s. dollar against these currencies during fiscal 2014 also caused revenue in emea to increase as compared to fiscal 2013. within the americas and emea, the fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above.
revenue in apac decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of decreases in digital media revenue due to slower adoption of creative cloud in japan compared to other countries and the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the japanese yen and other asian currencies. digital marketing and print and publishing revenue in apac remained relatively stable during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013.
included in the overall change in revenue for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 were impacts associated with foreign currency as shown below. our currency hedging program is used to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency impact to revenue.
british pound              (16.1    )           12.9
during fiscal 2015, the u.s. dollar strengthened against the euro, british pound, japanese yen and other asian currencies causing revenue in emea and apac measured in u.s. dollar equivalents to decrease as compared to fiscal 2014. these decreases were partially offset by hedging gains from our emea currencies and japanese yen hedging programs during fiscal 2015.
during fiscal 2014, the u.s. dollar strengthened against the japanese yen and other asian currencies causing revenue in apac measured in u.s. dollar equivalents to decrease compared to fiscal 2013. this decrease was offset in part by the favorable impact to revenue measured in emea currencies as the u.s. dollar weakened against the euro and the british pound for the majority of fiscal 2014. our emea and yen currency hedging programs resulted in hedging gains during fiscal 2014.
see note 18 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further geographic information.
product backlog the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects. shippable backlog is comprised of unfulfilled orders, excluding those associated with new product releases, those pending credit review and those not shipped due to the application of our global inventory policy. we had minimal shippable backlog at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. we expect that our shippable backlog will continue to be insignificant in future periods.
deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable commercial subscription agreements or government contracts with fiscal funding clauses. unbilled deferred revenue represents expected future billings which are contractually committed under our existing subscription, saas and managed services agreements that have not been invoiced and are not recorded in deferred revenue within our financial statements. our presentation of unbilled deferred revenue backlog may differ from that of other companies in the industry. as of november 27, 2015, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $2.89 billion of which approximately 40% to 50% is not reasonably expected to be billed during fiscal 2016. as of november 28, 2014, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $2.19 billion, which has been updated to include $433 million of individual annual subscriptions which were not captured in the prior year due to current year enhancements to our management reporting system.
we expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue backlog will change from period to period due to certain factors, including the timing and duration of large customer subscription, saas and managed service agreements, varying billing cycles of these agreements, the timing of customer renewals, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue backlog is to be billed, changes in customer financial circumstances and foreign currency fluctuations. additionally, the unbilled deferred revenue backlog for multi-year subscription agreements that are billed annually is typically higher at the beginning of the contract period, lower prior to renewal and typically increases when the agreement is renewed. accordingly, fluctuations in unbilled deferred revenue backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future business prospects and the related revenue associated with these contractual commitments.

cost of subscription revenue increased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to data center costs, compensation and related benefits, royalty cost, depreciation expense, and purchased intangible amortization. data center costs increased primarily due to higher transaction volumes in our adobe marketing cloud and creative cloud services. depreciation expense increased primarily due to higher capital expenditures in recent periods as we continue to invest in our network and data center infrastructure to support the growth of our subscription and hosted services business. royalty cost increased primarily due to increases in subscriptions and downloads of our saas offerings and increased royalties due to the introduction of our stock photography offering from our acquisition of fotolia in fiscal 2015. amortization of purchased intangibles increased primarily due to amortization of intangibles acquired from our acquisition of fotolia in fiscal 2015.
cost of subscription revenue increased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to data center costs, compensation and related benefits, depreciation expense, and royalty cost. data center costs increased primarily due to higher transaction volumes in our adobe marketing cloud and creative cloud services. compensation cost and related benefits increased primarily due to additional headcount in fiscal 2014, including from our acquisition of neolane in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. depreciation expense increased primarily due to higher capital expenditures as we continued to invest in our network and data center infrastructure to support the growth of our business. royalty cost increased primarily due to increases in subscriptions and downloads of our saas offerings.

cost of product revenue decreased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to decreases in excess and obsolete inventory, cost of sales and amortization of purchased intangibles, partially offset by an increase in royalty cost. the increase in royalty cost was driven by royalty payments related to our stock photography perpetual offering from our acquisition of fotolia in fiscal 2015.
cost of product revenue decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to decreases in amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements, cost of sales and royalty cost, slightly offset by an increase in excess and obsolete inventory. amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements decreased as we entered into certain technology licensing arrangements for which payments of $26.5 million related to historical use of certain technology licensing arrangements were expensed as cost of product revenue during fiscal 2013. cost of sales decreased due to decreases in the number of perpetual units sold and associated packaging costs as we continued to focus our development and sales efforts on creative cloud. royalty cost decreased primarily due to decreases in revenue from our perpetual offerings. excess and obsolete inventory increased as a result of changes in reserve requirements for cs6 shrink boxes as we discontinued the general availability of cs6 on a perpetual licensing basis.
services and support cost of services and support revenue is primarily comprised of employee-related costs and associated costs incurred to provide consulting services, training and product support.
cost of services and support revenue increased in all periods presented due to increases in compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount and third-party fees to support the increase in our professional services business.

research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses research and development and sales and marketing expenses increased slightly during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to increases in compensation and related benefits associated with headcount. general and administrative expenses decreased slightly during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the reversal of a previously anticipated loss associated with the hteal proceedings, offset in part by increases in compensation and related benefits associated with headcount.
the increase in research and development and general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to increases in cash incentive and stock-based compensation. the increase in stock-based compensation was driven by a change in the vesting term for stock awards granted as part of our annual review process beginning in fiscal 2013, which decreased the term from four years to three years. the increase in sales and marketing expense during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to compensation and related benefits associated with additional headcount.
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses for software developers, contracted development efforts, related facilities costs and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development.

we believe that investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products, subscription and solution offerings. we will continue to focus on long-term opportunities available in our end markets and make significant investments in the development of our application, tool, subscription and service offerings.
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses, sales commissions, travel expenses and related facilities costs for our sales, marketing, order management and global supply chain management personnel. sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows, public relations and other market development programs.

the decrease in loss contingency during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 is due to the reversal of a previously anticipated loss associated with the hteal proceedings. see note 15 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the hteal proceedings.
restructuring and other charges during the past several years, we have initiated various restructuring plans consisting of reductions in workforce and the consolidation of facilities to better align our resources around our business strategies. as of november 27, 2015, we considered all our restructuring plans to be substantially complete. we continue to make cash outlays to settle obligations under these plans, however the current impact to our consolidated financial statements is not material.
during fiscal 2015, we recorded immaterial credits and charges to our restructuring plans.
during fiscal 2014, in connection with our fiscal 2014 restructuring plan, we recorded $19.4 million associated with termination benefits and closing redundant facilities. in connection with our other restructuring plans, we recorded insignificant charges associated with closing redundant facilities.
during fiscal 2013, we sold land, building and other assets located in waltham, massachusetts for net proceeds of $24.3 million. because the total carrying amount of these assets was $47.4 million at the time it was classified as held for sale, we recorded a write-down of $23.1 million during fiscal 2013.
also during fiscal 2013, in connection with our fiscal 2011 restructuring plan and other restructuring plans, we recorded immaterial charges and credits associated with termination benefits and closing redundant facilities during the fiscal year.
see note 10 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our restructuring plans.
amortization of purchased intangibles during the last several years, we have completed a number of business combinations and asset acquisitions. as a result of these acquisitions, we purchased intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to fourteen years.
amortization expense increased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of fotolia in fiscal 2015, partially offset by the decrease in amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of efficient frontier and day software holding ag that were fully amortized at the end of fiscal 2014.

interest and other income (expense), net increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the gain on the sale of certain property assets and, to a lesser extent, an increased average investment balance and average interest rate. see note 6 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further details regarding the sale of our property assets.
interest and other income (expense), net increased in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to decreased foreign currency losses and increased realized gains on fixed income investments. the increases were partially offset by decreased interest income on our investment in lease receivable due to the purchase of the east and west towers of our corporate headquarter offices during fiscal 2014. see note 15 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our investment in lease receivables.
interest expense interest expense primarily represents interest associated with our senior notes and interest rate swaps. interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on february 1 and august 1. floating interest payments on the interest rate swaps are paid monthly. the fixed-rate interest receivable on the swaps is received semi-annually concurrent with the senior notes interest payments.
interest expense decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due to the favorable impact of the interest rate swaps. see notes 5 and 13 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our interest rate swaps.
investment gains (losses), net investment gains (losses), net consists principally of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities and unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities) and gains and losses associated with our direct and indirect investments in privately held companies.
during fiscal 2015, total investment gains (losses), net remained stable compared to fiscal 2014.
during fiscal 2014, total investment gains (losses), net increased to net gains primarily due to write-downs for other-than-temporary declines in value of our direct investments in privately held companies in fiscal 2013 that did not recur in fiscal 2014, offset in part by a decrease in net gains related to our trading securities.

our effective tax rate increased by approximately two percentage points during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. the increase was primarily due to tax costs associated with licensing acquired company assets to adobe's trading companies. the increase was partially offset by tax benefits related to the reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit in december 2014. the reinstatement of the credit was retroactive to january 1, 2014.
our effective tax rate increased by approximately seven percentage points during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. the increase was primarily due to the expiration of the federal research and development tax credit in december 2013 and stronger domestic profits for fiscal 2014.
in december 2015, the united states congress passed the permanent extension of the federal research and development tax credit. as a result, we expect that our income tax provision for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 will include a discrete tax benefit for the 2015 credit which will reduce our effective tax rate for the quarter and, to a lesser extent, the effective annual tax rate.
we are a united states-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple u.s. and foreign tax jurisdictions. a significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our irish subsidiaries. in addition to providing for u.s. income taxes on earnings from the united states, we provide for u.s. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the united states. while we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related u.s. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. currently, there are a significant amount of foreign earnings upon which u.s. income taxes have not been provided. see note 9 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our provision for income taxes.
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at november 27, 2015 was $258.7 million, exclusive of interest and penalties. if the total unrecognized tax benefits at november 27, 2015 were recognized in the future, $220.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits would decrease the effective tax rate, which is net of an estimated $38.5 million federal benefit related to deducting certain payments on future federal and state tax returns.
as of november 27, 2015, the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns was approximately $27.8 million. this amount is included in non-current income taxes payable.
the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. these events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non-current assets and liabilities. we believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $10 million.

our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. the primary uses of cash are payroll related expenses, general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of revenue. other sources of cash are proceeds from the exercise of employee options and participation in the employee stock purchase plan. other uses of cash include our stock repurchase program, which is described below, business acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment.
cash flows from operating activities for fiscal 2015, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.47 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. the primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue, income taxes payable and trade payables. the increase in deferred revenue is primarily due to increased subscriptions for our team, individual and enterprise creative cloud offerings and increases in digital marketing hosted services. the increase in income taxes payable is primarily due to higher taxable income levels during fiscal 2015. trade payables increased primarily due to the timing of payments to web services vendors as certain invoices were received in the final weeks of fiscal 2015. the primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables which were principally due to higher revenue levels.
for fiscal 2014, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.29 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. the primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses. the increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscription and etla activity for our individual, team and enterprise creative cloud offerings and increases in digital marketing and digital publishing hosted services, offset in part by decreases in billings for our maintenance and creative product software upgrade plans which we discontinued in january 2013. accrued expenses increased primarily due to accruals for contract terminations and employee transition payments associated with business realignment initiatives implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.
for fiscal 2013, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.15 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. the primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses and decreases in trade receivables. deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased subscription and etla activity for our creative cloud offering and increases in digital marketing hosted services, offset in part by decreases in billings for our maintenance and creative product software upgrade plans which were discontinued in january 2013. accrued expenses increased primarily due to amounts due under our fiscal 2013 annual incentive plan and sales commission accruals associated with higher achievement levels. trade receivables declined primarily due to lower perpetual license revenue levels and improved collections compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.
the primary working capital uses of cash for fiscal 2013 were decreases in taxes payable and increases in prepaid expenses and other assets. the decrease in taxes payable was largely attributed to tax payments made combined with audit settlement adjustments, offset in part by tax expense and other adjustments during fiscal 2013. prepaid expenses and other assets increased primarily due to increases in short-term income tax receivables related to the carryback of federal research and development and foreign tax credits in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.
cash flows from investing activities for fiscal 2015, net cash used for investing activities of $1.49 billion was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments and our acquisition of fotolia. other uses of cash during fiscal 2015 represented purchases of property and equipment, and long-term investments and other assets. these cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments and proceeds received from the sale of certain property assets. see note 2 and note 6 of our consolidated financial statements for more detailed information regarding our acquisition of fotolia and sale of property assets, respectively.
for fiscal 2014, net cash used for investing activities of $490.7 million was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments, purchases of property and equipment and a business acquisition. these cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments.
for fiscal 2013, net cash used for investing activities of $1.18 billion was primarily due to our acquisitions of neolane and behance. other uses of cash during fiscal 2013 represented purchases of short-term investments, purchases of property and equipment associated with our construction projects in oregon and india and purchases of long-term technology licenses. these cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments and the sale of certain property assets. see note 2 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information regarding our acquisitions of neolane and behance.
cash flows from financing activities in january 2015, we issued $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due february 1, 2025 (the "2025 notes"). our proceeds were approximately $989.3 million which is net of an issuance discount of $10.7 million. the 2025 notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. in addition, we incurred issuance costs of $7.9 million in connection with our 2025 notes. both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2025 notes using the effective interest method.
we used $600 million of the proceeds from the 2025 notes offering to repay the outstanding balance plus accrued and unpaid interest of the $600 million 3.25% senior notes due february 1, 2015 ("2015 notes"). the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.  see note 16 of our consolidated financial statements for more detailed information.
in addition to the 2025 notes issuance and 2015 notes repayment, other financing activities during fiscal 2015 include payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
for fiscal 2014 and 2013, net cash used for financing activities of $507.3 million and $559.1 million, respectively, was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. see the section titled "stock repurchase program" discussed below.
we expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, venture capital, facilities expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff. furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business.
restructuring during the past several years, we have initiated various restructuring plans. we consider our restructuring plans to be substantially complete.
as of november 27, 2015, we have accrued total restructuring charges of $4.7 million, substantially all of which relate to the cost of closing redundant facilities and is expected to be paid under contract through fiscal 2021 for which approximately 75% will be paid through fiscal 2017. during fiscal 2015, we made payments related to our restructuring plans totaling $18.2 million which consisted of $16.6 million in payments associated with termination benefits and contract terminations and the remaining payments related to the closing of redundant facilities.
as of november 28, 2014, we had accrued total restructuring charges of $22.3 million of which approximately $15.0 million related to termination benefits and contract terminations. the remaining accrued restructuring charges of $7.3 million related to the cost of closing redundant facilities. during fiscal 2014, we made payments related to our restructuring plans totaling $11.0
million which consisted of $5.7 million and $5.3 million in payments related to termination benefits and contract terminations and the closing of redundant facilities, respectively.
as of november 29, 2013, we had accrued total restructuring charges of $13.9 million of which approximately $11.7 million related to the cost of closing redundant facilities. the remaining accrued restructuring charges of $2.2 million related to the cost of termination benefits and contract terminations. during fiscal 2013, we made payments related to our restructuring plans totaling $10.3 million which primarily consisted of $9.0 million in payments related to the closing of redundant facilities.
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash outlays for the restructuring actions described above.
see note 10 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our restructuring plans.
other liquidity and capital resources considerations our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2016 due to changes in our planned cash outlay, including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to our acquisitions. our cash and investments totaled $3.99 billion as of november 27, 2015. of this amount, approximately 85% was held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to material repatriation tax effects. our intent is to permanently reinvest a significant portion of our earnings from foreign operations, and current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. in the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the united states and if u.s. tax has not already been previously provided, we would provide for and pay additional u.s. taxes in connection with repatriating these funds.
cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in part i, item 1a titled "risk factors". however, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.
on march 2, 2012, we entered into a five-year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the "credit agreement"), providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries. on march 1, 2013, we exercised our option under the credit agreement to extend the maturity date of the credit agreement by one year to march 2, 2018. on july 27, 2015, we entered into an amendment to further extend the maturity date of the credit agreement to july 27, 2020 and reallocated the facility among the syndicate of lenders that are parties to the credit agreement. as of november 27, 2015, there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit agreement and the entire $1 billion credit line remains available for borrowing.
as of november 27, 2015, the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.9 billion, consisting of $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due february 1, 2020 (the "2020 notes") and $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due february 1, 2025 (together with the 2020 notes, the "notes").
our short-term investment portfolio is primarily invested in corporate bonds and commercial paper, u.s. agency securities and u.s. treasury securities, foreign government securities, municipal securities and asset-backed securities.we use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash. external investment firms managed, on average, 57% of our consolidated invested balances during fiscal 2015.
stock repurchase program to facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, the board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program granting the company authority to repurchase up to $2 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2017.
during fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $625 million, $600 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. of the $625 million in prepayments made during fiscal 2015, $425 million were under the new $2 billion stock repurchase program and the remaining $200 million were under the previous $2 billion authority. the $600 million and $1.1 billion in prepayments made during fiscal 2014 and 2013 were under the previous $2 billion stock repurchase authority. we enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the volume weighted average price ("vwap") of our common stock over a specified period of time. we only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than our estimate of the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. there were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.
the financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. the parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average vwap of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. during fiscal 2015, we repurchased approximately 8.1 million shares at an average price of $77.38 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. during fiscal 2014, we repurchased approximately 10.9 million shares at an average price of $63.48 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013. during fiscal 2013, we repurchased approximately 21.6 million shares at an average price per share of $46.47 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012.
for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by november 27, 2015, november 28, 2014 and november 29, 2013 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. as of november 27, 2015, $38.2 million of prepayments remained under the agreement. see note 13 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our stock repurchase programs.
subsequent to november 27, 2015, as part of our $2 billion stock repurchase program, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $150 million. this amount will be classified as treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets. upon completion of the $150 million stock repurchase agreement, $1.43 billion remains under our current authority.
see item 5, market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for share repurchases during the quarter ended november 27, 2015.
summary of stock repurchases for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013
(1)   stock repurchase agreements executed with large financial institutions. see stock repurchase program above.
off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations our principal commitments as of november 27, 2015 consist of obligations under operating leases, royalty agreements and various service agreements. see note 15 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our contractual commitments.
senior notes in january 2015, we issued the 2025 notes and settled the 2015 notes. as of november 27, 2015, our outstanding notes payable consists of the 2020 notes and 2025 notes with a total carrying value of $1.91 billion. at november 27, 2015, our maximum commitment for interest payments under the notes was $501.1 million for the remaining duration of our notes. in june 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 notes to a floating interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate ("libor") plus a fixed number of basis points through february 1, 2020.
covenants our credit facility and almaden tower lease contain a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. as of november 27, 2015, we were in compliance with all of our covenants. we believe these covenants will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. our notes do not contain any financial covenants.
under the terms of our credit agreement and lease agreements, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists. we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at november 27, 2015 was $258.7 million, exclusive of interest and penalties.
the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. these events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non-current assets and liabilities. we believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $10 million.
royalties we have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue.
indemnifications in the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.
to the extent permitted under delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity. the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director's or officer's lifetime. the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.

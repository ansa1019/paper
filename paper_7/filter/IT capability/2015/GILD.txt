2015 business highlights during 2015, we continued to advance our product pipeline across our therapeutic areas with the goal of delivering best-in-class drugs that advance the current standard of care and/or address unmet medical needs. highlights of our 2015 activities include:
•   u.s. food and drug administration (fda) and european commission approved genvoya for the treatment of hiv-1 infection. genvoya is our first tenofovir alafenamide (taf)-based regimen.
•   we submitted marketing applications to fda and european medicines agency (ema) for an investigational, once-daily single tablet regimen that combines our emtricitabine 200 mg and taf 25 mg with rilpivirine 25 mg (r/f/taf) from janssen sciences ireland uc, one of the janssen pharmaceutical companies of johnson &amp; johnson, for the treatment of hiv-1 infection in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older.
•   we submitted marketing applications to fda and ema for two doses of f/taf (200/10 mg and 200/25 mg) for the treatment of hiv-1 infection in adults and pediatric patients age 12 years and older, in combination with other hiv antiretroviral agents.
•   fda approved harvoni for expanded use in patients with genotype 4, 5 and 6 hcv infection and in patients co-infected with hiv. in addition, harvoni plus ribavirin for 12 weeks was approved as an alternate therapy to 24 weeks of harvoni for treatment-experienced, genotype 1 patients with cirrhosis.
•   japanese ministry of health, labour and welfare approved sovaldi for the suppression of viremia in patients with genotype 2 chronic hcv infection with or without compensated cirrhosis and harvoni, the first once-daily single-tablet regimen for the treatment of chronic hcv genotype 1 infection in adults with or without compensated cirrhosis, with a treatment duration of 12 weeks.
•   we submitted marketing applications to fda and ema for an investigational, once-daily fixed-dose combination of the nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir (sof) 400 mg and velpatasvir (vel) 100 mg, an investigational pan-genotypic ns5a inhibitor, for the treatment of genotype 1-6 chronic hcv infection.
•   we received reimbursement approval for sovaldi and harvoni in various countries in the european union.
•   fda approved the use of letairis (ambrisentan) in combination with tadalafil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) to reduce the risks of disease progression and hospitalization for worsening pah, and to improve exercise ability.
•   we filed a supplemental new drug application for the use of zydelig (idelalisib) in combination with ofatumumab in previously-treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
•   we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with galapagos nv, which became effective january 2016, for the development and commercialization of the jak1-selective inhibitor filgotinib for inflammatory disease indications. this collaboration represents an opportunity to add complementary clinical programs to our growing inflammation research and development efforts.
2015 financial highlights during 2015, total revenues increased to $32.6 billion and total product sales increased to $32.2 billion, compared to $24.9 billion and $24.5 billion respectively, in 2014, driven primarily by sales of harvoni and increased sales of our hiv single tablet regimen products, stribild, complera/eviplera and the recently launched genvoya, partially offset by decreased sales of sovaldi due to the uptake of harvoni. harvoni was approved in the united states in october 2014, in the european union in november 2014 and in japan in july 2015. for 2015, product sales in the u.s. were $21.2 billion compared to $18.1 billion in 2014. in europe, product sales were $7.2 billion compared to $5.1 billion in 2014. sales in other international locations were $3.8 billion in 2015 compared to $1.2 billion in 2014, primarily due to sales of sovaldi and harvoni in japan.
r&d expenses increased 6% to $3.0 billion for 2015 compared to 2014 due to continued investment in the progression and expansion of our product pipeline. selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses increased 15% to $3.4 billion for 2015 compared to 2014 due to increased costs to support our business expansion.
net income attributable to gilead for 2015 was $18.1 billion or $11.91 per diluted share, compared to $12.1 billion or $7.35 per diluted share in 2014, due primarily to the launch of harvoni, partially offset by the declines in sales of sovaldi and increases in operating expenses.
as of december 31, 2015, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $26.2 billion. during 2015, we generated $20.3 billion in operating cash flows, issued senior unsecured notes with a total aggregate principal amount of $10.0 billion (2015 notes), and paid $3.9 billion to settle 46 million warrants related to our convertible senior notes due may 2016. we repurchased 95 million shares of our common stock in 2015 for an aggregate amount of $10.0 billion. we also initiated a quarterly cash dividend of $0.43 per share in the second quarter of 2015, and paid a total of $1.9 billion in dividends to our shareholders in 2015.
in 2016, we will continue to focus on our key operating objectives which include the progression of our product pipeline and continued uptake of our commercial products. from a research and development (r&d) perspective, we will continue to invest in conducting new and ongoing clinical studies, which support both our existing products and our product candidates. we expect to move forward on a number of late-stage clinical studies for new product candidates and plan to file marketing applications for product candidates in various therapeutic areas.
from a commercial perspective, we will continue to focus on supporting the uptake of genvoya and prepare for additional anticipated launches of our new taf-based regimens, f/taf and r/f/taf, and continue to promote the use of our existing commercial products. in hcv, we will continue to focus on advancing care of people with the disease regardless of genotype or disease severity. sof/vel, if approved, would become the first and only regimen offering high sustained viral response rates with 12 weeks of treatment for patients with all hcv genotypes. we also plan to further build-out and expand our commercial infrastructure globally.
additionally, we will focus both on near term and longer term objectives to help many more patients around the world. our progress is subject to a number of uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the continuation of an uncertain global macroeconomic environment; adoption of additional pricing measures to reduce healthcare spending particularly in hcv; volatility in foreign currency exchange rates; inaccuracies in our hcv patient start estimates; additional competitive launches in hcv; an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing private and public payer negotiations; and a larger than anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments.

antiviral product sales, which include products in our hiv and liver disease areas, were $30.2 billion in 2015, $22.8 billion in 2014 and $9.3 billion in 2013. the sequential increases in antiviral product sales in 2015 and 2014 were driven primarily by the launch of sovaldi and harvoni. the increases in 2015 sales from the launch of harvoni across various geographies were partially offset by a year-over-year decline in sovaldi sales, with patients being prescribed harvoni instead of sovaldi. hiv products also contributed to sales increases in 2015 and 2014 primarily due to increased sales of our newer hiv single-tablet regimens, stribild, complera/eviplera and the recently launched genvoya, partially offset by declines in atripla sales volumes.
in 2015, approximately 34% of our product sales were generated outside the united states. we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in the euro and yen. we used foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a percentage of our foreign currency exposure. foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $737 million on our 2015 revenues compared to 2014 and a favorable impact of $39 million on our 2014 revenues compared to 2013.
we record product sales net of estimated mandatory and supplemental discounts to government payers, in addition to discounts to private payers, including rebates, chargebacks, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and other related costs. these deductions are generally referred to as gross-to-net deductions and totaled $18.1 billion or 36% of gross product sales in 2015, $7.3 billion or 23% in 2014 and $3.9 billion or 26% in 2013. of the $18.1 billion in 2015, $16.4 billion or 33% of gross product sales was related to government and other rebates and chargebacks, and $1.7 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and other related costs. as anticipated, our 2015 gross-to-net deductions attributable to our hcv product sales exceeded our overall gross-to-net of 36% in order to obtain formulary status or expand access for patients. as a result of the launch of competing regimens, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, increased pricing pressure.
the decline in gross-to-net deductions as a percentage of gross product sales in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to change in our payer mix reflecting a higher proportion of product sales to private payers compared to 2013 given the launch of sovaldi in december 2013 and harvoni in october 2014.
product sales in the united states increased by 17% to $21.2 billion in 2015 compared to $18.1 billion in 2014, primarily due to sales of harvoni and increases in sales of stribild, truvada and complera, partially offset by declines in sales of sovaldi. product sales in the united states increased by 173% in 2014 compared to $6.6 billion in 2013, primarily due to sales of sovaldi and harvoni and increases in sales of stribild and complera.
product sales in europe increased by 39% to $7.2 billion in 2015 compared to $5.1 billion in 2014, primarily due to sales of harvoni. product sales in europe increased by 54% to $5.1 billion in 2014 compared to $3.3 billion in 2013, primarily due to sales of sovaldi and increases in sales of eviplera and stribild. foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $611 million on our european product sales in 2015 compared to 2014 and a favorable impact of $72 million on our european product sales for 2014 compared to 2013.
since our hcv products, harvoni and sovaldi, were only recently launched, historical sales may not be indicative of future sales. in the united states, the number of hcv new patient starts has diminished since the first quarter of 2015, indicative of the rapid initiation of treatment for many warehoused patients, followed by a flattening of patients in the remaining quarters. we anticipate that the rate at which new patients start treatment in the second half of 2015 may be more indicative of the pace of new patient starts in 2016. in europe, we expect early launch markets to stabilize and new markets to ramp up treatment. in japan, patient numbers are difficult to predict because our hcv products were recently launched. additionally, we anticipate the government of japan will impose significant pricing discounts for harvoni and sovaldi that will start taking effect in the first half of 2016.
the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales:
(in millions, except percentages)                2015          change                2014          change                2013
* percentage not meaningful antiviral products the following is additional discussion of our results by product:
•   harvoni harvoni sales accounted for 46% and 9% of our total antiviral product sales for 2015 and 2014, respectively. harvoni was approved by fda in october 2014, by the european commission in november 2014 and by the japanese ministry of health, labour and welfare (mhlw) in july 2015. harvoni was approved as the first once-daily single tablet regimen for the treatment of chronic hcv genotype 1.
net product sales of harvoni in the united states were $10.1 billion in 2015 and $2.0 billion in 2014 driven by the product launch. net product sales of harvoni in europe were $2.2 billion in 2015 and $103 million in 2014. we launched harvoni in a number of countries including france, germany, u.k., italy and spain. net product sales of harvoni in other international locations were $1.6 billion in 2015 and $23 million in 2014, primarily due to the product launch in japan.
•   sovaldi sovaldi sales accounted for 17%, 45%, and 1% of our total antiviral product sales for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. sovaldi was approved by fda in december 2013, by the european commission in january 2014 and by japan in march 2015.
net product sales of sovaldi decreased by 49% to $5.3 billion in 2015 compared to $10.3 billion in 2014 primarily due to volume declines in the united states with patients being prescribed harvoni instead of sovaldi, partially offset by volume increases in japan and europe as we continue to launch sovaldi in various countries.
in 2015, net product sales of sovaldi were $2.4 billion in the united states, $1.6 billion in europe and $1.3 billion in other international locations, primarily japan. in 2014, net products sales of sovaldi were $8.5 billion in united states, $1.5 billion in europe and $230 million in other international locations.
•   truvada truvada sales accounted for 11%, 15% and 34% of our total antiviral product sales for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. truvada sales increased by 4% to $3.5 billion in 2015 compared to $3.3 billion in 2014 and by 7% in 2014 compared to $3.1 billion in 2013, primarily due to sales volume growth and an increase in the average net selling price in the united states.
in 2015, net product sales of truvada were $2.1 billion in the united states, $1.1 billion in europe and $284 million in other international locations. in 2014, net products sales of truvada were $1.8 billion in united states, $1.3 billion in europe and $278 million in other international locations. in 2013, net products sales of truvada were $1.6 billion in united states, $1.3 billion in europe and $270 million in other international locations.
•   atripla atripla sales accounted for 10%, 15% and 39% of our total antiviral product sales for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. atripla sales decreased 10% to $3.1 billion in 2015 compared to $3.5 billion 2014 and 5% in 2014 compared to $3.6 billion in 2013, primarily due to declines in volume as doctors prescribed newer treatments such as complera/eviplera and stribild. the efavirenz component of atripla, which has a gross margin of zero, comprised $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion of our atripla sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
in 2015, net product sales of atripla were $2.2 billion in the united states, $694 million in europe and $218 million in other international locations. in 2014, net products sales of atripla were $2.4 billion in united states, $888 million in europe and $225 million in other international locations. in 2013, net products sales of atripla were $2.4 billion in united states, $1.1 billion in europe and $231 million in other international locations.
a generic version of bristol-myers squibb company's sustiva (efavirenz), a component of atripla, was made available in canada and europe in 2013 and will be made available in the united states in 2017. while we have observed some pricing pressure related to the efavirenz component of our atripla sales, we have not yet observed any meaningful splitting of the atripla single tablet regimen.
•   stribild stribild sales accounted for 6%, 5% and 6% of our total antiviral product sales for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. stribild sales increased 52% to $1.8 billion in 2015 compared to $1.2 billion in 2014 and 122% compared to $539 million in 2013, primarily due to increased sales volume in the united states and europe.
in 2015, net product sales of stribild were $1.5 billion in the united states and $282 million in europe. in 2014, net products sales of stribild were $1.0 billion in united states and $145 million in europe. in 2013, net products sales of stribild were primarily attributable to sales in united states of $510 million.
•   complera/eviplera complera/eviplera sales accounted for 5%, 5% and 9% of our total antiviral product sales for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. complera/eviplera sales increased by16% to $1.4 billion in 2015 compared to $1.2 billion 2014 and 52% compared to $810 million in 2013 driven primarily by sales volume growth in the united states and europe.
in 2015, net product sales of complera/eviplera were $796 million in the united states and $576 million in europe. in 2014, net products sales of complera/eviplera were $663 million in united states and $513 million in europe. in 2013, net products sales of complera/eviplera were $503 million in united states and $268 million in europe.
•   viread viread sales accounted for 4%, 5%, 10% of our total antiviral product sales for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. viread sales increased 5% in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased 10% in 2014 compared to 2013 driven primarily by sales volume in the united states and other international locations.
in 2015, net product sales of viread were $541 million in the united states, $310 million in europe and $257 million in other international locations. in 2014, net products sales of viread were $484 million in united states, $336 million in europe and $238 million in other international locations. in 2013, net products sales of viread were $428 million in united states, $354 million in europe and $177 million in other international locations.
royalty, contract and other revenues the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty, contract and other revenues:
(in millions, except percentages)      2015                  change      2014                 change      2013
royalty, contract and other revenues primarily includes royalty revenues from f. hoffman-la roche ltd for sales of tamiflu. the majority of our royalties are recognized in the quarter following the quarter in which the corresponding product sales occur.
cost of goods sold and product gross margin the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales, cost of goods sold and product gross margin:
(in millions, except percentages)                2015          change                2014          change                2013
our product gross margin for 2015 increased compared to 2014 primarily due to changes in product mix, as atripla sales, which include the efavirenz component at a gross margin of zero, declined and hcv sales increased as a percentage of product sales. our product gross margin for 2014 increased compared to 2013 primarily due to changes in product mix, resulting from the launches of sovaldi and harvoni.
research and development expenses the following table summarizes the period over period changes in r&d expenses:
(in millions, except percentages)   2015                   change      2014                    change      2013
research and development                   $3,014       6        %            $2,854       35        %            $2,120
r&d expenses summarized above consist primarily of clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, materials and supplies, licenses and fees, milestone payments under collaboration arrangements, personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities-related costs.
we do not track total r&d expenses by product candidate, therapeutic area or development phase. however, we manage our r&d expenses by identifying the r&d activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources and other considerations. we continually review our r&d pipeline and the status of development and, as necessary, reallocate resources among the r&d portfolio that we believe will best support the future growth of our business.
personnel and infrastructure expenses           1,041                 900                 714
facilities, it and other costs                    339                 266                 259
in 2015, r&d expenses increased $160 million or 6% compared to 2014, primarily due to increases in personnel and infrastructure expenses of $141 million and facilities, it and other costs of $73 million to support our ongoing clinical study activity and geographic expansion. as discussed below, 2014 clinical studies and outside services included one-time items of $350 million for collaboration and acquisition related expenses and the purchase of a fda priority review voucher.
in 2014, r&d expenses increased $734 million or 35% compared to 2013, primarily due to an increase in clinical studies and outside services. the increase in clinical studies and outside services includes one-time items of $350 million for collaboration and acquisition related expenses and the purchase of a fda priority review voucher and $191 million for expenses related to the progression of clinical study activity, primarily in the oncology and hiv areas. personnel and infrastructure expenses increased $186 million to support our ongoing clinical study activity, geographic expansion and marketed product support.
in 2016, we expect r&d expenses to increase over 2015 to support the expansion of our clinical studies in various therapeutic areas including liver disease, hiv and inflammation.
selling, general and administrative expenses the following table summarizes the period over period changes in sg&a expenses:
(in millions, except percentages)     2015                    change      2014                    change      2013
sg&a expenses relate to sales and marketing, finance, human resources, legal and other administrative activities. expenses are primarily comprised of facilities and overhead costs, information technology infrastructure, outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses and other general and administrative costs. sg&a expenses also include the branded prescription drug (bpd) fee, enacted with the affordable care act in 2010.
in 2015, sg&a expenses increased $443 million or 15% compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase of $627 million in headcount-related, marketing and other expenses to support the growth and geographic expansion of our business, partially offset by a decrease in bpd fee expense of $100 million due to a change in estimate of our portion of the fee related to prior years.
in 2014, sg&a expenses increased $1.3 billion or 76% compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in headcount-related and other expenses of $542 million to support the ongoing growth and expansion of our business, including commercial expansion related to the launches of sovaldi and harvoni and an increase in bpd fee expense of $480 million. during 2014, the internal revenue service (irs) issued final regulations which accelerated the expense recognition criteria for the fee obligation from the year in which the fee is paid, to the year in which the market share used to allocate the fee is determined. as a result, we recognized $460 million in our 2014 sg&a expenses that would have previously been accrued in 2015.
in 2016, we expect sg&a expenses to increase compared to 2015 to support our continued build-out and expansion of our commercial infrastructure globally to support our products and to increase by an estimated $200 million for the bpd fee.
in 2014, interest expense increased to $412 million compared to $307 million in 2013. the increase was primarily a result of the issuance of the 2014 notes, offset by repayment of our senior unsecured notes issued in march and december 2011 (the 2011 notes) and conversion and maturity of our convertible senior notes due in may 2014 (the may 2014 notes) and partial conversion of our convertible senior notes due in may 2016 (the may 2016 notes, and collectively with the may 2014 notes, the may notes).
other income (expense), net other income (expense), net increased to $154 million in 2015 compared to $3 million in 2014 primarily due to higher interest income as the result of our portfolio earning a higher yield and higher cash balances. other income (expense), net was insignificant in 2014 and 2013.
provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes was $3.6 billion, $2.8 billion and $1.2 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the 2015 effective tax rate of 16.4% differed from the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to certain operating earnings from non-u.s. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested and tax credits, partially offset by state taxes, our portion of the non-tax deductible bpd fee and amortization expense of the intangible asset related to sofosbuvir for which we receive no tax benefit. we do not provide for u.s. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries.
the 2014 effective tax rate of 18.8% differed from the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to certain operating earnings from non-u.s. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested and tax credits, partially offset by state taxes, our portion of the non-tax deductible bpd fee and amortization expense of the intangible asset related to sofosbuvir for which we receive no tax benefit.
the 2013 effective tax rate of 27.3% differed from the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the retroactive extension of the 2012 federal research tax credit in january 2013, the 2013 federal research tax credit and certain operating earnings from non-u.s. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested, partially offset by state taxes, our portion of the non-tax deductible bpd fee, amortization expense of the intangible asset related to sofosbuvir and contingent consideration expense related to certain acquisitions for which we receive no tax benefit.
subsequent event galapagos we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with galapagos nv (galapagos), a clinical-stage biotechnology company based in belgium, for the development and commercialization of filgotinib, a jak1-selective inhibitor being investigated for inflammatory disease indications. under the terms of the agreement, which became effective on january 19, 2016, we made an upfront license fee payment of $300 million and a $425 million equity investment in galapagos. in addition, galapagos is eligible to receive development and regulatory milestone-based payments of up to $755 million, sales-based milestone payments of up to $600 million, tiered royalties on global sales and a profit split in potential co-promotion territories.
liquidity and capital resources we believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by our cash flows generated from operating activities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. the following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and working capital:
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities            $26,208             $11,726              $2,571
working capital                                             $14,872             $11,953                $590
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $26.2 billion at december 31, 2015, an increase of $14.5 billion or 124% when compared to $11.7 billion at december 31, 2014. during 2015, we generated $20.3 billion in cash flows from operations, received $9.9 billion in net proceeds from the 2015 notes and repurchased $10.0 billion of common stock. additionally, we utilized $3.9 billion to settle 46 million warrants related to the may 2016 notes (the 2016 warrants) and paid cash dividends of $1.9 billion.
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $11.7 billion at december 31, 2014, an increase of $9.2 billion or 356% when compared to $2.6 billion at december 31, 2013. during 2014, we generated $12.8 billion in cash flows from operations, received $7.9 billion from the issuance of the 2014 notes, repaid $2.3 billion in debt, net of convertible note hedges, repurchased $5.3 billion of common stock and paid approximately $4.1 billion to settle the warrants expiring in 2014 related to the may 2014 notes (the 2014 warrants).
of the total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at december 31, 2015, approximately $15.7 billion was generated from operations in foreign jurisdictions and is intended for use in our foreign operations. we do not rely on unrepatriated earnings as a source of funds for our domestic business as we expect to have sufficient cash flow and borrowing capacity in the united states to fund our domestic operational and strategic needs.
working capital working capital was $14.9 billion at december 31, 2015. the increase of $2.9 billion from working capital as of december 31, 2014 was driven primarily by the increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and an increase in accounts receivable, partially offset by increases in accrued government and other rebates.
working capital was $12.0 billion at december 31, 2014. the increase of $11.4 billion from working capital as of december 31, 2013 was driven primarily by positive cash flows from operations and an increase in cash and cash equivalents due to the issuance of the 2014 notes, partially offset by cash paid to settle convertible senior notes and the 2014 warrants, repayment of our bank debt, and repurchases of common stock.
cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flow activities:
operating activities                $20,329               $12,818             $3,105
investing activities                $(12,475      )       $(1,823     )       $(254       )
financing activities                $(4,963       )       $(3,025     )       $(2,544     )
cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities was $20.3 billion in 2015, consisting primarily of net income of $18.1 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $1.1 billion of depreciation and amortization expenses, $382 million for stock-based compensation expense and $1.2 billion of net cash inflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities. cash flows from operations may decrease in the future as we continue to make cash payments related to accrued government and other rebates.
cash provided by operating activities was $12.8 billion in 2014, consisting primarily of net income of $12.1 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $1.1 billion of depreciation and amortization expenses and $360 million of stock-based compensation expenses. this was partially offset by $518 million of net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities.
cash provided by operating activities was $3.1 billion in 2013, consisting primarily of net income of $3.1 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $345 million of depreciation and amortization expenses and $252 million of stock-based compensation expenses. this was partially offset by $562 million of net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities.
cash used in investing activities cash used in investing activities in 2015 was $12.5 billion, consisting primarily of $11.7 billion in net purchases of marketable securities and $747 million in capital expenditures related to the expansion of our business.
cash used in investing activities in 2014 was $1.8 billion, consisting primarily of $1.2 billion in net purchases of marketable securities and $557 million in capital expenditures related to the expansion of our business.
cash used in investing activities in 2013 was $254 million, consisting primarily of $379 million used in our acquisition of ym biosciences, net of cash acquired and $190 million of capital expenditures primarily related to construction in progress associated with new facilities at our headquarters to support the ongoing growth of our business. this was partially offset by $315 million of net proceeds from sales of marketable securities.
cash used in financing activities cash used in financing activities in 2015 was $5.0 billion, consisting primarily of $10.0 billion used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase programs, $3.9 billion used to settle 46 million of the 2016 warrants, and $1.9 billion used to pay dividends. these payments were primarily offset by $9.9 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of our 2015 notes.
cash used in financing activities in 2014 was $3.0 billion, consisting primarily of $2.3 billion used to repay debt, net of convertible notes hedges, $5.3 billion used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase programs and $4.1 billion to settle the 2014 warrants. these payments were primarily offset by $7.9 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of our 2014 notes.
cash used in financing activities in 2013 was $2.5 billion, consisting primarily of $4.4 billion used to repay debt financing which includes the maturity of our convertible senior notes due in may 2013 (the may 2013 notes) and conversions of our may notes, $1.0 billion to settle the warrants related to our may 2013 notes that settled in august 2013 and $582 million used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase program. this cash outflow was partially offset by proceeds of $2.8 billion related to our convertible note hedges.
debt and credit facility long-term obligations the summary of our borrowings under various financing arrangements is included in item 8, note 10 debt and credit facility in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
debt financing in september 2015, we issued our 2015 notes in the aggregate principal amount of $10.0 billion. in 2014, we issued our 2014 notes in the aggregate principal amount of $8.0 billion. the 2015 notes and 2014 notes were issued for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of debt, working capital, payment of dividends and the repurchase of our outstanding common stock pursuant to our authorized share repurchase programs.
convertible senior note repayments and warrant settlements during 2015, a portion of the may 2016 notes were settled and we repaid $213 million of principal balance related to these notes. we also paid $784 million in cash related to the conversion spread of the may 2016 notes, which represents the conversion value in excess of the principal amount, and received $784 million in cash from the convertible note hedges related to the may 2016 notes. in 2015, we entered into modified agreements with our warrant counterparties which changed the timing of the expiration for 46 million of the 2016 warrants. the agreements allowed us to settle the 46 million warrants at our option, in cash or shares. according to the terms of the agreements, these warrants expired during a 32 trading-day period which commenced on may 11, 2015 and ended on june 24, 2015. we exercised our option to settle in cash, and as a result, paid
$3.9 billion as the market value of our common stock at the time of the exercise of the warrants exceeded their strike prices.
during 2014, our may 2014 notes matured and a portion of our may 2016 notes was converted. during 2014, we repaid $912 million of principal balance relating to the may notes. we also paid $2.5 billion in cash related to the conversion spread of the may notes, which represents the conversion value in excess of the principal amount, and received $2.5 billion in cash from the convertible note hedges related to the may notes. in 2014, we exercised our option to settle in cash the 2014 warrants. as a result, we paid $4.1 billion to settle the warrants as the market value of our common stock at the time of the exercise of the warrants exceeded their strike price. there were 56 million shares of our common stock underlying the 2014 warrants, which had a strike price of $28.38 per share and expired during the 40 trading-day period commencing august 1, 2014 and ending on september 26, 2014.
as of december 31, 2015 we had $283 million of outstanding convertible senior notes. the notes will mature in may 2016, unless earlier repurchased or converted. the remaining 9 million outstanding 2016 warrants have a strike price of $28.76 per share, as adjusted for quarterly dividend distributions, and are due to expire during the 40 trading-day period commencing august 1, 2016. there were no other changes in terms for the remaining 9 million 2016 warrants.
credit facility in january 2012, we entered into a five-year $1.3 billion revolving credit facility credit agreement (the five-year revolving credit agreement) and borrowed $750 million thereunder. in 2013, we repaid $150 million under the five-year revolving credit agreement. during 2014, we repaid the remaining balance of $600 million that was outstanding. the five-year revolving credit agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative, negative and financial maintenance covenants and events of default. the loan bears interest at either (i) the eurodollar rate plus the applicable margin or (ii) the base rate plus the applicable margin, each as defined in the credit agreement. we may reduce the commitments and may prepay the loan in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. we are required to comply with certain covenants under the credit agreement and note indentures and as of december 31, 2015, we were not in violation of any covenants, and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility.
capital return program stock repurchase programs in january 2015, our board of directors authorized a five-year, $15.0 billion stock repurchase program (2015 program). the 2015 program commenced after the $5.0 billion stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in may 2014 was completed in the first quarter of 2015. the $5.0 billion repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in january 2011 was completed in 2014. as of december 31, 2015, the remaining authorized repurchase amount under the 2015 program was $8.0 billion.
in february 2016, our board of directors authorized a new $12.0 billion share repurchase program (2016 program) which will commence upon the completion of our 2015 program. purchases under the 2016 program may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
dividends in the second quarter of 2015, we began paying quarterly dividends on our common stock. during 2015, we paid cash dividends of $1.9 billion or $1.29 per share. on february 2, 2016, we announced that our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.43 per share of our common stock, with a payment date of march 30, 2016 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on march 16, 2016.
capital resources we believe our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash flows generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following:
•   the commercial performance of our current and future products;
•   the progress and scope of our r&amp;d efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials;
•   the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews;
•   the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities;
•   the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities;
•   the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products;
•   costs associated with the settlement and conversion of our convertible senior notes and related warrants;
•   the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and
•   costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of litigation and government investigations.
we may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. if such funding is required, we cannot guarantee that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all.
critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate and base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition product sales we recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. we record product sales net of estimated mandatory and supplemental discounts to government payers, in addition to discounts to private payers, and other related charges. these are generally referred to as gross-to-net deductions and are recorded in the same period the related sales occur. government and other rebates and chargebacks represent the majority of our gross-to-net deductions and require complex and significant judgment by management. estimates are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information.
government and other rebates and chargebacks government and other rebates and chargebacks include amounts paid to payers and healthcare providers in the united states, including medicaid rebates, adaps, veterans administration and public health service discounts, and other rebates, as well as foreign government rebates. rebates and chargebacks are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which may vary by product, by payer and individual payer plans.
for qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers or other distributors at a lower contractual price, the wholesalers or distributors charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual price. our consolidated allowances for government and other chargebacks that are payable to our direct customers are classified as reductions of accounts receivable, and totaled $907 million as of december 31, 2015 and $220 million as of december 31, 2014.
our consolidated allowance for government and other rebates that will be paid to parties other than our direct customers are recorded in accrued government and other rebates on our consolidated balance sheets, and totaled $4.1 billion as of december 31, 2015 and $2.3 billion as of december 31, 2014.
our allowances for government and other rebates and chargebacks are estimated based on products sold, historical utilization rates, pertinent third party industry information, estimated patient population, known market events or trends, channel inventory data and/or other market data. we also consider new information regarding changes in programs' regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates and/or our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs. we believe that the methodology that we use to estimate our government and other rebates and chargebacks is reasonable and appropriate given the current facts and circumstances. however, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. during the last three years, our actual government rebates and chargebacks claimed for prior periods have varied by less than 5% from our estimates.
the following table summarizes the consolidated activity in our government and other rebates and chargebacks accounts (in millions):
activity related to 2015 sales                                             $-                                      $16,400                  $(11,597      )                   $4,803
activity related to sales prior to 2015                                 2,536               7                                               (2,321        )                      222
activity related to 2014 sales                                             $-                                       $6,113                  $(3,650       )                   $2,463
activity related to sales prior to 2014                                 1,167                                         (109              )   (985          )                       73
the majority of the increase in accrued government and other rebates and chargebacks in 2015, compared to 2014, was driven by the increase in sales volume in 2015.
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. this allowance is based on our analysis of several factors, including, but not limited to, contractual payment terms, historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days sales outstanding by geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices. if the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. we believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate; however, significant deterioration in any of the above factors could materially change these expectations and may result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, our accounts receivable, net were $5.9 billion and $4.6 billion and our allowances for doubtful accounts were $65 million and $31 million, respectively.
valuation of intangible assets in conjunction with our business combinations, we have recorded intangible assets primarily related to in-process research and development (ipr&d) projects. we had total intangible assets of $10.2 billion as of december 31, 2015 and $11.1 billion as of december 31, 2014.
the identifiable intangible assets are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. the models used in valuing these intangible assets require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to:
•   estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates;
•   the probability of success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development;
•   the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates;
•   the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals; and
•   risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets.
we believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates.
intangible assets related to ipr&d projects are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated r&d efforts. if and when development is complete, which generally occurs if and when regulatory approval to market a product is obtained, the associated assets would be deemed finite-lived and would then be amortized based on their respective estimated useful lives at that point in time. during the period the assets are considered indefinite-lived, they will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment on an annual basis as well as between annual tests if we become aware of any events or changes that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the ipr&d projects below their respective carrying amounts. the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets is dependent on assumptions such as the expected timing or probability of achieving the specified milestones, changes in projected revenues or changes in discount rates. significant judgment is employed in determining these assumptions and changes to our assumptions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in any given period.
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives primarily on a straight-line basis. intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.
tax provision we estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. we evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. we consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.
if we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made.
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions including ireland. due to economic and political conditions, various countries are actively considering changes to existing tax laws. we cannot predict the form or timing of potential legislative changes that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.
we record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. we do not believe any such uncertain tax positions currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements, although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period.
at december 31, 2015 and 2014, we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $1.4 billion and $661 million, respectively. of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $1.3 billion and $602 million at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. as of december 31, 2015, we believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $7 million in the next 12 months as we expect to have clarification from the irs and other tax authorities regarding our uncertain tax positions. with respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authorities.
we file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the united states and abroad. for federal income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2010 and onwards. for certain acquired entities, the statute of limitations is open for all years from inception due to our utilization of their net operating losses and credits carried over from prior years. for california income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2010 and onwards.
our income tax returns are subject to audit by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. we are currently under examination by the irs for the 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. there are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. we periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions.
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of regulation s-k.
contractual obligations our contractual obligations consist of debt obligations, operating leases, capital commitments, purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory-related items and clinical trials contracts. the following table summarizes our significant enforceable and legally binding obligations, future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that certain of these obligations may be cancelable as of december 31, 2015 (in millions):
capital commitments (2)                 847                     387                     438                    22                         -
(1)   our debt obligations include senior unsecured notes and convertible senior notes. interest payments are incurred and calculated based on terms of the related notes. for further information, see item 8, note 10 debt and credit facility in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
(2)   at december 31, 2015, we had firm capital project commitments of approximately $847 million primarily relating to construction of new buildings.
(3)   at december 31, 2015, we had firm purchase commitments related to active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain inventory-related items. these amounts include minimum purchase requirements.
(4)   in addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration and development arrangements. payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and have not been included in the table above.
(5)   at december 31, 2015, we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to contract research organizations (cros). although all of our material contracts with cros are cancelable, we historically have not canceled such contracts. these amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or terminations of, existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts.
we had total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities including interest and penalties of $1.4 billion as of december 31, 2015. we believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $7 million in the next 12 months as we expect to have clarification from the irs and other tax authorities regarding our uncertain tax positions. with respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authorities. the unrecognized tax benefits were included in current and long-term income taxes payable and long-term deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheets and have not been included in the table above.
recent accounting pronouncements the information required by this item is included in item 8, note 1 organization and summary of significant accounting policies in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.

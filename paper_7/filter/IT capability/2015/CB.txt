overview through december 31, 2015, we operated through five business segments: insurance - north american p&c, insurance - north american agriculture, insurance - overseas general, global reinsurance, and life. for more information on our segments refer to "segment information" under item 1.
we have grown our business through increased premium volume, expansion of product offerings and geographic reach, and acquisitions of other companies. acquisitions in 2015, 2014, and 2013 are as follows:
•   the large corporate account property and casualty (p&amp;c) insurance business of itaú seguros (itaú seguros) (october 31, 2014);
•   the siam commercial samaggi insurance pcl (samaggi) (we and our local partner acquired 60.86 percent ownership on april 28, 2014, and subsequently acquired an additional 32.17 percent ownership through a mandatory tender offer, which expired on june 17, 2014);
the consolidated financial statements include results of acquired businesses from the acquisition dates.
on january 14, 2016, we completed the acquisition of the chubb corporation (chubb acquisition), a leading provider of middle-market commercial, specialty, surety, and personal insurance. together, we expect the combined company, which operates under the chubb brand, to be a global leader in commercial, specialty, and personal p&c insurance. the financial condition of the combined company, results of operations, liquidity, and capital resources are expected to materially change in 2016 and subsequent years.
refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our acquisitions.
our product and geographic diversification differentiates us from the vast majority of our competitors and has been a source of stability during periods of industry volatility. our long-term business strategy focuses on sustained growth in book value achieved through a combination of underwriting and investment income. by doing so, we provide value to our clients and shareholders through use of our substantial capital base in the insurance and reinsurance markets.
we are organized along a profit center structure by line of business and territory that does not necessarily correspond to corporate legal entities. profit centers can access various legal entities, subject to licensing and other regulatory rules. profit centers are expected to generate underwriting income and appropriate risk-adjusted returns. our corporate structure has facilitated the development of management talent by giving each profit center's senior management team the necessary autonomy within underwriting authorities to make operating decisions and create products and coverages needed by its target customer base. we are focused on delivering underwriting profit by only writing policies which we believe adequately compensate us for the risk we accept.
our insurance and reinsurance operations generate gross revenues from two principal sources: premiums and investment income. cash flow is generated from premiums collected and investment income received less paid losses and loss expenses, policy acquisition costs, and administrative expenses. invested assets are substantially held in liquid, investment grade fixed income securities of relatively short duration. claims payments in any short-term period are highly unpredictable due to the random nature of loss events and the timing of claims awards or settlements. the value of investments held to pay future claims is subject to market forces such as the level of interest rates, stock market volatility, and credit events such as corporate defaults. the actual cost of claims is also volatile based on loss trends, inflation rates, court awards, and catastrophes. we believe that our cash balance, our highly liquid investments, credit facilities, and reinsurance protection provide sufficient liquidity to meet unforeseen claim demands that might occur in the year ahead. refer to "liquidity" and "capital resources" for additional information.
•   net income was $2,834 million compared with $2,853 million last year.
•   total company net premiums written decreased 0.5 percent (increased 5.1 percent in constant dollars). net premiums written included $252 million from the transfer of the fireman's fund in-force business at the time of the transaction and will be non-recurring in 2016.
•   p&amp;c combined ratio was 87.4 percent compared with 87.7 percent in 2014. the gaap combined ratio was 87.3 percent compared with 88.1 percent in 2014.
•   the current accident year p&amp;c combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses was 88.8 percent compared with 89.3 percent in 2014.
•   the p&amp;c expense ratio was 29.2 percent compared with 29.4 percent in 2014.
•   total pre-tax and after-tax catastrophe losses including reinstatement premiums were $322 million (2.1 percentage points of the combined ratio) and $272 million, respectively, compared with $288 million (1.8 percentage points of the combined ratio) and $249 million, respectively, in 2014.
•   favorable prior period development pre-tax and after-tax were $546 million (3.5 percentage points of the combined ratio) and $474 million, respectively, compared with $527 million (3.4 percentage points of the combined ratio) and $459 million, respectively, in 2014.
•   operating cash flow was $3.9 billion compared with $4.5 billion in 2014. refer to "liquidity" for additional information on our cash flows.
•   net investment income was $2.2 billion compared with $2.3 billion in 2014, down 2.6 percent, primarily reflecting the negative impact of foreign exchange of $49 million.
•   shareholders' equity declined during the year, as net income was more than offset by the negative impact of unrealized losses in our investment portfolio and unfavorable foreign currency movement, together totaling $2 billion, after-tax, dividends on common shares, and share repurchases during the year.
•   the acquisition of the chubb corporation (chubb acquisition) for $29.5 billion was completed on january 14, 2016, and included $14.3 billion in cash (including proceeds from the issuance of $5.3 billion of senior notes in november 2015) and $15.2 billion in newly issued stock. in addition, we assumed outstanding equity awards to employees and directors with an attributed value of approximately $340 million.
•   integration expenses related to the chubb acquisition were $33 million, pre-tax, or $23 million, after-tax, in 2015 and include legal and professional fees and all costs directly related to the integration activities of the chubb acquisition.
all divisions contributed positively to net income in 2015, driven by excellent underwriting results resulting in a record low combined ratio and strong investment income, despite the adverse impact of foreign exchange. on a constant-dollar basis, net premiums written grew over 5 percent, primarily in north america, latin america, and asia, and net investment income declined less than one percent, despite historic low interest rates.
we completed the acquisition of the fireman's fund high net worth personal lines business in the u.s. and launched abr reinsurance ltd. (abr re), an independent reinsurance company. we own approximately 11.3 percent of the common equity of abr re's holding company. through long-term arrangements, chubb will be the sole source of reinsurance risks ceded to abr re. we also closed on our acquisition of the chubb corporation in january 2016 creating what we expect to be a global leader, operating under the chubb brand, in commercial p&c for customers of many sizes, a premier provider of personal lines to high net worth individuals and families in the u.s., and a global leader in professional lines, commercial, specialty, and a&h. our growth plans include new product capabilities into the middle market and agency channels. with respect to 2016 earnings of the combined entities, we estimate an investment income run rate for a full quarter of approximately $810 million to $825 million. we are now executing a detailed integration road map globally with integration plans on track including expense and growth-related initiatives. our expected expense synergy target at this time for the chubb acquisition is a $650 million annual run rate by the end of 2018. our current estimate of integration costs is $535
million with an additional $100 million in branding-related expenses. we plan to update these estimates at the end of the first quarter of 2016.
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements include amounts that, either by their nature or due to requirements of generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. (gaap), are determined using best estimates and assumptions. while we believe that the amounts included in our consolidated financial statements reflect our best judgment, actual amounts could ultimately materially differ from those currently presented. we believe the items that require the most subjective and complex estimates are:
•   future policy benefits reserves;
•   the valuation of value of business acquired (voba) and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and voba;
•   the valuation of derivative instruments related to guaranteed living benefits (glb); and we believe our accounting policies for these items are of critical importance to our consolidated financial statements. the following discussion provides more information regarding the estimates and assumptions required to arrive at these amounts and should be read in conjunction with the sections entitled: prior period development, asbestos and environmental (a&e), reinsurance recoverable on ceded reinsurance, investments, net realized and unrealized gains (losses), and other income and expense items.
unpaid losses and loss expenses as an insurance and reinsurance company, we are required by applicable laws and regulations and gaap to establish loss and loss expense reserves for the estimated unpaid portion of the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses under the terms of our policies and agreements with our insured and reinsured customers. at december 31, 2015, our gross unpaid loss and loss expense reserves were $37.3 billion and our net unpaid loss and loss expense reserves were $26.6 billion. with the exception of certain structured settlements, for which the timing and amount of future claim payments are reliably determinable, and certain reserves for unsettled claims that are discounted in statutory filings, our loss reserves are not discounted for the time value of money. in connection with such structured settlements and certain reserves for unsettled claims, we carried net discounted reserves of $92 million and $111 million at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
the estimate of the liabilities includes provisions for claims that have been reported but are unpaid at the balance sheet date (case reserves) and for obligations on claims that have been incurred but not reported (ibnr) at the balance sheet date. ibnr may also include provisions to account for the possibility that reported claims may settle for amounts that differ from the established case reserves. loss reserves also include an estimate of expenses associated with processing and settling unpaid claims (loss expenses). our loss reserves comprise approximately 85 percent casualty-related business, which typically encompasses long-tail risks and other risks where a high degree of judgment is required (see discussion below on reserving for long-tail business).
the process of establishing loss reserves for property and casualty claims can be complex and is subject to considerable uncertainty as it requires the use of informed estimates and judgments based on circumstances underlying the insured loss known at the date of accrual. for example, the reserves established for high excess casualty claims, asbestos and environmental claims, claims from major catastrophic events or for our various product lines each require different assumptions and judgments to be made. necessary judgments are based on numerous factors and may be revised as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed, as new or improved methods are developed, or as laws change. hence, ultimate loss payments may differ from the estimate of the ultimate liabilities made at the balance sheet date. changes to our previous estimates of prior period loss reserves impact the reported calendar year underwriting results, adversely if our estimates increase and favorably if our estimates decrease. the potential for variation in loss reserve estimates is impacted by numerous factors, which we discuss below (see also the section on reserving for long-tail business). reserve estimates for casualty lines are particularly uncertain given the lengthy reporting patterns and corresponding need for ibnr.
case reserves for those claims reported by insureds or ceding companies to us prior to the balance sheet date, and where we have sufficient information, are determined by our claims personnel as appropriate based on the circumstances of the claim(s), standard claim handling practices, and professional judgment. furthermore, for our brandywine run-off operations and our assumed reinsurance operation, global reinsurance, we may adjust the case reserves as notified by the ceding company via use of an additional case reserve if the judgment of our respective claims department differs from that of the cedant (see also the assumed reinsurance section below).
with respect to ibnr reserves, and those claims that have been incurred but not reported prior to the balance sheet date, there is, by definition, limited actual information to form the case reserve estimate and reliance is placed upon historical loss experience and actuarial methods to estimate the ultimate loss obligations and the corresponding amount of ibnr. ibnr reserve estimates are generally calculated by first projecting the ultimate amount of losses for a product line and subtracting paid losses and case reserves for reported claims. the judgments involved in projecting the ultimate losses may pertain to the use and interpretation of various standard actuarial reserving methods that place reliance on the extrapolation of actual historical data, loss development patterns, industry data, and other benchmarks as appropriate. the estimate of the required ibnr reserve also requires judgment by actuaries and management to reflect the impact of more contemporary and subjective factors, both qualitative and quantitative. among some of these factors that might be considered are changes in business mix or volume, changes in ceded reinsurance structures, changes in claims handling practices, reported and projected loss trends, inflation, the legal environment, and the terms and conditions of the contracts sold to our insured parties.
determining management's best estimate our recorded reserves represent management's best estimate of the provision for unpaid claims as of the balance sheet date. management's best estimate is developed after collaboration with actuarial, underwriting, claims, legal, and finance departments and culminates with the input of reserve committees. each business unit reserve committee includes the participation of the relevant parties from actuarial, finance, claims, and unit senior management and has the responsibility for finalizing, recommending and approving the estimate to be used as management's best estimate. reserves are further reviewed by chubb's chief actuary and senior management. the objective of such a process is to determine a single estimate that we believe represents a better estimate than any other and which is viewed by management to be the best estimate of ultimate loss settlements.
this estimate is generally based on a combination of exposure and experience based actuarial methods (described below) and other considerations such as claims reviews, reinsurance recovery assumptions and/or input from other subject matter experts such as underwriting. exposure-based methods are most commonly used on relatively immature origin years while experience-based methods provide a view based on the projection of loss experience that has emerged as of the valuation date. greater reliance is placed upon experience-based methods as the pool of emerging loss experience grows and where it is deemed sufficiently credible and reliable as the basis for the estimate. in comparing the held reserve for any given origin year to the actuarial projections, judgment is required as to the credibility, uncertainty and inherent limitations of applying actuarial techniques to historical data to project future loss experience. examples of factors that impact such judgments include, but are not limited to, the following:
•   nature and complexity of underlying coverage provided and net limits of exposure provided;
•   segmentation of data to provide sufficient homogeneity and credibility for loss projection methods;
•   historical variability of actual loss emergence compared with expected loss emergence;
•   rate monitor information for new and renewal business;
we do not calculate ranges of loss reserve estimates for our individual loss reserve studies, given the lack of robust statistical approaches and the limited usefulness for such information in decision making. determining such ranges is a complex and uncertain process, and such ranges generally do not capture the potential changes in external and internal circumstances between the balance sheet date and the final settlement date that may impact the ultimate value of loss. while we believe that our recorded reserves are reasonable and represent management's best estimate for each product line as of the current valuation date, future changes to our view of the ultimate liabilities are possible. a five percent change in our net loss reserves equates to $1.3 billion and represents five percent of shareholders' equity at december 31, 2015. historically our reserves, at times, have developed in excess of 10 percent of recorded amounts. refer to "analysis of losses and loss expenses development", under item 1, for a summary of historical volatility between estimated loss reserves and ultimate loss settlements.
we have actuarial staff within each of our business units who analyze loss reserves and regularly project estimates of ultimate losses and the corresponding indications of the required ibnr reserve. note that losses include loss expenses for the purposes of this discussion. we perform an actuarial reserve review for each product line at least once a year. at the conclusion of each review, we establish an actuarial central estimate. the process to select the actuarial central estimate, when more than one estimate is available, may differ across product lines. for example, an actuary may base the central estimate on loss projections developed using an incurred loss development approach instead of a paid loss development approach when reported losses are viewed to be a more credible indication of the ultimate loss compared with paid losses. the availability of estimates for different projection techniques will depend upon the product line, the underwriting circumstances, and the maturity of the loss emergence. for a well-established product line with sufficient volume and history and low volatility, the actuarial central estimate may be drawn from a weighting of paid and reported loss development and/or bornhuetter-ferguson methods (described below). however, for a new long-tail product line for which we have limited data and experience, a rapidly growing line, or an established line with volatile experience, the emerging loss experience may not have sufficient credibility to allow selection of loss development or bornhuetter-ferguson methods and reliance may be placed upon the expected loss ratio method (described below) until the experience matures and becomes credible.
typically, for each product line, one or more standard actuarial reserving methods may be used to estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses, and from these estimates, a single actuarial central estimate is selected. exceptions to the use of standard actuarial projection methods occur for individual claims of significance that require complex legal, claims, and actuarial analysis and judgment (for example, a&e account projections or high excess casualty/professional lines accounts in litigation) or for product lines where the nature of the claims experience and/or availability of the data prevent application of such standard methods. in addition, claims arising from certain catastrophic events require evaluations that do not utilize standard actuarial loss projection methods but are based upon our exposure at the time of the event and the circumstances of the catastrophe and its post-event impact.
in addition to the annual loss reserve studies performed for each product line, we review the emergence of actual losses relative to expectations for most product lines each quarter. if warranted from findings in loss emergence tests, we may alter the timing of our product line reserve studies. finally, loss reserve studies are performed annually by external third-parties and the findings are used to provide management an independent assessment of our internal findings.
standard actuarial reserving methods standard actuarial reserving methods include, but are not limited to, expected loss ratio, paid and reported loss development, and bornhuetter-ferguson methods. a general description of these methods is provided below. in the subsequent discussion on short-tail and long-tail business, reference is also made, where appropriate, to how consideration in method selection impacted 2015 results. in addition to these standard methods, depending upon the product line characteristics and available data we may use other recognized actuarial methods and approaches. to ensure that the projections of future loss emergence based on historical loss development patterns are representative of the underlying business, historical loss and premium data is required to be of sufficient homogeneity and credibility. for example, to improve data homogeneity, we may subdivide product line data further by similar risk attribute (e.g., geography, coverage such as property versus liability exposure, or elements of program structure such as attachments or limits), project ultimate losses for these homogeneous groups and then combine the results to provide the overall product line estimate. the premium and loss data are aggregated by origin year (e.g., the year in which the losses were incurred - "accident year" or "report year") and annual or quarterly development periods, and data at all valuations is converted at the same foreign exchange rates in order to avoid distortions from exchange rate movements over time. implicit in the standard actuarial methods that we generally utilize is the need for two fundamental assumptions: first, the pattern by which losses are expected to emerge over time for each origin year, and second the expected loss ratio for each origin year.
the expected loss ratio for any particular origin year is selected after consideration of a number of factors, including historical loss ratios adjusted for rate changes, premium and loss trends, industry benchmarks, the results of policy level loss modeling at the time of underwriting, and/or other more subjective considerations for the product line (e.g., terms and conditions) and external environment as noted above. the expected loss ratio for a given origin year is initially established at the start of the origin year as part of the planning process. this analysis is performed in conjunction with underwriters and management. the expected loss ratio method arrives at an ultimate loss estimate by multiplying the expected ultimate loss ratio by the corresponding premium base. this method is most commonly used as the basis for the actuarial central estimate for immature origin periods on product lines where the actual paid or reported loss experience is not yet deemed sufficiently credible to serve as the principal basis for the selection of ultimate losses. the expected loss ratio for a given origin year may be modified over time if the underlying assumptions differ from the original assumptions (for example, the assessment of prior year loss ratios, loss trend, rate changes, actual claims, or other information).
our selected paid and reported development patterns provide a benchmark against which the actual emerging loss experience can be monitored. where possible, development patterns are selected based on historical loss emergence by origin year with appropriate allowance for changes in business mix, claims handling process, and/or ceded reinsurance that are likely to lead to a discernible difference between the rate of historical and future loss emergence. for product lines where the historical data is viewed to have low statistical credibility, the selected development patterns also reflect relevant industry benchmarks and/or experience from similar product lines written elsewhere within chubb. this most commonly occurs for relatively new product lines that have limited historical data or for high severity/low frequency portfolios where our historical experience exhibits considerable volatility and/or lacks credibility. the paid and reported loss development methods convert the selected loss emergence pattern to a set of multiplicative factors which are then applied to actual paid or reported losses to arrive at an estimate of ultimate losses for each period. due to their multiplicative nature, the paid and reported loss development methods will leverage differences between actual and expected loss emergence. these methods tend to be utilized for more mature origin periods and for those portfolios where the loss emergence has been relatively consistent over time.
the bornhuetter-ferguson method is essentially a combination of the expected loss ratio method and the loss development method, where the loss development method is given more weight as the origin year matures. this approach allows a logical transition between the expected loss ratio method which is generally utilized at earlier maturities and the loss development methods which are typically utilized at later maturities. we usually apply this method using reported loss data although paid data may also be used.
the applicability of actuarial methods will also be impacted by the attachment point of the policy or contract with the insured or ceding company. in the case of low attachment points typical of primary insurance or working layer reinsurance, the experience tends to be more frequency driven. for these product types, standard actuarial methods are generally applicable in determining loss reserve levels given sufficient history and credible loss experience (although still subject to the same limitations and uncertainties described elsewhere in this section, for example, changing inflationary or legal environments). in the case of high attachment points typical of excess insurance or excess of loss reinsurance, the experience tends to be severity driven, as only a loss of significant size will enter the layer. for these product lines, it typically takes longer for loss experience to gain credibility, which adds uncertainty to the estimates derived from standard actuarial methods. for products such as our assumed reinsurance business, we typically supplement the standard actuarial methods with an analysis of each contract's terms, original pricing information, subsequent internal and external analyses of the ongoing contracts, market exposures and history, and qualitative input from claims managers. this approach is also used for structured or unique contracts.
short-tail and long-tail business the time period between the date of loss occurrence and the final payment date of the ensuing claim(s) is referred to as the "claim-tail." the following is a discussion of specific reserving considerations for both short-tail and long-tail product lines. in this section, we reference the nature of recent prior period development to give a high-level understanding of how these considerations translate through the reserving process into financial decisions. refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on prior period development.
short-tail business short-tail business generally describes product lines for which losses are typically known and paid shortly after the loss actually occurs. this would include, for example, most property, personal accident, aviation hull, and automobile physical damage policies that we write. there are some exceptions on certain product lines or events (e.g., major hurricanes or aviation crashes) where the event has occurred, but the final settlement amount is highly uncertain (e.g., coverage disputes or liability-related claims) and not known with certainty for a potentially lengthy period. due to the short reporting and development pattern for these product lines, the uncertainty associated with our estimate of ultimate losses for any particular accident period diminishes relatively quickly as actual loss experience emerges. we typically assign credibility to methods that incorporate actual loss emergence, such as the paid and reported loss development and bornhuetter-ferguson methods, sooner than would be the case for long-tail lines at a similar stage of development for a given origin year. the reserving process for short-tail losses arising from catastrophic events typically involves an assessment by the claims department, in conjunction with underwriters and actuaries, of our exposure and estimated losses immediately following an event and then subsequent revisions of the estimated losses as our insureds provide updated actual loss information.
for origin year 2015, loss reserves for short-tail lines were typically established for the non-catastrophe exposures using a combination of the initial expected loss ratio method (see above) and loss development methods that incorporate actual loss emergence. as the year progressed, we also adjusted these reserves for non-catastrophe large loss activity that we considered to be greater or less than the assumptions used to establish the initial expected loss ratio. catastrophe activity was relatively low in 2015 and accordingly the judgments and uncertainties used to establish reserves for incurred catastrophe events were correspondingly less complex. for our short-tail businesses taken as a whole, overall loss trend assumptions did not differ significantly relative to prior years.
long-tail business long-tail business describes lines of business for which specific losses may not be known/reported for some period and for which claims can take significant time to settle/close. this includes most casualty lines such as general liability, d&o, and workers' compensation. there are various factors contributing to the uncertainty and volatility of long-tail business. among these are:
•   the nature and complexity of underlying coverage provided and net limits of exposure provided;
•   our historical loss data and experience is sometimes too immature and lacking in credibility to rely upon for reserving purposes. where this is the case, in our reserve analysis we may utilize industry loss ratios or industry benchmark development patterns that we believe reflect the nature and coverage of the underwritten business and its future development, where available. for such product lines, actual loss experience may differ from industry loss statistics as well as loss experience for previous underwriting years;
•   the considerable inherent uncertainty around loss trends, claims inflation (e.g., medical and judicial) and underlying economic conditions;
•   loss reserve analyses typically require loss or other data be grouped by common characteristics in some manner. if data from two combined lines of business exhibit different characteristics, such as loss payment patterns, the credibility of the reserve estimate could be affected. additionally, since casualty lines of business can have significant intricacies in the terms and conditions afforded to the insured, there is an inherent risk as to the homogeneity of the underlying data used in performing reserve analyses; and
•   the applicability of the price change data used to estimate ultimate loss ratios for most recent origin years.
as can be seen from the above, various factors are considered when determining appropriate data, assumptions, and methods used to establish the loss reserve estimates for long-tail product lines. these factors may also vary by origin year for given product lines. the derivation of loss development patterns from data and the selection of a tail factor to project ultimate losses from actual loss emergence require considerable judgment, particularly with respect to the extent to which historical loss experience is relied upon to support changes in key reserving assumptions. examples of the relationship between changes in historical loss experience and key reserving assumptions are provided below.
for those long-tail product lines that are less claim frequency and more claim severity oriented, such as high excess professional and casualty lines, we placed more reliance upon expert legal and claims review of the specific circumstances underlying reported cases rather than loss development patterns. where appropriate, we then supplemented this with loss development and bornhuetter-ferguson approaches to provide for claims that have been reported but are too immature to develop individual claims estimates and also to provide for claims that have occurred but have not been reported. the assumptions used for these lines of business are updated over time to reflect new claim and legal advice judged to be of significance.
our assumptions on loss trend and development patterns reflect reliance on our historical loss data provided the length and volume of history and homogeneity afford credibility. for those lines where our internal historical experience lacks credibility, we may place reliance upon the latest benchmark patterns (where available) from external industry bodies such as insurance services office (iso) or the national council on compensation insurance, inc. (ncci). in such cases, the assumptions used to project ultimate loss estimates will not fully reflect our own actual loss experience until our data is deemed sufficiently credible. we note that industry patterns are not always available to match the nature of the business being written; this issue is particularly problematic for non-u.s. exposed lines. given the underlying volatility of the long-tail product lines and the lengthy period required for full paid and reported loss emergence, we typically assign little to no credibility to actual loss emergence that is lower than expected in the early development periods. accordingly, we generally used the expected loss ratio method for the 2015 and immediately preceding origin years to establish reserves by product line. we monitor actual paid and reported loss emergence relative to expected loss emergence for most individual product lines.
for long-tail portfolios where actual loss emergence in calendar year 2015 was lower than expected for the more recent origin years, the deviation was not typically seen as sufficiently credible, particularly given the volatility and lengthy period for full loss emergence, to fully reflect in our booked ultimate loss selections or the actuarial assumptions underlying the reserve reviews. however, for certain product lines with early loss emergence on more recent origin years that was greater than expected, we did respond where we believed that such adverse emergence was generally significant relative to the loss emergence assumptions (e.g., origin years 2012 and 2014 for casualty and financial lines in insurance - overseas general). such judgments were made with due consideration to the factors impacting reserve uncertainty as discussed above. the reserve actions that we took in 2015 are discussed further below and in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
for more mature origin years, typically 2011 and prior, we gave meaningful weight to indicated ultimates derived from methods that rely on the paid and reported loss development patterns based on our own historical experience where sufficient credibility was deemed to exist. as noted previously, this is consistent with our practice of allowing favorable loss emergence sufficient time to be reliably established before assigning partial or full credibility.
the prior period development in 2015 for long-tail lines of business comprised several main components. first, we experienced favorable prior period development on a number of product lines where actual loss emergence was lower than expected and/or increased weighting was given to experience-based methods as relevant origin years mature (typically 2011 and prior). in particular, this included management and professional liability portfolios, and auto liability excess and general liability portfolios, in insurance - north american p&c ($166 million favorable) principally in origin years 2009 through 2011, casualty and financial lines in insurance - overseas general for origin years 2011 and prior ($175 million favorable), and origin years 2010 and prior for long-tail product lines in global reinsurance ($64 million favorable). second, we recorded reserve actions in response to development on specific large claims. third, we experienced adverse development from insurance - north american p&c run-off operations including westchester and brandywine run-off operations ($200 million). the causes for the westchester and brandywine operations are described further below.
sensitivity to underlying assumptions while we believe that our reserve for unpaid losses and loss expenses at december 31, 2015, is adequate, new information or emerging trends that differ from our assumptions may lead to future development of losses and loss expenses that is significantly greater or less than the recorded reserve, which could have a material effect on future operating results. as noted previously, our best estimate of required loss reserves for most portfolios is judgmentally selected for each origin year after considering the results from a number of reserving methods and is not a purely mechanical process. therefore, it is difficult to convey, in a simple and quantitative manner, the impact that a change to a single assumption will have on our best estimate. in the examples below, we attempt to give an indication of the potential impact by isolating a single change for a specific reserving method that would be pertinent in establishing the best estimate for the product line described. we consider each of the following sensitivity analyses to represent a reasonably likely deviation in the underlying assumption.
tail factor (i.e., 1.04 changed to either 1.05 or 1.03) would cause a change of approximately $470 million, either positive or negative, for the projected net loss and loss expense reserves. this represents an impact of 10 percent relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately $4.6 billion.
the reserve portfolio for our ace bermuda operations contains exposure to predominantly high excess liability coverage on an occurrence-first-reported basis (typically with attachment points in excess of $325 million and gross limits of up to $150 million) and d&o and other professional liability coverage on a claims-made basis (typically with attachment points in excess of $125 million and gross limits of up to $75 million). due to the layer of exposure covered, the expected frequency for this book is very low. as a result of the low frequency/high severity nature of the book, a small difference in the actual vs. expected claim frequency, either positive or negative, could result in a material change to the projected ultimate loss if such change in claim frequency was related to a policy where close to maximum limits were deployed.
insurance - north american agriculture approximately 69 percent of the reserves for this segment are from the crop related lines, which all have short payout patterns, with the majority of the liabilities expected to be resolved in the ensuing twelve months. reserves for our multiple peril crop insurance (mpci) product are set on a case-by-case basis and our aggregate exposure is subject to state level risk sharing formulae as well as third-party reinsurance. the majority of the development risk arises out of the accuracy of case reserve estimates. we do not view our agriculture reserves as substantially influenced by the general assumptions and risks underlying more typical p&c reserve estimates.
insurance - overseas general certain long-tail lines, such as casualty and professional lines, are particularly susceptible to changes in loss trend and claim inflation.  heightened perceptions of tort and settlement awards around the world are increasing the demand for these products as well as contributing to the uncertainty in the reserving estimates.  our reserving methods rely on loss development patterns estimated from historical data and while we attempt to adjust such factors for known changes in the current tort environment, it is possible that such factors may not entirely reflect all recent trends in tort environments.  for example, when applying the reported loss development method, the lengthening of our selected loss development patterns by six months would increase reserve estimates on long-tail casualty and professional lines for accident years 2013 and prior by approximately $262 million. this represents an impact of 12.4 percent relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately $2.1 billion.
global reinsurance typically, there is inherent uncertainty around the length of paid and reported development patterns, especially for certain casualty lines such as excess workers' compensation or general liability, which may take up to 30 years to fully develop.  this uncertainty is accentuated by the need to supplement client development patterns with industry development patterns due to the sometimes low credibility of the data. the underlying source and selection of the final development patterns can thus have a significant impact on the selected ultimate net losses and loss expenses. for example, a 20 percent shortening or lengthening of the development patterns used for u.s. long-tail lines would cause the loss reserve estimate derived by the reported bornhuetter-ferguson method for these lines to change by approximately $446 million. this represents an impact of 45 percent relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately $1.0 billion.
for catastrophe business, we principally estimate unpaid losses and loss expenses on an event basis by considering various sources of information, including specific loss estimates reported by our cedants, ceding company and overall industry loss estimates reported by our brokers, and our internal data regarding reinsured exposures related to the geographical location of the event. our internal data analysis enables us to establish catastrophe reserves for known events with more certainty at an earlier date than would be the case if we solely relied on reports from third parties to determine carried reserves.
for our casualty reinsurance business, we generally rely on ceding companies to report claims and then use that data as a key input to estimate unpaid losses and loss expenses. due to the reliance on claims information reported by ceding companies, as well as other factors, the estimation of unpaid losses and loss expenses for assumed reinsurance includes certain risks and uncertainties that are unique relative to our direct insurance business. these include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:
•   typically, a lag exists between the reporting of a loss event to a ceding company and its reporting to us as a reinsurance claim. the use of a broker to transmit financial information from a ceding company to us increases the reporting lag. because most of our reinsurance business is produced by brokers, ceding companies generally first submit claim and other financial information to brokers, who then report the proportionate share of such information to each reinsurer of a particular treaty. the reporting lag generally results in a longer period of time between the date a claim is incurred and the date a claim is reported compared with direct insurance operations. therefore, the risk of delayed recognition of loss reserve development is higher for assumed reinsurance than for direct insurance lines; and
•   the historical claims data for a particular reinsurance contract can be limited relative to our insurance business in that there may be less historical information available. further, for certain coverages or products, such as excess of loss contracts, there may be relatively few expected claims in a particular year so the actual number of claims may be susceptible to significant variability. in such cases, the actuary often relies on industry data from several recognized sources.
we mitigate the above risks in several ways. in addition to routine analytical reviews of ceding company reports to ensure reported claims information appears reasonable, we perform regular underwriting and claims audits of certain ceding companies to ensure reported claims information is accurate, complete, and timely. as appropriate, audit findings are used to adjust claims in the reserving process. we also use our knowledge of the historical development of losses from individual ceding companies to adjust the level of adequacy we believe exists in the reported ceded losses.
on occasion, there will be differences between our carried loss reserves and unearned premium reserves and the amount of loss reserves and unearned premium reserves reported by the ceding companies.  this is due to the fact that we receive consistent and timely information from ceding companies only with respect to case reserves.  for ibnr, we use historical experience and other statistical information, depending on the type of business, to estimate the ultimate loss.  we estimate our unearned premium reserve by applying estimated earning patterns to net premiums written for each treaty based upon that treaty's coverage basis (i.e., risks attaching or losses occurring).  at december 31, 2015, the case reserves reported to us by our ceding companies were $723 million, compared with the $740 million we recorded.  our policy is to post additional case reserves in addition to the amounts reported by our cedants when our evaluation of the ultimate value of a reported claim is different than the evaluation of that claim by our cedant.
within the insurance - north american p&c segment, we also have exposure to certain liability reinsurance lines that have been in run-off since 1994. unpaid losses and loss expenses relating to this run-off reinsurance business resides within the brandywine division of our insurance - north american p&c segment. most of the remaining unpaid loss and loss expense reserves for the run-off reinsurance business relate to a&e claims. refer to the "asbestos and environmental (a&e)" section for additional information.
asbestos and environmental reserves included in our liabilities for losses and loss expenses are amounts for a&e (a&e liabilities). the a&e liabilities principally relate to claims arising from bodily-injury claims related to asbestos products and remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites. the estimation of our a&e liabilities is particularly sensitive to future changes in the legal, social, and economic environment. we have not assumed any such future changes in setting the value of our a&e liabilities, which include provisions for both reported and ibnr claims.
there are many complex variables that we consider when estimating the reserves for our inventory of asbestos accounts and these variables may directly impact the predicted outcome. we believe the most significant variables relating to our a&e liabilities include the current legal environment; specific settlements that may be used as precedents to settle future claims; assumptions regarding trends with respect to claim severity and the frequency of higher severity claims; assumptions regarding the ability to allocate liability among defendants (including bankruptcy trusts) and other insurers; the ability of a claimant to bring a claim in a state in which they have no residency or exposure; the ability of a policyholder to claim the right to unaggregated coverage; whether high-level excess policies have the potential to be accessed given the policyholder's claim trends and liability situation; payments to unimpaired claimants; and, the potential liability of peripheral defendants. based on the policies, the facts, the law, and a careful analysis of the impact that these factors will likely have on any given account, we estimate the potential liability for indemnity, policyholder defense costs, and coverage litigation expense.
the results in asbestos cases announced by other carriers or defendants may well have little or no relevance to us because coverage exposures are highly dependent upon the specific facts of individual coverage and resolution status of disputes among carriers, policyholders, and claimants.
for additional information refer to the "asbestos and environmental (a&e)" section and to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
future policy benefits reserves we issue contracts in our insurance - overseas general and life segments that are classified as long-duration.  these contracts generally include accident and supplemental health products, term and whole life products, endowment products, and annuities.  in accordance with gaap, we establish reserves for contracts determined to be long-duration based on approved actuarial methods that include assumptions related to expenses, mortality, morbidity, persistency, and investment yields with a factor for adverse deviation.  these assumptions are "locked in" at the inception of the contract, meaning we use our original assumptions throughout the life of the policy and do not subsequently modify them unless we deem the reserves to be inadequate. the future policy benefits reserves balance is regularly evaluated for a premium deficiency. if experience is less favorable than assumptions, additional liabilities may be required, resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims.
valuation of value of business acquired (voba) and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and voba as part of the acquisition of businesses that sell long-duration contracts, such as life products, we established an intangible asset related to voba, which represented the fair value of the future profits of the in-force contracts. the valuation of voba at the time of acquisition is derived from similar assumptions to those used to establish the associated future policy benefits reserves.  the most significant input in this calculation is the discount rate used to arrive at the present value of the net cash flows.  we amortize deferred policy acquisition costs associated with long-duration contracts and voba (collectively policy acquisition costs) over the estimated life of the contracts, generally in proportion to premium revenue recognized based upon the same assumptions used in estimating the liability for future policy benefits. for non-traditional long-duration contracts, we amortize policy acquisition costs over the expected life of the contracts in proportion to estimates of expected gross profits. the estimated life is established at the inception of the contracts or upon acquisition and is based on current persistency assumptions.  policy acquisition costs, which consist of commissions, premium taxes, and certain underwriting costs related directly to the successful acquisition of a new or renewal insurance contract, are reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from future income, including investment income. unrecoverable costs are expensed in the period identified.
risk transfer in the ordinary course of business, we both purchase (or cede) and sell (or assume) reinsurance protection. we discontinued the purchase of all finite risk reinsurance contracts, as a matter of policy, in 2002. for both ceded and assumed reinsurance, risk transfer requirements must be met in order to use reinsurance accounting, principally resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract as premiums and losses. if risk transfer requirements are not met, a contract is to be accounted for as a deposit, typically resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract through a deposit asset or liability and not as revenue or expense. to meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance contract must include both insurance risk, consisting of underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity. we also apply similar risk transfer requirements to determine whether certain commercial insurance contracts should be accounted for as insurance or a deposit. contracts that include fixed premium (i.e., premium not subject to adjustment based on loss experience under the contract) for fixed coverage generally transfer risk and do not require judgment.
reinsurance and insurance contracts that include both significant risk sharing provisions, such as adjustments to premiums or loss coverage based on loss experience, and relatively low policy limits, as evidenced by a high proportion of maximum premium assessments to loss limits, can require considerable judgment to determine whether or not risk transfer requirements are met. for such contracts, often referred to as finite or structured products, we require that risk transfer be specifically assessed for each contract by developing expected cash flow analyses at contract inception. to support risk transfer, the cash flow analyses must demonstrate that a significant loss is reasonably possible, such as a scenario in which the ratio of the net present value of losses divided by the net present value of premiums equals or exceeds 110 percent. for purposes of cash flow analyses, we generally use a risk-free rate of return consistent with the expected average duration of loss payments. in addition, to support insurance risk, we must prove the reinsurer's risk of loss varies with that of the reinsured and/or support various scenarios under which the assuming entity can recognize a significant loss.
to ensure risk transfer requirements are routinely assessed, qualitative and quantitative risk transfer analyses and memoranda supporting risk transfer are developed by underwriters for all structured products. we have established protocols for structured products that include criteria triggering an accounting review of the contract prior to quoting. if any criterion is triggered, a contract must be reviewed by a committee established by each of our segments with reporting oversight, including peer review, from our global structured transaction review committee.
with respect to ceded reinsurance, we entered into a few multi-year excess of loss retrospectively-rated contracts, principally in 2002. these contracts primarily provided severity protection for specific product divisions. because traditional one-year reinsurance coverage had become relatively costly, these contracts were generally entered in order to secure a more cost-effective reinsurance program. all of these contracts transferred risk and were accounted for as reinsurance. in addition, we maintain a few aggregate excess of loss reinsurance contracts that were principally entered into prior to 2003, such as the national indemnity company (nico) contracts referred to in the section entitled, "asbestos and environmental (a&e)". we have not purchased any other retroactive ceded reinsurance contracts since 1999.
with respect to assumed reinsurance and insurance contracts, products giving rise to judgments regarding risk transfer were primarily sold by our financial solutions business. although we have significantly curtailed writing financial solutions business, several contracts remain in-force and principally include multi-year retrospectively-rated contracts and loss portfolio transfers. because transfer of insurance risk is generally a primary client motivation for purchasing these products, relatively few insurance and reinsurance contracts have historically been written for which we concluded that risk transfer criteria had not been met. for certain insurance contracts that have been reported as deposits, the insured desired to self-insure a risk but was required, legally or otherwise, to purchase insurance so that claimants would be protected by a licensed insurance company in the event of non-payment from the insured.
reinsurance recoverable reinsurance recoverable includes balances due to us from reinsurance companies for paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses and is presented net of a provision for uncollectible reinsurance. the provision for uncollectible reinsurance is determined based upon a review of the financial condition of the reinsurers and other factors. ceded reinsurance contracts do not relieve our primary obligation to our policyholders. consequently, an exposure exists with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer is unable or unwilling to meet its obligations or disputes the liabilities assumed under the reinsurance contracts. we determine the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses using actuarial estimates as well as a determination of our ability to cede unpaid losses and loss expenses under existing reinsurance contracts.
the recognition of a reinsurance recoverable asset requires two key judgments. the first judgment involves our estimation based on the amount of gross reserves and the percentage of that amount which may be ceded to reinsurers. ceded ibnr, which is a major component of the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses, is generally developed as part of our loss reserving process and, consequently, its estimation is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimation of gross ibnr (refer to "critical accounting estimates - unpaid losses and loss expenses"). the second judgment involves our estimate of the amount of the reinsurance recoverable balance that we may ultimately be unable to recover from reinsurers due to insolvency, contractual dispute, or for other reasons. estimated uncollectible amounts are reflected in a provision that reduces the reinsurance recoverable asset and, in turn, shareholders' equity. changes in the provision for uncollectible reinsurance are reflected in net income.
although the obligation of individual reinsurers to pay their reinsurance obligations is based on specific contract provisions, the collectability of such amounts requires estimation by management. the majority of the recoverable balance will not be due for collection until sometime in the future, and the duration of our recoverables may be longer than the duration of our direct exposures. over this period of time, economic conditions and operational performance of a particular reinsurer may impact their ability to meet these obligations and while they may continue to acknowledge their contractual obligation to do so, they may not have the financial resources or willingness to fully meet their obligation to us.
to estimate the provision for uncollectible reinsurance, the reinsurance recoverable must first be determined for each reinsurer. this determination is based on a process rather than an estimate, although an element of judgment must be applied. as part of the process, ceded ibnr is allocated to reinsurance contracts because ceded ibnr is not generally calculated on a contract by contract basis. the allocations are generally based on premiums ceded under reinsurance contracts, adjusted for actual loss experience and historical relationships between gross and ceded losses. if actual premium and loss experience vary materially from historical experience, the allocation of reinsurance recoverable by reinsurer will be reviewed and may change. while such change is unlikely to result in a large percentage change in the provision for uncollectible reinsurance, it could, nevertheless, have a material effect on our net income in the period recorded.
generally, we use a default analysis to estimate uncollectible reinsurance. the primary components of the default analysis are reinsurance recoverable balances by reinsurer, net of collateral, and default factors used to estimate the probability that the reinsurer may be unable to meet its future obligations in full. the definition of collateral for this purpose requires some judgment and is generally limited to assets held in a chubb-only beneficiary trust, letters of credit, and liabilities held by us with the same legal entity for which we believe there is a right of offset. we do not currently include multi-beneficiary trusts. however, we have several reinsurers that have established multi-beneficiary trusts for which certain of our companies are beneficiaries. the determination of the default factor is principally based on the financial strength rating of the reinsurer and a corresponding default factor applicable to the financial strength rating. default factors require considerable judgment and are determined using the current financial strength rating, or rating equivalent, of each reinsurer as well as other key considerations and assumptions. significant considerations and assumptions include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:
•   for reinsurers that maintain a financial strength rating from a major rating agency, and for which recoverable balances are considered representative of the larger population (i.e., default probabilities are consistent with similarly rated reinsurers and payment durations conform to averages), the judgment exercised by management to determine the provision for uncollectible reinsurance of each reinsurer is typically limited because the financial rating is based on a published source and the default factor we apply is based on a historical default factor of a major rating agency applicable to the particular rating class. default factors applied for financial ratings of aaa, aa, a, bbb, bb, b, and ccc, are 0.8 percent, 1.2 percent, 1.7 percent, 4.9 percent, 19.6 percent, 34.0 percent, and 62.2 percent, respectively. because our model is predicated on the historical default factors of a major rating agency, we do not generally consider alternative factors. however, when a recoverable is expected to be paid in a brief period of time by a highly-rated reinsurer, such as certain property catastrophe claims, a default factor may not be applied;
•   for balances recoverable from reinsurers that are both unrated by a major rating agency and for which management is unable to determine a credible rating equivalent based on a parent or affiliated company, we may determine a rating equivalent based on our analysis of the reinsurer that considers an assessment of the creditworthiness of the particular entity, industry benchmarks, or other factors as considered appropriate. we then apply the applicable default factor for that rating class. for balances recoverable from unrated reinsurers for which our ceded reserve is below a certain threshold, we generally apply a default factor of 34.0 percent;
•   for balances recoverable from reinsurers that are either insolvent or under regulatory supervision, we establish a default factor and resulting provision for uncollectible reinsurance based on specific facts and circumstances surrounding each company. upon initial notification of an insolvency, we generally recognize expense for a substantial portion of all balances outstanding, net of collateral, through a combination of write-offs of recoverable balances and increases to the provision for uncollectible reinsurance. when regulatory action is taken on a reinsurer, we generally recognize a default factor by estimating an expected recovery on all balances outstanding, net of collateral. when sufficient credible information becomes available, we adjust the provision for uncollectible reinsurance by establishing a default factor pursuant to information received; and type reinsurers with credit ratings                                                                                     $8,399                                                                                  $7,601         $169
at december 31, 2015, the use of different assumptions within our approach could have a material effect on the provision for uncollectible reinsurance. to the extent the creditworthiness of our reinsurers were to deteriorate due to an adverse event affecting the reinsurance industry, such as a large number of major catastrophes, actual uncollectible amounts could be significantly greater than our provision for uncollectible reinsurance. such an event could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and our liquidity. given the various considerations used to estimate our uncollectible provision, we cannot precisely quantify the effect a specific industry event may have on the provision for uncollectible reinsurance. however, based on the composition (particularly the average credit quality) of the reinsurance recoverable balance at december 31, 2015, we estimate that a ratings downgrade of one notch for all rated reinsurers (i.e., from a to a- or a- to bbb+) could increase our provision for uncollectible reinsurance by approximately $69 million or approximately 0.6 percent of the gross reinsurance recoverable balance, assuming no other changes relevant to the calculation. while a ratings downgrade would result in an increase in our provision for uncollectible reinsurance and a charge to earnings in that period, a downgrade in and of itself does not imply that we will be unable to collect all of the ceded reinsurance recoverable from the reinsurers in question. refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
each quarter, we review securities in an unrealized loss position (impaired securities), including fixed maturities, securities lending collateral, equity securities, and other investments, to identify impaired securities to be specifically evaluated for a potential otti. because our investment portfolio is the largest component of consolidated assets and a multiple of shareholders' equity, otti could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. refer to note 3 d) to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the otti process.
deferred tax assets many of our insurance businesses operate in income tax-paying jurisdictions. our deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily result from temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities.  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities separately for each tax-paying component (an individual entity or group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes) in each tax jurisdiction. the realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax jurisdiction.
at december 31, 2015, our net deferred tax asset was $318 million. refer to note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. at each balance sheet date, management assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all, or some portion, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  the valuation allowance is based on all available information including projections of future taxable income from each tax-paying component in each tax jurisdiction, principally derived from business plans and available tax planning strategies.  projections of future taxable income incorporate several assumptions of future business and operations that are apt to differ from actual experience. the valuation allowance is also based on maintaining our ability and intent to hold our u.s. available for sale fixed maturities to recovery. if our assumptions and estimates that resulted in our forecast of future taxable income for each tax-paying component prove to be incorrect, or future market events occur that prevent our ability to hold our u.s. fixed maturities to recovery, an additional valuation allowance could become necessary, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.  at december 31, 2015, the valuation allowance of $38 million reflects management's assessment that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized due to the inability of certain foreign subsidiaries to generate sufficient taxable income.
assumed reinsurance programs involving minimum benefit guarantees under variable annuity contracts chubb reinsures various death and living benefit guarantees associated with variable annuities issued primarily in the united states and japan. we ceased writing this business in 2007. guarantees which are payable on death are referred to as guaranteed minimum death benefits (gmdb). guarantees on living benefits (glb) includes guaranteed minimum income benefits (gmib) and guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (gmab). for further description of this product and related accounting treatment, refer to note 1 j) to the consolidated financial statements.
guaranteed living benefits (glb) derivatives our glb reinsurance is classified as a derivative for accounting purposes and therefore carried at fair value. we believe that the most meaningful presentation of these glb derivatives is as follows:
•   estimates of the average modeled value of future cash outflows is recorded as incurred losses (i.e., benefit reserves). cash inflows or revenue are reported as net premiums earned and changes in the benefit reserves are reflected as policy benefits expense in the consolidated statements of operations, which is included in underwriting income.
•   the incremental difference between the fair value of glb reinsurance contracts and benefit reserves is reflected in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and related changes in fair value are reflected in net realized gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of operations.
determination of glb fair value the fair value of glb reinsurance is estimated using an internal valuation model, which includes current market information and estimates of policyholder behavior from the perspective of a theoretical market participant that would assume these liabilities. all of our treaties contain claim limits, which are factored into the valuation model. the fair value depends on a number of factors, including interest rates, equity markets, credit risk, current account value, market volatility, expected annuitization rates and other policyholder behavior, and changes in policyholder mortality. the model and related assumptions are regularly re-evaluated by management and enhanced, as appropriate, based upon additional experience obtained related to policyholder behavior and availability of more timely market information. due to the inherent uncertainties of the assumptions used in the valuation models to determine the fair value of these derivative products, actual experience may differ materially from the estimates reflected in our consolidated financial statements.
we intend to hold these derivative contracts to maturity (i.e., the expiration of the underlying liabilities through lapse, annuitization, death, or expiration of the reinsurance contract). to partially offset the risk of changes in the fair value of glb reinsurance contracts, we invest in derivative hedge instruments. at maturity, the cumulative realized gains and losses (excluding cumulative hedge gains or losses) from fair value changes of glb reinsurance contracts will net to zero because, over time, the insurance liability will be increased or decreased to equal our obligation.
determination of glb and guaranteed minimum death benefits (gmdb) benefit reserves management established benefit reserves based on a long-term benefit ratio (or loss ratio) calculated using assumptions reflecting management's best estimate of the future short-term and long-term performance of the variable annuity line of business. despite the long-term nature of the risk, the benefit ratio calculation is impacted by short-term market movements that may be judged by management to be transient. management regularly examines both qualitative and quantitative analysis, including a review of the differential between the benefit ratio used at the most recent valuation date and the benefit ratio calculated on subsequent dates. management regularly evaluates its estimates and uses judgment to determine the extent to which assumptions underlying the benefit ratio calculation should be adjusted. for the year ended december 31, 2015, management determined that no change to the benefit ratio was warranted.
for further information on the estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair value of glb reinsurance, refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. for a sensitivity discussion of the effect of changes in interest rates, equity indices, and other assumptions on the fair value of glbs, and the resulting impact on our net income, refer to item 7a.
risk management we employ a strategy to manage the financial market and policyholder behavior risks embedded in the reinsurance of variable annuity (va) guarantees. risk management begins with underwriting a prospective client and guarantee design, with particular focus on protecting our position from policyholder options that, because of anti-selective behavior, could adversely impact our obligation.
a second layer of risk management is the structure of the reinsurance contracts. all va guarantee reinsurance contracts include some form of annual or aggregate claim limit(s). for example, for 60 percent of the gmdb portfolio (based on guaranteed value), there is an annual claim limit of 2 percent of account value. the different categories of claim limits are as follows:
reinsurance program covering                                                                                                 % of total guaranteed value (gv)   % of gv that has additional reinsurance coverage   additional terms gmdb with an annual claim limit of 2% of account value (av)                                                                                 60% of total gmdb                                         2% for glb   n/a gmdb with claim limit(s) that are a function of underlying gv (varies from 0.4% to 2.0% of gv)                                              30% of total gmdb                                        80% for glb   • 60% of gv subject to annual claim deductibles(1) of 0.1% to 0.2% of gv• 40% of gv subject to an aggregate claim limit of approximately $385 million gmdb and gmab                                                                                                                                10% of total glb                                                n/a   • programs are quota-share (qs) agreements with qs % decreasing as ratio of av to gv decreases: - qs 100% for ratios between 100% - 75% - qs 60% for ratios between 75% - 45% - qs 30% for ratios less than 45%• 35% of gv subject to a per policy claim deductible of 8.8% of gv for gmab only(1)

we also limit the aggregate amount of variable annuity reinsurance guarantee risk we are willing to assume. the last substantive transactions were quoted in late 2007. the aggregate number of policyholders is currently decreasing through policyholder withdrawals, annuitizations, and deaths at a rate of 5 percent to 15 percent per annum.
note that glb claims cannot occur for any reinsured policy until it has reached the end of its "waiting period." as shown in the table below, 55 percent of the policies we reinsure reached the end of their "waiting periods" in 2015 and prior.
year of first payment eligibility   percent of living benefitaccount values the following table presents the historical cash flows under these policies for the periods indicated. the amounts represent accrued past premium received and claims paid, split by benefit type.
collateral chubb holds collateral on behalf of most of its clients in the form of qualified assets in trust or letters of credit, typically in an amount sufficient for the client to obtain statutory reserve credit for the reinsurance.  the timing of the calculation and amount of the collateral varies by client according to the particulars of the reinsurance treaty and the statutory reserve guidelines of the client's domicile.
goodwill impairment goodwill, which represents the excess of acquisition cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired, was $4.8 billion and $4.9 billion at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. during 2015, our goodwill balance decreased 2 percent, primarily due to the negative impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by an acquisition. goodwill is not amortized but is subject to a periodic evaluation for impairment at least annually, or earlier if there are any indications of possible impairment. impairment is tested at the reporting unit level. goodwill is assigned to applicable reporting units of acquired entities at acquisition. the most significant reporting units are:
•   domestic and international divisions of ace ina acquired in 1999, including subsequent domestic and international acquisitions; and the impairment evaluation first uses a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e., more than a 50 percent probability) that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount. if a reporting unit fails this qualitative assessment, a quantitative analysis is then used. the quantitative analysis is a two-step process in which an initial assessment for potential impairment is performed and, if a potential impairment is present, the amount of impairment is measured and recorded.
other reporting units from smaller acquisitions are also assessed annually. based on our impairment testing for 2015, we determined no impairment was required and none of our reporting units were at risk for impairment.
in assessing the fair value of a reporting unit, we make assumptions and estimates about the profitability attributable to our reporting units, including:
•   estimated cost of equity and changes in long-term risk-free interest rates.
if our assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of acquired entities change, we could be required to write-down the carrying value of goodwill which could be material to our results of operations in the period the charge is taken.

(1)   in 2015 and 2014 net premiums written increased $860 million or 5.1%, and $952 million or 5.7%, respectively, in constant dollars. amounts are calculated by translating prior period results using the same local currency rates as the current period.
(3)   other (income) expense includes (gains) losses from fair value changes in separate account assets that do not qualify for separate account reporting under gaap. in 2015, 2014, and 2013 these (gains) losses were $19 million, $(2) million, and $(16) million, respectively. the offsetting movement in the separate account liabilities is included in policy benefits.
the following tables present a breakdown of consolidated net premiums written:
net premiums written reflect the premiums we retain after purchasing reinsurance protection. consolidated net premiums written decreased less than one percent in 2015. on a constant-dollar basis, net premiums written increased 5.1 percent ($860 million).
•   net premiums written in our insurance - north american p&amp;c segment increased $677 million in constant dollars reflecting solid renewal retention and new business in our risk management, a&amp;h, surety, retail and wholesale casualty, commercial risk services (crs), and personal lines divisions. these increases were partially offset by declines in our retail and wholesale property divisions, as well as in our retail casualty business, reflecting a more competitive market and rate decreases, and lower excess of loss premiums for the 2014 property catastrophe program of $32 million. net premiums written also increased due to the acquisition of fireman's fund high net worth personal lines business in april 2015 which added $561 million of growth. included in premiums from fireman's fund is $252 million of non-recurring unearned premium reserves recognized as written premiums at the date of purchase. excluding the fireman's fund acquisition, net premiums written increased 1.3 percent, or 1.9 percent in constant dollars.
•   net premiums written in our insurance - overseas general segment increased $441 million in constant dollars reflecting organic growth across most operations. growth in our retail operations in personal and p&amp;c product lines was from new business writings. included in the increase in net premiums written were contributions from the acquisition of itaú seguros in october 2014 and samaggi in april 2014 which added $273 million of growth to premiums in constant dollars.
•   net premiums written in our life segment increased $71 million in constant dollars due to new business growth in our supplemental a&amp;h businesses and our international life business, primarily in asia, tempered by a decline in our variable annuity reinsurance business, as there is currently no new business being written.
•   net premiums written in our global reinsurance segment decreased $85 million in constant dollars primarily due to lower production from competitive market conditions. the decline was partially offset by new business written, primarily in our u.s. automobile business.
•   net premiums written in our insurance - north american agriculture segment decreased $244 million in 2015 due to lower commodity base prices and lower premium retention as a result of the premium-sharing formulas with the u.s. government.
consolidated net premiums written increased 4.6 percent in 2014. in constant dollars, net premiums written increased 5.7 percent ($952 million).
•   net premiums written in our insurance - north american p&amp;c segment increased $368 million in constant dollars from growth across a broad range of our product portfolio throughout our ace usa retail and our wholesale divisions, as well as in our commercial risk services and ace private risk services divisions, primarily reflecting strong renewal retention and new business.
•   net premiums written in our insurance - overseas general segment increased $600 million in constant dollars reflecting new business writings in our retail operations in all product lines - personal lines, a&amp;h, and p&amp;c and growth of $310 million from the acquisitions of fianzas monterrey in april 2013, aba seguros in may 2013, samaggi in april 2014, and itaú seguros in october 2014.
•   net premiums written in our life segment increased $78 million in constant dollars due to new business growth in our asian markets.
•   net premiums written in our global reinsurance segment decreased $57 million in constant dollars due to the non-renewal of a large workers' compensation treaty, partially offset by new business written.
•   net premiums written in our insurance - north american agriculture segment decreased $37 million primarily due to lower multiple peril crop insurance (mpci) revenues reflecting lower commodity prices, partially offset by higher premium retention as a result of the non-renewal of a third-party proportional reinsurance agreement.
net premiums earned for short-duration contracts, typically p&c contracts, generally reflect the portion of net premiums written that were recorded as revenues for the period as the exposure periods expire. net premiums earned for long-duration contracts, typically traditional life contracts, generally are recognized as earned when due from policyholders. net premiums earned decreased 1.2 percent in 2015 primarily reflecting the adverse impact of foreign exchange. on a constant-dollar basis, net premiums earned increased 4.3 percent due to the same factors driving the increase in net premiums written as described above. net premiums earned increased 4.9 percent in 2014, or 6.0 percent in constant dollars, primarily in our insurance - overseas general, insurance - north american p&c, and life segments as described above. our global reinsurance segment also reported an increase in net premiums earned primarily from the shorter earning period on certain of the new business written including two non-recurring short-term treaties. net premiums earned decreased in our insurance - north american agriculture segment from lower net premiums written as described above.
in evaluating our segments excluding life, we use the combined ratio, the loss and loss expense ratio, the policy acquisition cost ratio, and the administrative expense ratio. we calculate these ratios by dividing the respective expense amounts by net premiums earned. we do not calculate these ratios for the life segment as we do not use these measures to monitor or manage that segment. the combined ratio is determined by adding the loss and loss expense ratio, the policy acquisition cost ratio, and the administrative expense ratio. a combined ratio under 100 percent indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio exceeding 100 percent indicates underwriting loss.
the following table presents the components of gaap combined ratio as well as a reconciliation of gaap combined ratio to p&c combined ratio. the p&c combined ratio is a non-gaap financial measure and includes the impact of gains and losses on crop derivatives. these derivatives were purchased to provide economic benefit, in a manner similar to reinsurance protection, in the event that a significant decline in commodity pricing impacts underwriting results. we view gains and losses on these derivatives as part of the results of our underwriting operations.
policy acquisition cost ratio        16.1   %        16.8    %      15.7   %
total net pre-tax catastrophe losses, excluding reinstatement premiums, were $321 million in 2015, compared with $291 million in 2014 and $230 million in 2013. catastrophe losses in 2015 were primarily related to severe weather-related events in the u.s. and asia, a chemical storage facility explosion in tianjin, china, a hailstorm in australia, and flooding and an earthquake in chile. catastrophe losses in 2014 were primarily related to severe weather-related events in the u.s., japan, and australia; flooding and hailstorms in europe; and a hurricane in mexico. catastrophe losses in 2013 were primarily from flooding in canada and australia and severe weather-related events in the u.s. the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio remained relatively flat in 2015. in 2014, the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio decreased due to underwriting actions improving loss ratios on several portfolios and higher losses in 2013 in our mpci program.
prior period development arises from changes to loss estimates recognized in the current year that relate to loss events that occurred in previous calendar years and excludes the effect of losses from the development of earned premium from previous accident years. we experienced net favorable prior period development of $546 million in 2015, $527 million in 2014, and $530 million in 2013, which includes an asbestos and environmental (a&e) and other run-off charge of $170 million, $215 million, and $166 million, respectively. refer to "prior period development" for additional information.
policy acquisition costs consist of commissions, premium taxes, and certain underwriting costs related directly to the successful acquisition of a new or renewal insurance contract. administrative expenses include all other operating costs. our policy acquisition ratio decreased in 2015 due to the impact of normal initial purchase accounting adjustments related to our acquisition of fireman's fund in our insurance - north american p&c segment. the non-recurring unearned premium reserves (upr) transfer, discussed in our insurance - north american p&c segment, benefited the policy acquisition cost ratio by 0.7 percentage points. our policy acquisition cost ratio increased in 2014 primarily due to the normal impact of initial year purchase accounting adjustments related to our mexican acquisitions which favorably impacted the 2013 ratio. as a result of purchase accounting requirements, the unearned premiums at the date of purchase related to the businesses acquired are recognized over the remaining coverage period with no expense for the associated historical acquisition costs that were incurred to underwrite those policies.
our administrative expense ratio increased in 2015 primarily due to increased spending to support growth and the integration costs associated with the fireman's fund acquisition. our administrative expense ratio decreased slightly in 2014 as growth in net premiums earned outpaced growth in administrative expenses, partially offset by the favorable impact of a $29 million prior year legal settlement.
chubb integration expenses were $33 million for 2015 and include legal and professional fees and all other external costs directly related to the integration activities of the chubb acquisition.
our effective income tax rate, which we calculate as income tax expense divided by income before income tax, is dependent upon the mix of earnings from different jurisdictions with various tax rates. a change in the geographic mix of earnings would change the effective income tax rate. our effective income tax rate was 14.0 percent in 2015, compared with 18.2 percent and 11.3 percent in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the effective income tax rate in 2015 is lower compared to 2014 primarily due to a $115 million change to deferred tax assets in 2014 that resulted from the decline in the book value of certain foreign subsidiaries, related to unrealized foreign exchange losses. the effective income tax rate in 2014 is higher compared to 2013 primarily due to both net realized losses and a lower percentage of operating earnings being generated in lower tax paying jurisdictions as well as the change to deferred tax assets noted above. the lower tax rates attributed to our foreign operations primarily reflects lower corporate tax rates that prevail outside of the u.s. during 2015, approximately 69 percent of our total pre-tax income was tax effected based on these lower rates compared with 66 percent and 73 percent in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the significant jurisdictions outside of the u.s. include the u.k., switzerland, and bermuda with effective federal income tax rates in those countries of 20.25 percent, 7.83 percent, and 0.0 percent, respectively.
prior period development the following table summarizes (favorable) and adverse prior period development (ppd) by segments. long-tail lines include lines such as workers' compensation, general liability, and professional liability; while short-tail lines include lines such as most property lines, energy, personal accident, aviation, marine (including associated liability-related exposures) and agriculture.
we operate through five business segments: insurance - north american p&c, insurance - north american agriculture, insurance - overseas general, global reinsurance, and life. for additional information refer to "segment information" under item 1. the discussions that follow include tables that show our segment operating results for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013.

net premiums written increased in 2015 due to growth in our risk management, a&h, surety, and professional lines of business in our retail division reflecting solid renewal retention and new business. there was also growth in our wholesale casualty and professional lines businesses. our small specialty division (commercial risk services, or crs) grew due to higher new business reflecting increased submission activity and the introduction of new products, as well as strong premium renewal retention. our personal lines division, specifically products offered through ace private risk services, also generated higher premiums primarily due to the fireman's fund acquisition. net premiums were favorably impacted by lower excess of loss premiums ceded under our 2014 catastrophe reinsurance program of $32 million. these increases were partially offset by declines in our retail and wholesale property divisions and in our retail casualty business reflecting a more competitive market and rate decreases. the acquisition of fireman's fund high net worth personal lines business in april 2015 added $561 million of growth to premiums. excluding the fireman's fund acquisition, net premiums written increased 1.3 percent. foreign exchange adversely impacted growth by $34 million (0.6 percentage points). net premiums written in 2015 included $252 million of non-recurring unearned premium reserves (upr) recognized as written premiums at the date of the fireman's fund acquisition. underwriting income for the year included a benefit of $100 million related to the initial upr transfer as unearned premiums at the date of the transfer are recognized over the remaining coverage period with no associated expense for the historical acquisition costs. these costs are eliminated in purchase accounting. this underwriting benefit was partially offset by the amortization of the intangible asset related to this upr of $71 million for a pre-tax net income impact of $30 million ($22 million after-tax).
net premiums written increased in 2014 in our ace usa retail division from growth across a broad range of our product portfolio, including our risk management, general and specialty casualty, a&h, professional risk, and surety lines of business reflecting strong renewal retention and new business. this growth was partially offset by reductions in our retail property division reflecting a more competitive market and rate decreases. net premiums written grew in our wholesale division from higher production in our casualty, property, and professional lines of business, and in our commercial risk services division, primarily due to growth in our specialty and program business. our personal lines division contributed to the increase in net premiums written due to higher production in the homeowners, automobile and umbrella business offered through ace private risk services. net premiums written in 2014 were favorably impacted by lower excess of loss premiums ceded under our 2014 catastrophe reinsurance program of $32 million.
net premiums earned increased in 2015 and 2014 primarily due to the increase in net premiums written as described above.
net pre-tax catastrophe losses, excluding reinstatement premiums, were $148 million in 2015, compared with $132 million in 2014 and $94 million in 2013. catastrophe losses in 2015 were primarily from severe-weather related events in the u.s., including the california wildfires, mexican hurricane, and civil unrest in baltimore, maryland. catastrophe losses in 2014 were primarily from severe weather-related events in the u.s., bermuda and australia, as well as a hurricane in mexico. catastrophe losses in 2013 were primarily from flooding in canada and severe weather-related events in the u.s. net favorable prior period development was $39 million in 2015, compared with $107 million in 2014 and $134 million in 2013. refer to the "prior period development" section for additional information. the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio decreased 0.6 percentage points in 2015 reflecting the favorable impact of the acquisition of fireman's fund personal lines business which carries a lower loss ratio. excluding the impact of the acquisition, the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio increased 0.3 percentage points due to lower excess of loss premiums ceded in the prior year from the 2014 catastrophe reinsurance program. the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio decreased 0.2 percentage points in 2014 due to lower loss ratios in several of our lines where a combination of the execution of detailed portfolio management plans, product mix and earned rate changes resulted in improved current accident year loss ratio performance. the improvement was partially offset by higher non-catastrophe large losses during the year.
the policy acquisition cost ratio decreased 1.3 percentage points in 2015 primarily due to the impact of normal initial year purchase accounting adjustments related to our fireman's fund acquisition. as a result of purchase accounting requirements, the unearned premiums at the date of the purchase related to the business acquired are recognized over the remaining coverage period with no expense for the associated historical acquisition costs that were incurred to write those policies, thereby favorably impacting the policy acquisition ratio by 1.4 percentage points. excluding the fireman's fund acquisition, the policy acquisition cost ratio increased slightly due to a change in the mix of business. the policy acquisition cost ratio remained flat in 2014 compared to 2013.
the administrative expense ratio increased 0.3 percentage points in 2015 due to the integration costs associated with the fireman's fund acquisition as well as increased spending to support growth. the administrative expense ratio was higher in 2014 compared to the prior year ratio which included a 0.5 point favorable impact related to a $29 million legal settlement. excluding the impact of the legal settlement, the administrative expense ratio remained relatively flat compared with the prior year.
insurance - north american agriculture the insurance - north american agriculture segment comprises our north american based businesses that provide a variety of coverages in the u.s. and canada including crop insurance, primarily mpci and crop-hail through rain and hail as well as farm and ranch and specialty p&c commercial insurance products and services through our ace agribusiness unit.

(1)   gains (losses) on crop derivatives were $(9) million and $51 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. these gains (losses) are reclassified from net realized gains (losses) to losses and loss expenses for purposes of presenting insurance - north american agriculture underwriting income. refer to note 10 and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these derivatives.
net premiums written decreased in 2015 primarily due to lower commodity base prices used to price the 2015 mpci policies and lower premium retention as a result of the premium-sharing formulas with the u.s. government. under the government's crop insurance profit and loss calculation formulas, we retained more premiums in 2014 as losses were higher compared to 2015.
net premiums written decreased in 2014 principally due to lower commodity base prices and lower premium retention for the mpci business as a result of the premium-sharing formulas with the u.s. government in 2014 for the mpci business. under the government's crop insurance profit and loss calculation formula, we retained more premiums in 2013 as losses were higher. the decrease in net premiums written was partially offset by higher premium retention as a result of the non-renewal of a third-party proportional reinsurance agreement.
net pre-tax catastrophe losses, excluding reinstatement premiums, were $9 million in 2015, compared with $13 million in 2014 and $7 million in 2013. net prior period development was $45 million favorable in 2015, compared with $34 million unfavorable in 2014 and $13 million favorable in 2013. for 2015 the prior period development amount included a decrease in incurred losses of $42 million for lower than expected mpci losses for the 2014 crop year, partially offset by a $6 million decrease in net premiums earned related to the government's crop insurance profit and loss calculation formula. for 2014, the prior period development amount includes an increase in incurred losses of $64 million for higher than expected mpci losses for the 2013 crop year, as well as $26 million of favorable increase in net premiums earned related to the government's crop insurance profit and loss calculation formula. refer to the "prior period development" section for additional information. the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio increased 1.0 percentage point in 2015 principally due to relatively flat unallocated loss adjustment expenses with lower earned premiums. the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio declined 9.5 percentage points in 2014 due to lower commodity prices in the prior year that resulted in higher losses in our mpci program in 2013. the lower ratio in 2014 also reflected the benefit of our crop derivatives entered into in 2014.
the policy acquisition cost ratio decreased 0.2 percentage points in 2015 primarily due to higher cede commission on third-party reinsurance and lower agent profit sharing commission. the policy acquisition cost ratio increased 2.1 percentage points in 2014, primarily due to less net premiums earned in our mpci business as a result of lower commodity prices, a reduction in ceded commission benefits on third-party reinsurance primarily due to the non-renewal of a third-party proportional reinsurance agreement, and lower agent commission accruals in 2013.
the administrative expense ratio decreased 0.6 percentage points in 2015 primarily due to higher a&o reimbursements on the mpci business. the administrative expense ratio remained flat in 2014 compared with 2013.

(1)  for the year ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, net premiums written increased $441 million or 7.1% and $601 million or 9.4% in constant dollars, respectively. amounts are calculated by translating prior period results using the same local currency rates as the comparable current period.
(2) for the year ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, underwriting income decreased $22 million or (2.5)% and increased $166 million or 20.7%, in constant dollars, respectively. amounts are calculated by translating prior period results using the same local currency rates as the comparable current period.
net premiums written decreased 5.2 percent in 2015 primarily reflecting the adverse impact of foreign exchange which reduced growth by $807 million or 11.5 percent. on a constant-dollar basis, net premiums written increased 7.1 percent in 2015, reflecting organic growth across most operations. growth in our retail operations for personal and p&c product lines was from new business writings. included in the increase in net premiums written were contributions from the acquisitions of itaú seguros in october 2014 and samaggi in april 2014 which added $273 million of premiums.
net premiums written increased 7.4 percent in 2014, or 9.4 percent in constant dollars, from new business writings in our retail operations in all product lines - personal lines, a&h, and p&c. the increase in personal lines reflected growth in all regions, and a&h growth was driven by strong results in all regions except europe. p&c growth was driven primarily by new business writings in asia and latin america. in addition, the acquisitions of fianzas monterrey in april 2013, aba seguros in may 2013, samaggi, and itaú seguros added $310 million of growth to premiums. foreign exchange adversely impacted growth by $122 million on a constant-dollar basis.
net premiums earned decreased in 2015 primarily reflecting the adverse impact of foreign exchange. net premiums earned increased in 2015 and 2014 in constant dollars, due to the same factors driving the increase in net premiums written as described above.
net pre-tax catastrophe losses, excluding reinstatement premiums, were $142 million in 2015, compared with $112 million in 2014 and $88 million in 2013. catastrophe losses in 2015 were primarily related to a chemical storage facility explosion in tianjin, china, a hailstorm in australia, flooding and an earthquake in chile, and severe storms in the u.k. and asia. catastrophe losses in 2014 were primarily related to flooding in europe, severe storms in japan, a hurricane in mexico, and a hailstorm in australia. catastrophe losses in 2013 were primarily related to flooding in australia, europe, and canada, as well as hurricanes in latin america, and an earthquake in new zealand. net favorable prior period development was $343 million in 2015, compared with $391 million in 2014 and $299 million in 2013. refer to the "prior period development" section for additional information. the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio improved by 0.7 percentage points in 2015 due to lower non-catastrophe large losses. the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio decreased 0.7 percentage points in 2014 due primarily to both mix of business and underwriting actions which improved loss ratios on several portfolios.
the policy acquisition ratio increased 0.5 percentage points in 2015, primarily due to lower ceded commission benefits as a result of the non-renewal of an a&h external quota share treaty, (0.3 percentage points), as well as less favorable normal initial year purchase accounting adjustments than in 2014 (0.3 percentage points). as a result of purchase accounting requirements, the unearned premiums at the date of purchase related to the businesses acquired are recognized over the remaining coverage period with no expense for the associated historical acquisition costs that were incurred to underwrite those policies. the policy acquisition ratio increased 1.0 percentage point in 2014 due primarily to less favorable normal initial year purchase accounting adjustments than in 2013 (0.6 percentage points). in addition, the policy acquisition cost ratio increased due to a change in the overall mix of business towards a&h and personal lines products in regions that have higher acquisition cost ratios.
the administrative expense ratio increased 0.4 percentage points in 2015 primarily due to a higher proportion of expenses incurred in u.s. dollars compared to premiums earned in foreign currencies as well as integration expenses related to our itaú seguros acquisition. the administrative expense ratio decreased 0.9 percentage points in 2014 due primarily to growth in net premiums earned that outpaced the growth in administrative expenses. in addition, the administrative expense ratio decreased due to increased spending in 2013 to support growth.

net premiums written decreased in 2015 as we maintained underwriting discipline in an environment of flat to declining rates and increasing competition. the decline was partially offset by new business written, primarily in our u.s. automobile business. net premiums written decreased in 2014 primarily due to the non-renewal of a $79 million workers' compensation treaty, partially offset by new business written.
net premiums earned decreased in 2015 primarily due to the same factors driving the decrease in net premiums written as described above and from the adverse impact of the non-renewal of a workers' compensation treaty in the third quarter of 2014, which resulted in a $39 million decrease in premiums. net premiums earned increased in 2014 primarily from the shorter earning period on certain of the new business written including two non-recurring short-term treaties.
net pre-tax catastrophe losses, excluding reinstatement premiums, were $22 million in 2015, compared with $34 million in 2014 and $41 million in 2013. catastrophe losses in 2015 were primarily related to severe weather-related events in the u.s. catastrophe losses in 2014 were related to severe storms in japan, european hailstorms, and severe weather-related events in the u.s. catastrophe losses in 2013 were primarily from flooding in canada and europe. net favorable prior period development was $119 million in 2015, compared with $63 million in 2014 and $84 million in 2013 (2015, 2014 and 2013 are net of $4 million, $10 million, and $8 million, respectively, of unfavorable premium adjustments to loss sensitive treaties). refer to the "prior period development" section for additional information. the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio increased 0.4 percentage points in 2015 primarily due to a change in the mix of business in the current year towards higher loss ratio products in the u.s., offset by the non-renewal of a workers' compensation treaty in 2014, which had a higher loss ratio. the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio decreased slightly in 2014 compared to 2013.
the policy acquisition cost ratio increased 0.2 percentage points in 2015 due to the non-renewal of the workers' compensation treaty in 2014, noted above, which incurred no acquisition costs. the policy acquisition cost ratio increased in 2014 primarily due to a change in the mix of business towards products written in the u.s. that have a higher acquisition cost ratio than in other regions and the impact of the non-renewal of the workers' compensation treaty noted above, which incurred no acquisition costs.
life the life segment includes our international life operations (ace life), ace tempest life re (ace life re), and the north american supplemental a&h and life business of combined insurance (a&h). we assess the performance of our life business based on life underwriting income, which includes net investment income and (gains) losses from fair value changes in separate account assets that do not qualify for separate account reporting under gaap.

the following table presents a line of business breakdown of life net premiums written and deposits collected on universal life and investment contracts:
net premiums written (excludes deposits below)                     $1,998          $2,012          $1,972              $1,927              $1,934                (0.7   )%                  2.0    %                      3.7    %                       4.0    %

(1) includes the north american supplemental a&h and life business of combined insurance life net premiums written decreased slightly in 2015 reflecting the adverse impact of foreign exchange of $84 million. life net premiums written increased 3.7 percent in 2015 in constant dollars, reflecting growth in our a&h and life insurance businesses. a&h net premiums written increased due to growth in our core distribution channels, primarily combined insurance's supplemental a&h individual and group sales. our life insurance business grew primarily in asia. our life reinsurance business continues to decline as there is no new life reinsurance business currently being written. life net premiums written increased 2.0 percent, or 4.0 percent in constant dollars in 2014. a&h net premiums written remained flat in 2014 after adjusting for the $16 million unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. life insurance net premiums written increased in
2014 primarily due to growth in our asian markets. our life reinsurance business continues to decline as there is no new life reinsurance business currently being written.
in 2014, we determined that certain a&h marketing-related costs were more appropriately classified as acquisition costs. this resulted in a $59 million increase to acquisition expenses and an offsetting decrease to administrative expenses in 2014.
life underwriting income decreased in 2015 primarily due to unfavorable loss reserve development related to our a&h business in the current year, compared to favorable reserve development last year. the prior year was also favorable impacted by a one-time adjustment to certain life products in asia. foreign exchange adversely impacted underwriting income on an as reported basis. life underwriting income decreased slightly in 2014 compared to 2013.
deposits collected on universal life and investment contracts (life deposits) are not reflected as revenues in our consolidated statements of operations in accordance with gaap. new life deposits are an important component of production, and although they do not significantly affect current period income from operations they are key to our efforts to grow our business. the increase in life deposits collected in both 2015 and 2014 is primarily due to growth in our asian markets.
net realized gains (losses), which are excluded from life underwriting income, relate primarily to the change in the net fair value of reported guaranteed living benefits (glb) reinsurance liabilities and changes in the fair value of derivatives used to partially offset the risk in the variable annuity guarantee portfolio. during 2015, realized losses of $203 million were associated with a net increase in the fair value of the glb liabilities. these increases were primarily due to the falling equity market levels and the unfavorable impact of discounting future claims for one less year, partially offset by higher interest rates.
in the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed a review of policyholder behavior related to partial withdrawals and updated our review of policyholder lapse and annuitization behavior by treaty for our variable annuity reinsurance business.  reinsured policies allow for policyholders to make periodic withdrawals from their account values without lapsing the policy. the partial withdrawal results in a reduction to the associated guaranteed value that is either equal or proportional to the amount of the reduction in account value. based on our review of emerging behavior, we refined our assumptions around the types of partial withdrawals according to their impact on guaranteed value. this resulted in an increase to the fair value of glb liabilities generating a realized loss of approximately $110 million. as lapse experience continued to emerge, we were able to expand our analysis and further refine our assumptions which resulted in a net increase to the fair value of glb liabilities generating a realized loss of approximately $10 million. because of a greater degree of reported experience related to behavior in years subsequent to the first year of annuitization eligibility, we also made several changes to our annuitization assumptions, which generally lowered the annuitization rate for most clients, while raising it for one client. the change in annuitization assumptions decreased the fair value of glb liabilities and generated a realized gain of approximately $80 million. we will continue to monitor actual policyholder behavior (lapse, partial withdrawal, and annuitization) against our assumptions and make adjustments as appropriate in the period we receive and analyze this data. also, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we refined certain assumptions around policyholder annuity type selection based on claim experience. this refinement decreased the fair value of glb liabilities and generated a realized gain of approximately $45 million.
during 2014, realized losses of $213 million were associated with a net increase in the value of glb liabilities; this increase was primarily due to lower interest rates and the unfavorable impact of discounting future claims for one less year, partially offset by a weakening yen and rising u.s. equity levels.
during 2013, realized gains of $929 million were associated with a net decrease in the value of glb liabilities; this decrease was primarily due to rising equity levels, higher interest rates, and a weakening yen, partially offset by a net unfavorable impact of changes in lapse and annuitization assumptions and the unfavorable impact of discounting future claims for one less year.
we maintain positions in derivative instruments that increase in fair value when the s&p 500 index decreases. during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we experienced realized losses of $10 million, $168 million, and $579 million, respectively, related to these derivative instruments.
fixed maturities                   $2,157                $2,199                $2,093

net investment income is influenced by a number of factors including the amounts and timing of inward and outward cash flows, the level of interest rates, and changes in overall asset allocation. net investment income decreased 2.6 percent in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to the negative impact of foreign exchange of $49 million and lower call activity in our corporate bond portfolio, partially offset by a higher overall invested asset base. net investment income increased 5.1 percent in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to a higher overall invested asset base and call activity in our corporate bond portfolio, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange.
the yield on our fixed maturities was 4.0 percent for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 3.9 percent in 2013. this compares to the average market yield, which represents the weighted average yield to maturity of our fixed income portfolio based on market prices of the holdings at that date, of 2.8 percent in both december 31, 2015 and 2014 and 3.0 percent at december 31, 2013.
the 1.3 percent, 1.9 percent, and 1.3 percent yield on short-term investments for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, reflects the global nature of our insurance operations. for example, yields on short-term investments in brazil, mexico, indonesia, and malaysia range from 3.3 percent to 14.3 percent in 2015. the yield in 2015 is lower compared to 2014 despite a higher average balance in short-term investments, due to investments held in the u.s. in anticipation of the chubb acquisition, which earned a lower yield.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, the yield on our equity securities portfolio was 3.1 percent compared with 4.9 percent for 2014 and 4.6 percent for 2013, and reflects the yield on a global high dividend equity portfolio. the prior years also included dividends from an emerging debt portfolio, which was a mutual fund classified as equity. during the third quarter of 2014, however, we elected to exchange our interest in the strategic emerging debt portfolio for direct ownership of certain of the underlying fixed maturities, and the remainder in cash. in 2013 and 2014, the strategic emerging debt portfolio, prior to the election to exchange our interest, and the preferred equity securities represented 76 percent and 64 percent, respectively, of the gross equity securities investment income.
return on average invested assets is lower in 2015 compared to 2014 and 2013 primarily due to increased holdings in u.s. short-term investments in anticipation of the chubb acquisition, which earned a low yield.
we take a long-term view with our investment strategy, and our investment managers manage our investment portfolio to maximize total return within certain specific guidelines designed to minimize risk. the majority of our investment portfolio is available for sale and reported at fair value. our held to maturity investment portfolio is reported at amortized cost.
the effect of market movements on our available for sale investment portfolio impacts net income (through net realized gains (losses)) when securities are sold or when we record an other-than-temporary impairment (otti) charge in net income. for a discussion related to how we assess otti for all of our investments, including credit-related otti, and the related impact on net income, refer to note 3 e) to the consolidated financial statements. additionally, net income is impacted through the reporting of changes in the fair value of derivatives, including financial futures, options, swaps, and glb reinsurance. changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on available for sale securities, which result from the revaluation of securities held, are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheets.

(1)   for the year ended december 31, 2015, other-than-temporary impairments include $103 million for fixed maturities, $7 million for public equity, and $2 million for private equity. for the year ended december 31, 2014, other-than-temporary impairments include $57 million for fixed maturities, $3 million for private equity, and $8 million for public equity.
at december 31, 2015, our investment portfolios held by u.s. legal entities included approximately $97 million of gross unrealized losses on fixed income investments. our tax planning strategy related to these losses is based on our view that we will hold these fixed income investments until they recover their cost. as such, we have recognized a deferred tax asset of approximately $34 million related to these fixed income investments. this strategy allows us to recognize the associated deferred tax asset related to these fixed income investments as we do not believe these losses will ever be realized.
other income and expense items effective 2015, amortization of intangible assets are excluded from other (income) expense and disclosed separately in the consolidated statements of operations. prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
other (income) expense was $(51) million in 2015 compared with $(190) million and $(80) million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for the components of other (income) expense.
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets was $171 million in 2015 compared with $108 million and $95 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.  refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for the amortization of intangible assets as well as the expected amortization expense for the next five years.
the pre-tax amortization expense related to purchased intangibles resulting from the chubb acquisition, which will be included in amortization of intangible assets is currently expected to reduce amortization expense in 2016. this impact reflects the fact that the unfavorable amortization expense from these purchased intangible assets will be more than offset by the favorable impact of amortization of the loss reserve fair value adjustment. the intangibles that are subject to amortization, consist principally of distributor relationships and technology.
for 2016, the amortization of acquired upr intangible of the chubb acquisition (currently estimated at $1.5 billion) is expected to be recognized through policy acquisition costs (within segment underwriting income) in line with the earnings pattern of the acquired upr, with approximately 40 percent in the first quarter, 30 percent in the second quarter, 20 percent in the third quarter, and 10 percent in the fourth quarter.  this amortization will reduce the positive impact of the elimination of the historical deferred acquisition costs (approximately $1.3 billion) given that these costs are eliminated in purchase accounting.
in addition, net income in 2016 will also include the net impact of the amortization associated with the fair value adjustments of acquired invested assets and long-term debt related to purchase accounting.  these items will amortize through net investment income and interest expense, respectively, on the consolidated statement of operations.
we will provide updated information regarding the expected impact of the amortization of the intangibles related to the chubb acquisition in a future filing with the sec.
investments our investment portfolio is invested primarily in publicly traded, investment grade, fixed income securities with an average credit quality of a/aa as rated by the independent investment rating services standard and poor's (s&p)/ moody's investors service (moody's). the portfolio is externally managed by independent, professional investment managers and is broadly diversified across geographies, sectors, and issuers. other investments principally comprise direct investments, investment funds, and limited partnerships. we hold no collateralized debt obligations or collateralized loan obligations in our investment portfolio, and we provide no credit default protection. we have long-standing global credit limits for our entire portfolio across the organization. exposures are aggregated, monitored, and actively managed by our global credit committee, comprising senior executives, including our chief financial officer, our chief risk officer, our chief investment officer, and our treasurer. we also have well-established, strict contractual investment rules requiring managers to maintain highly diversified exposures to individual issuers and closely monitor investment manager compliance with portfolio guidelines.
the average duration of our fixed income securities, including the effect of options and swaps, was 3.5 and 4.0 years at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the decrease in duration in 2015 was primarily due to investment portfolio asset allocation changes toward higher short-term holdings in anticipation of the chubb acquisition in early 2016. we estimate that a 100 basis point (bps) increase in interest rates would reduce the valuation of our fixed income portfolio by approximately $2.2 billion at december 31, 2015.

municipal as part of our overall investment strategy, we may invest in states, municipalities, and other political subdivisions fixed maturity securities (municipal). we apply the same investment selection process described previously to our municipal investments. the portfolio is highly diversified primarily in state general obligation bonds and essential service revenue bonds including education and utilities (water, power, and sewers).
our exposure to the euro results primarily from chubb european group which is headquartered in london and offers a broad range of coverages throughout the european union, central, and eastern europe. chubb primarily invests in euro denominated investments to support its local currency insurance obligations and required capital levels. chubb's local currency investment portfolios have strict contractual investment guidelines requiring managers to maintain a high quality and diversified portfolio to both sector and individual issuers. investment portfolios are monitored daily to ensure investment manager compliance with portfolio guidelines.
our non-u.s. investment grade fixed income portfolios are currency-matched with the insurance liabilities of our non-u.s. operations. the average credit quality of our non-u.s. fixed income securities is a and 53 percent of our holdings are rated aaa or guaranteed by governments or quasi-government agencies. within the context of these investment portfolios, our government and corporate bond holdings are highly diversified across industries and geographies. issuer limits are based on credit rating (aa-two percent, a-one percent, bbb-0.5 percent of the total portfolio) and are monitored daily via an internal compliance system. because of this investment approach, we do not have a direct exposure to troubled sovereign borrowers in europe. we manage our indirect exposure using the same credit rating based investment approach. accordingly, we do not believe our indirect exposure is material.

below-investment grade corporate fixed income portfolio below-investment grade securities have different characteristics than investment grade corporate debt securities. risk of loss from default by the borrower is greater with below-investment grade securities. below-investment grade securities are generally unsecured and are often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer. also, issuers of below-investment grade securities usually have higher levels of debt and are more sensitive to adverse economic conditions, such as recession or increasing interest rates, than investment grade issuers. at december 31, 2015, our corporate fixed income investment portfolio included below-investment grade and non-rated securities which, in total, comprised approximately 10 percent of our fixed income portfolio. our below-investment grade and non-rated portfolio includes over 1,000 issuers, with the greatest single exposure being $113 million.
we manage high-yield bonds as a distinct and separate asset class from investment grade bonds. the allocation to high-yield bonds is explicitly set by internal management and is targeted to securities in the upper tier of credit quality (bb/b). our minimum rating for initial purchase is bb/b. six external investment managers are responsible for high-yield security selection and portfolio construction. our high-yield managers have a conservative approach to credit selection and very low historical default experience. holdings are highly diversified across industries and generally subject to a 1.5 percent issuer limit as a percentage of high-yield allocation. we monitor position limits daily through an internal compliance system. derivative and structured securities (e.g., credit default swaps and collateralized loan obligations) are not permitted in the high-yield portfolio.
reinsurance recoverable on policy benefits                                         $187                      $217
we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and potential reinsurers on a regular basis and also monitor concentrations of credit risk with reinsurers. the provision for uncollectible reinsurance is required principally due to the potential failure of reinsurers to indemnify us, primarily because of disputes under reinsurance contracts and insolvencies. the provision for uncollectible reinsurance is based on a default analysis applied to gross reinsurance recoverables, net of approximately $2.6 billion and $2.4 billion of collateral at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the decrease in net reinsurance recoverable on loss and loss expenses was primarily due to the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, favorable ppd, and collections relating to run-off operations, partially offset by higher non-catastrophe large losses.
asbestos and environmental (a&e) reserving considerations for asbestos, chubb faces claims relating to policies issued to manufacturers, distributors, installers, and other parties in the chain of commerce for asbestos and products containing asbestos. claimants will generally allege damages across an extended time period which may coincide with multiple policies covering a wide range of time periods for a single insured.
environmental claims present exposure for remediation and defense costs associated with the contamination of property as a result of pollution. it is common, especially for larger defendants, to be named as a potentially responsible party at multiple sites.
the following table presents count information for asbestos claims by causative agent and environmental claims by site, for direct policies only:
asbestos (by causative agent)              environmental (by site)
the increase in newly reported environmental sites in 2015 were primarily for administrative purposes to process settlement payments.
aggressive settlement practices, variations in gross to ceded relationships within the asbestos or environmental claims, and levels of coverage provided. we, therefore, urge caution in using these very simplistic ratios to gauge reserve adequacy.
catastrophe management we actively monitor our catastrophe risk accumulation around the world. the table below presents our modeled annual aggregate pre-tax probable maximum loss (pml), net of reinsurance, for 100-year and 250-year return periods for u.s. hurricane and california earthquake at december 31, 2015 and 2014. the table also presents chubb's corresponding share of pre-tax industry losses for each of the return periods for u.s. hurricane and california earthquake. for example, according to the model, for the 1-in-100 return period scenario, there is a one percent chance that our losses incurred in any year from u.s. hurricane events could be in excess of $1,700 million (or 5.8 percent of our total shareholders' equity at december 31, 2015). we estimate that at such hypothetical loss levels, chubb's share of aggregate industry losses would be approximately 1.1 percent.

natural catastrophe property reinsurance program chubb's core property catastrophe reinsurance program provides protection against natural catastrophes impacting its primary property operations (i.e., excluding our global reinsurance and life segments).
we regularly review our reinsurance protection and corresponding property catastrophe exposures. this may or may not lead to the purchase of additional reinsurance prior to a program's renewal date. in addition, prior to each renewal date, we consider how much, if any, coverage we intend to buy and we may make material changes to the current structure in light of various factors, including modeled pml assessment at various return periods, reinsurance pricing, our risk tolerance and exposures, and various other structuring considerations.
chubb purchases a global property catastrophe reinsurance program for our north american and international operations. the program is effective july 1, 2015 through june 30, 2016, and consists of three layers in excess of losses retained by chubb. in addition, we also purchased terrorism coverage (excluding nuclear, biological, chemical and radiation coverage) for the united states from july 1, 2015 to june 30, 2016 with the same limits and retention and percentage placed except that the majority of terrorism coverage is on an aggregate basis above our retentions without a reinstatement. a majority of the program, excess of a $1 billion attachment point, also includes biological and chemical terrorism coverage for the personal lines exposures in those states that mandate such coverage.

(sovereign), and through a unit of our london-based agm operation. sovereign is one of the world's leading underwriters of political risk insurance and has a global portfolio spread across more than 100 countries. its clients include financial institutions, national export credit agencies, leading multilateral agencies, and multinational corporations. agm writes political risk, trade credit, and structured trade credit business out of underwriting offices in london, england; hamburg, germany; sao paulo, brazil; singapore; tokyo, japan; and in the u.s. in the following locations: new york, new york; los angeles, california; and washington, d.c.
our political risk insurance provides protection to commercial lenders against defaults on cross border loans, insulates investors against equity losses, and protects exporters against defaults on contracts. commercial lenders, our largest client segment, are covered for missed scheduled loan repayments due to acts of confiscation, expropriation or nationalization by the host government, currency inconvertibility or exchange transfer restrictions, or war or other acts of political violence. in addition, in the case of loans to government-owned entities or loans that have a government guarantee, political risk policies cover scheduled payments against risks of non-payment or non-honoring of government guarantees. equity investors and corporations receive similar coverage to that of lenders, except they are protected against financial losses, inability to repatriate dividends, and physical damage to their operations caused by covered events. our export contracts protection provides coverage for both exporters and their financing banks against the risk of contract frustration due to government actions, including non-payment by government entities.
agm's trade credit and structured trade credit businesses cover losses due to insolvency, protracted default, and political risk perils including export and license cancellation. our core trade credit product provides coverage to larger companies that have sophisticated credit risk management systems, with exposure to multiple customers and that have the ability to self-insure losses up to a certain level through excess of loss coverage. its structured trade credit business provides coverage to trade finance banks, exporters, and trading companies, with exposure to trade-related financing instruments.
we have implemented structural features in our policies in order to control potential losses within the political risk, trade credit, and structured credit businesses. these include basic loss sharing features that include co-insurance and deductibles, and in the case of trade credit, the use of non-qualifying losses that drop smaller exposures deemed too difficult to assess. ultimate loss severity is also limited by using waiting periods to enable the insurer and insured to agree on recovery strategies, and the subrogation of the rights of the lender/exporter to the insurer following a claim. we have the option to pay claims over the original loan payment schedule, rather than in a lump sum in order to provide insureds and the insurer additional time to remedy problems and work towards full recoveries. it is important to note that political risk, trade credit, and structured trade credit policies are named peril conditional contracts, not financial guarantees, and claims are only paid after conditions and warranties are fulfilled. political risk, trade credit, and structured trade credit insurance do not cover currency devaluations, bond defaults, any form of derivatives, movements in overseas equity markets, transactions deemed illegal, or situations where corruption or misrepresentation has occurred, or debt that is not legally enforceable. in addition to assessing and mitigating potential exposure on a policy-by-policy basis, we also have specific risk management measures in place to manage overall exposure and risk. these measures include placing country and individual transaction limits based on country risk and credit ratings, combined single loss limits on multi-country policies, the use of reinsurance protection, and regular modeling and stress-testing of the portfolio.
crop insurance we are, and have been since the 1980s, one of the leading writers of crop insurance in the u.s. and have conducted that business through a managing general agent subsidiary of rain and hail. we provide protection throughout the u.s. on a variety of crops and are therefore geographically diversified, which reduces the risk of exposure to a single event or a heavy accumulation of losses in any one region. our crop insurance business comprises two components - multiple peril crop insurance (mpci) and crop-hail insurance.
the mpci program is offered in conjunction with the u.s. department of agriculture (usda). the policies cover revenue shortfalls or production losses due to natural causes such as drought, excessive moisture, hail, wind, frost, insects, and disease. generally, policies have deductibles ranging from 10 percent to 50 percent of the insured's risk. the usda's risk management agency (rma) sets the policy terms and conditions, rates and forms, and is also responsible for setting compliance standards. as a participating company, we report all details of policies underwritten to the rma and are party to a standard reinsurance agreement (sra). the sra sets out the relationship between private insurance companies and the federal crop insurance corporation (fcic) concerning the terms and conditions regarding the risks each will bear including the pro-rata and state stop-loss provisions which allows companies to limit the exposure of any one state or group of states on their underwriting results. in addition to the pro-rata and excess of loss reinsurance protections inherent in the sra, we also purchase third-party proportional and stop-loss reinsurance for our mpci business to reduce our exposure. we may also enter into crop derivative contracts to further manage our risk exposure.
each year the rma issues a final sra for the subsequent reinsurance year. in june 2015, the rma released the 2016 sra which establishes the terms and conditions for the 2016 reinsurance year (i.e., july 1, 2015 through june 30, 2016) that replaced the 2015 sra. there were no significant changes in the terms and conditions, and therefore the new sra does not materially impact chubb's outlook on the crop program relative to 2016.
on the mpci business, we recognize net premiums written as soon as estimable, which is generally when we receive acreage reports from the policyholders on the various crops throughout the u.s. this allows us to best determine the premium associated with the liability that is being planted. the mpci program has specific timeframes as to when producers must report acreage to us and in certain cases, the reporting occurs after the close of the respective reinsurance year. once the net premium written has been recorded, the premium is then earned over the growing season for the crops. a majority of the crops that are covered in the program are typically subject to the sra in effect at the beginning of the year. given the major crops covered in the program, we typically see a substantial written and earned premium impact in the second and third quarters.
the pricing of mpci premium is determined using a number of factors including commodity prices and related volatility. for instance, in most states the pricing for the mpci revenue product for corn includes a factor that is based on the average price in february of the chicago board of trade december corn futures. to the extent that the corn commodity prices are higher in february than they were in the previous february, and all other factors are the same, the increase in corn prices will increase the corn premium year over year.
our crop-hail program is a private offering. premium is earned on the crop-hail program over the coverage period of the policy. given the very short nature of the growing season, most crop-hail business is typically written in the second and third quarters with the earned premium also more heavily occurring during this time frame. we use industry data to develop our own rates and forms for the coverage offered. the policy primarily protects farmers against yield reduction caused by hail and/or fire, and related costs such as transit to storage. we offer various deductibles to allow the grower to partially self-insure for a reduced premium cost. we limit our crop-hail exposures through the use of township liability limits and third-party proportional and stop-loss reinsurance on our net retained hail business.
liquidity liquidity is a measure of a company's ability to generate cash flows sufficient to meet short-term and long-term cash requirements. as a holding company, chubb limited possesses assets that consist primarily of the stock of its subsidiaries and other investments. in addition to net investment income, chubb limited's cash flows depend primarily on dividends or other statutorily permissible payments. historically, these dividends and other payments have come from chubb's bermuda-based operating subsidiaries, which we refer to as our bermuda subsidiaries. our consolidated sources of funds consist primarily of net premiums written, fees, net investment income, and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. funds are used at our various companies primarily to pay claims, operating expenses, and dividends, to service debt, to purchase investments, and to fund acquisitions.
we anticipate that positive cash flows from operations (underwriting activities and investment income) should be sufficient to cover cash outflows under most loss scenarios for the near term. should the need arise, we generally have access to capital markets and available credit facilities. in december 2015, we increased our existing $1.0 billion unsecured operational letters of credit (loc) facility from $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion with the consent of the issuers. refer to "credit facilities" below for additional information. our access to funds under an existing credit facility is dependent on the ability of the bank that is a party to the facility to meet its funding commitments. our existing credit facility has a remaining term expiring in november 2017 and requires that we maintain certain financial covenants, all of which we met at december 31, 2015. should our existing credit provider experience financial difficulty, we may be required to replace credit sources, possibly in a difficult market. if we cannot obtain adequate capital or sources of credit on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. to date, we have not experienced difficulty accessing our credit facility.
to further ensure the sufficiency of funds to settle unforeseen claims, we hold certain invested assets in cash and short-term investments. in addition, for certain insurance, reinsurance, or deposit contracts that tend to have relatively large and reasonably predictable cash outflows, we attempt to establish dedicated portfolios of assets that are duration-matched with the related liabilities. with respect to the duration of our overall investment portfolio, we manage asset durations to both maximize return given current market conditions and provide sufficient liquidity to cover future loss payments. all things being equal, in a low interest rate environment, the overall duration of our fixed maturities tends to be shorter and in a high interest rate environment, such duration tends to be longer. at december 31, 2015, the average duration of our fixed maturities (3.5 years) is less than the average expected duration of our insurance liabilities (4.8 years).
despite our safeguards, if paid losses accelerate beyond our ability to fund such paid losses from current operating cash flows, we might need to either liquidate a portion of our investment portfolio or arrange for financing. potential events causing such a liquidity strain could include several significant catastrophes occurring in a relatively short period of time, large uncollectible reinsurance recoverables on paid losses (as a result of coverage disputes, reinsurers' credit problems, or decreases in the value of collateral supporting reinsurance recoverables) or increases in collateral postings under our variable annuity reinsurance business. because each subsidiary focuses on a more limited number of specific product lines than is collectively available from the chubb group of companies, the mix of business tends to be less diverse at the subsidiary level. as a result, the probability of a liquidity strain, as described above, may be greater for individual subsidiaries than when liquidity is assessed on a consolidated basis. if such a liquidity strain were to occur in a subsidiary, we could be required to liquidate a portion of our investments, potentially at distressed prices, as well as be required to contribute capital to the particular subsidiary and/or curtail dividends from the subsidiary to support holding company operations.
the payment of dividends or other statutorily permissible distributions from our operating companies are subject to the laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction, as well as the need to maintain capital levels adequate to support the insurance and reinsurance operations, including financial strength ratings issued by independent rating agencies. during 2015, we were able to meet all of our obligations, including the payments of dividends on our common shares, with our net cash flows.
we assess which subsidiaries to draw dividends from based on a number of factors. considerations such as regulatory and legal restrictions as well as the subsidiary's financial condition are paramount to the dividend decision. chubb limited received dividends of $5.0 billion and $300 million from its bermuda subsidiaries in 2015 and 2014, respectively. $2.7 billion of the 2015 dividends were paid in 2015, while the remainder were paid in 2016. the dividends received in 2015 included $5.0 billion used to finance a portion of the chubb acquisition in 2016. chubb limited received dividends of $261 million and nil from its switzerland subsidiaries in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
the payment of any dividends from agm or its subsidiaries is subject to applicable u.k. insurance laws and regulations.  in addition, the release of funds by syndicate 2488 to subsidiaries of agm is subject to regulations promulgated by the society of lloyd's. chubb limited received no dividends from agm in 2015 and 2014.
the u.s. insurance subsidiaries of ace ina holdings inc. (ace ina) may pay dividends, without prior regulatory approval, subject to restrictions set out in state law of the subsidiary's domicile (or, if applicable, commercial domicile). ace ina's international subsidiaries are also subject to insurance laws and regulations particular to the countries in which the subsidiaries operate. these laws and regulations sometimes include restrictions that limit the amount of dividends payable without prior approval of regulatory insurance authorities. chubb limited received no dividends from ace ina in 2015 and 2014. debt issued by ace ina is serviced by statutorily permissible distributions by ace ina's insurance subsidiaries to ace ina as well as other group resources. ace ina received $833 million of dividends from its subsidiaries in 2015 and $401 million of dividends from its subsidiaries in 2014, of which $374 million was paid in cash. at december 31, 2015, the amount of dividends available to be paid to ace ina in 2016 from its subsidiaries without prior approval of insurance regulatory authorities totals $1.0 billion.
ace ina also received $5.1 billion in capital contributions in 2015, of which $2.8 billion were paid in 2015, while the remainder were paid in 2016. $5.0 billion of these capital contributions were sourced from the dividends from the bermuda subsidiaries to fund the chubb acquisition as noted above.
cash flows our insurance and reinsurance operations provide liquidity in that premiums are received in advance, sometimes substantially in advance, of the time claims are paid. generally, cash flows are affected by claim payments that, due to the nature of our operations, may comprise large loss payments on a limited number of claims and which can fluctuate significantly from period to period. the irregular timing of these loss payments can create significant variations in cash flows from operations between periods. refer to "contractual obligations and commitments" for our estimate of future claim payments by period. sources of liquidity include cash from operations, routine sales of investments, and financing arrangements. the following is a discussion of our cash flows for 2015, 2014, and 2013.
operating cash flows reflect net income for each period, adjusted for non-cash items and changes in working capital.
cash used for investing was $6.3 billion in 2015, compared with $2.5 billion and $4.4 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the increase in cash used for investing of $3.8 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to changes in our investment portfolios, principally an increase in short-term investments, to fund the chubb acquisition. this decrease was offset by a net cash inflow of $264 million related to the purchase of fireman's fund (cash paid of $365 million, netted with cash acquired of $629 million). this compares to cash used for acquisitions of $766 million in 2014. the decrease in cash used for investing of $1.9 billion in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to lower net purchases of fixed maturities.
cash from (used for) financing was $3.7 billion in 2015, compared with $(1.8) billion in 2014, and $391 million in 2013. cash from financing in 2015 included $4.9 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt (net of repayments) partially offset by $862 million of dividends paid on common shares and $758 million of share repurchases. cash used for financing in 2014 included $1.4 billion of share repurchases and $862 million of dividends paid on common shares. cash flows from financing in 2013 included $947 million of proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by dividends paid on common shares of $517 million. dividends paid on common shares in 2015 were flat compared to 2014 as the three percent increase in our quarterly dividend beginning with the payment made in july 2015 was offset by fewer shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases in 2015. dividends paid on common shares were higher in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to a $0.12 per share increase in our quarterly dividend beginning with the payment made in january 2014 and an additional three percent increase beginning with the payment made in august 2014.
both internal and external forces influence our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. claim settlements, premium levels, and investment returns may be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions. in many cases, significant periods of time, ranging up to several years or more, may lapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us, and the settlement of the liability for that loss.
in the current low interest rate environment, we use repurchase agreements as a low-cost alternative for short-term funding needs and to address short-term cash timing differences without disrupting our investment portfolio holdings. at december 31, 2015, there were $1.4 billion in repurchase agreements outstanding.
in addition to cash from operations, routine sales of investments, and financing arrangements, we have agreements with a third-party bank provider which implemented two international multi-currency notional cash pooling programs to enhance cash management efficiency during periods of short-term timing mismatches between expected inflows and outflows of cash by currency. the programs allow us to optimize investment income by avoiding portfolio disruption. in each program, participating chubb entities establish deposit accounts in different currencies with the bank provider. each day the credit or debit balances in every account are notionally translated into a single currency (u.s. dollars) and then notionally pooled. the bank extends overdraft credit to all participating chubb entities as needed, provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in each pool at the end of each day is at least zero. actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between legal entities. chubb entities may incur overdraft balances as a means to address short-term liquidity needs. any overdraft balances incurred under this program by a chubb entity would be guaranteed by chubb limited (up to $300 million in the aggregate). our syndicated letter of credit facility allows for same day drawings to fund a net pool overdraft should participating chubb entities withdraw contributed funds from the pool.
capital resources capital resources consist of funds deployed or available to be deployed to support our business operations.

in march 2015, we issued $800 million of 3.15 percent senior notes due march 2025. the proceeds from the debt issuance are expected to be used to repay at maturity $500 million of 5.7 percent senior notes due february 2017 and $300 million of 5.8 percent senior notes due march 2018. in may 2015, ace ina's $450 million of 5.6 percent senior notes matured and were fully paid. in november 2015, we issued $5.3 billion of senior notes, the proceeds of which were used to finance a portion of the chubb acquisition as discussed below. in november 2015, ace ina's $700 million of 2.6 percent senior notes matured and were fully paid. for a discussion of our debt outstanding, refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
on january 14, 2016, we acquired the chubb corporation for approximately $29.5 billion, comprising $14.3 billion in cash and $15.2 billion in newly-issued stock, based on the chubb limited (formerly ace limited) closing price on the acquisition date. in addition, we assumed outstanding equity awards to employees, directors, and consultants with an attributed value of approximately $340 million. we financed the cash portion of the transaction through a combination of $9 billion sourced from various chubb limited and chubb corporation companies plus $5.3 billion of senior notes as discussed above. refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
as part of the acquisition of the chubb corporation, we assumed all of its senior and subordinated debt obligations, totaling $3.3 billion par value, which is guaranteed by chubb limited. junior subordinated capital securities of $1 billion bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.375 percent through april 14, 2017 and at a rate equal to the three-month libor rate plus 2.25 percent thereafter. if the current three-month libor rate is not substantially higher in early 2017, and the near-term expectations are similar, it is our expectation that these securities would not be redeemed at the reset date. however, our expectations are subject to change depending on market conditions and other factors.
we believe our financial strength provides us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain available funds externally through debt or equity financing on both a short-term and long-term basis. our ability to access the capital markets is dependent on, among other things, market conditions and our perceived financial strength. we have accessed both the debt and equity markets from time to time. we generally maintain the ability to issue certain classes of debt and equity securities via an unlimited sec shelf registration which is renewed every three years. this allows us capital market access for refinancing as well as for unforeseen or opportunistic capital needs. in october 2015, we filed a new unlimited shelf registration which allows us to issue certain classes of debt and equity. this shelf registration expires in october 2018.
as part of our capital management program, in november 2014, our board of directors (board) authorized the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of chubb's common shares through december 31, 2015 to replace the prior repurchase authorization of $2.0 billion of chubb's shares when it expired on december 31, 2014. we repurchased $734 million, $1,449 million, and $290 million of common shares in a series of open market transactions in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. at this time, management has elected to discontinue share repurchases. there are no outstanding share repurchase authorizations at december 31, 2015. as of december 31, 2015, there were 18,268,971 common shares in treasury with a weighted average cost of $105.22 per share.
at our may 2015 annual general meeting, our shareholders approved an annual dividend for the following year of up to $2.68 per share, expected to be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.67 per share after the annual general meeting by way of a distribution from capital contribution reserves (additional paid-in-capital), transferred to free reserves for payment (retained earnings). the board will determine the record and payment dates at which the annual dividend may be paid, and is authorized to abstain from distributing a dividend at its discretion, until the date of the 2016 annual general meeting. the first three quarterly installments, each of $0.67 per share, have been distributed by the board as expected. refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our dividends.
contractual obligations and commitments the following table presents our future payments due by period under contractual obligations at december 31, 2015:
(in millions of u.s. dollars)                                                                   total          2016            and 2018            and 2020          thereafter payment amounts determinable from the respective contracts deposit liabilities(1)                                                                         $1,259                 $23                        $45                        $35              $1,156

estimated payments for future policy benefits                                                  20,090                 814                      1,786                      1,498              15,992
total contractual obligations and commitments                                                 $76,604             $12,558                    $13,822                     $9,512             $40,712
(2)   primarily comprises audit fees and agreements with vendors to purchase system software administration and maintenance services.
(3)   the timing of the payments of these commitments is uncertain and will differ from the estimated timing in the table.
the above table excludes the following items:
•   pension obligations: minimum funding requirements for our pension obligations are immaterial. subsequent funding commitments are apt to vary due to many factors and are difficult to estimate at this time. refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
•   liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits: the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest, was $16 million at december 31, 2015. we recognize accruals for interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. at december 31, 2015, we had $4 million in liabilities for income tax-related interest and penalties in our consolidated balance sheets. we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate for the timing of cash settlement with respect to these liabilities. refer to note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
we have no other significant contractual obligations or commitments not reflected in the table above. we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.
estimated gross loss payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts we are obligated to pay claims under insurance and reinsurance contracts for specified loss events covered under those contracts. such loss payments represent our most significant future payment obligation as a p&c insurance and reinsurance company. in contrast to other contractual obligations, cash payments are not determinable from the terms specified within the contract. for example, we do not ultimately make a payment to our counterparty for many insurance and reinsurance contracts
(i.e., when a loss event has not occurred) and if a payment is to be made, the amount and timing cannot be determined from the contract. in the table above, we estimate payments by period relating to our gross liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses included in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2015, and do not take into account reinsurance recoverable. these estimated loss payments are inherently uncertain and the amount and timing of actual loss payments are likely to differ from these estimates and the differences could be material. given the numerous factors and assumptions involved in both estimates of loss and loss expense reserves and related estimates as to the timing of future loss and loss expense payments in the table above, differences between actual and estimated loss payments will not necessarily indicate a commensurate change in ultimate loss estimates. the liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses presented in our balance sheet is discounted for certain structured settlements for which the timing and amount of future claim payments are reliably determinable and certain reserves for unsettled claims that are discounted in statutory filings. accordingly, the estimated amounts in the table exceed the liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses presented in our balance sheet. refer to note 1 h) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
estimated payments for future policy benefits we establish reserves for future policy benefits for life, long-term health, and annuity contracts.  the amounts in the table are gross of fees or premiums due from the underlying contracts. the liability for future policy benefits for life, long-term health, and annuity contracts presented in our balance sheet is discounted and reflected net of fees or premiums due from the underlying contracts.  accordingly, the estimated amounts in the table exceed the liability for future policy benefits presented in our balance sheet.  payment amounts related to these reserves must be estimated and are not determinable from the contract.  due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing and amount of these payments, actual results could materially differ from the estimates in the table.
credit facilities as our bermuda subsidiaries are non-admitted insurers and reinsurers in the u.s., the terms of certain u.s. insurance and reinsurance contracts require them to provide collateral, which can be in the form of letters of credit (locs). locs may also be used for general corporate purposes.
in december 2015, we increased our existing $1.0 billion unsecured operational loc facility guaranteed by chubb limited expiring in november 2017 to $1.5 billion with the consent of the issuers. we are allowed to use up to $300 million of this loc facility as an unsecured revolving credit facility. at december 31, 2015, outstanding locs issued under this facility were $797 million.
it is anticipated that our $1.5 billion unsecured operational loc facility will be renewed on expiry but such renewal is subject to the availability of credit from banks utilized by chubb. in the event that such credit support is insufficient, we could be required to provide alternative security to clients. this could take the form of additional insurance trusts supported by our investment portfolio or funds withheld using our cash resources. the value of locs required is driven by, among other things, statutory liabilities reported by variable annuity guarantee reinsurance clients, loss development of existing reserves, the payment pattern of such reserves, the expansion of business, and loss experience of such business.
the facility noted above requires that we maintain certain covenants, all of which have been met at december 31, 2015. these covenants include:
(ii)   maintenance of a maximum debt to total capitalization ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1. under this covenant, debt does not include repurchase agreements, trust preferred securities or mezzanine equity, except where the ratio of the sum of trust preferred securities and mezzanine equity to total capitalization is greater than 15 percent. in this circumstance, the amount greater than 15 percent would be included in the financial debt to total capitalization ratio.
financial debt to total capitalization was .243 to 1, which is below the maximum debt to total capitalization ratio of 0.35 to 1 as described in (ii) above.
our failure to comply with the covenants under any credit facility would, subject to grace periods in the case of certain covenants, result in an event of default. this could require us to repay any outstanding borrowings or to cash collateralize locs under such facility. our failure to repay material financial obligations, as well as our failure with respect to certain other events expressly identified, would result in an event of default under the facility.
ratings chubb limited and its subsidiaries are assigned credit and financial strength (insurance) ratings from internationally recognized rating agencies, including s&p, a.m. best, moody's, and fitch. the ratings issued on our companies by these agencies are announced publicly and are available directly from the agencies. our internet site (investors.chubb.com, under resources) also contains some information about our ratings, but such information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this report.
financial strength ratings reflect the rating agencies' opinions of a company's claims paying ability. independent ratings are one of the important factors that establish our competitive position in the insurance markets. the rating agencies consider many factors in determining the financial strength rating of an insurance company, including the relative level of statutory surplus necessary to support the business operations of the company. these ratings are based upon factors relevant to policyholders, agents, and intermediaries and are not directed toward the protection of investors. such ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities.
credit ratings assess a company's ability to make timely payments of principal and interest on its debt.
it is possible that, in the future, one or more of the rating agencies may reduce our existing ratings. if one or more of our ratings were downgraded, we could incur higher borrowing costs, and our ability to access the capital markets could be impacted. in addition, our insurance and reinsurance operations could be adversely impacted by a downgrade in our financial strength ratings, including a possible reduction in demand for our products in certain markets. also, we have insurance and reinsurance contracts which contain rating triggers. in the event the s&p or a.m. best financial strength ratings of chubb fall, we may be faced with the cancellation of premium or be required to post collateral on our underlying obligation associated with this premium. we estimate that at december 31, 2015, a one-notch downgrade of our s&p or a.m. best financial strength ratings would result in an immaterial loss of premium or requirement for collateral to be posted.

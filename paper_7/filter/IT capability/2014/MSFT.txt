item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management's discussion and analysis ("md&a") is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of microsoft corporation. md&a is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to financial statements.
overview microsoft is a technology leader focused on being the productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and cloud-first world. we strive to reinvent productivity to empower people and organizations to do more and achieve more. we create technology that transforms the way people work, play, and communicate across a wide range of computing devices.
we generate revenue by developing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products, by offering an array of services, including cloud-based services to consumers and businesses, by designing, manufacturing, and selling devices that integrate with our cloud-based services, and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees, designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services, datacenter costs in support of our cloud-based services, and income taxes.
industry trends our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. at microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers, industry trends, and competitive forces.
key opportunities and investments we see significant opportunities for growth by investing research and development resources in the following areas:
   digital work and life experiences part ii item 7
with investments in these areas, we work to fulfill the evolving needs of our customers in a mobile-first and cloud-first world. we view mobility broadly  not just by devices, but by experiences. today, people move just as quickly into new contexts as to new locations. mobility goes beyond devices users carry with them as they move from place to place, to encompass the rich collection of data, applications, and services that accompany them as they move from setting to setting in their lives. many of our customers are "dual users," employing technology for work or school and also deeply in their personal lives.
digital work and life experiences we believe we can significantly enhance the digital lives of our customers using our broad portfolio of communication, productivity, and information services. we work to deliver digital work and life experiences that are reinvented for the mobile-first and cloud-first world. productivity will be the first and foremost objective, to enable people to meet and collaborate more easily, and to effectively express ideas in new ways. we will design applications as dual use with the intelligence to partition data between work and life while respecting each person's privacy choices. the foundation for these efforts will rest on advancing our leading productivity, collaboration, and business process tools including skype, onedrive, onenote, outlook, word, excel, powerpoint, bing, and dynamics.
we see opportunity in combining these services in new ways that are more contextual and personal, while ensuring people, rather than their devices, remain at the center of the digital experience. we will offer our services across ecosystems and devices outside our own. as people move from device to device, so will their content and the richness of their services. we will engineer applications so users can find, try, and buy them in friction-free ways.
cloud operating system today, businesses face important opportunities and challenges. enterprises are asked to deploy technology that advances business strategy. they decide what solutions will make employees more productive, collaborative, and satisfied, or connect with customers in new and compelling ways. they work to unlock business insights from a world of data. they rely on our technology to manage employee corporate identity, and to manage and secure corporate information accessed and stored across a growing number of devices. to achieve these objectives increasingly businesses look to leverage the benefits of the cloud. helping businesses move to the cloud is one of our largest opportunities, and we believe we work from a position of strength.
the shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale: larger datacenters can deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; larger datacenters can coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds. the cloud creates the opportunity for businesses to focus on innovation while leaving non-differentiating activities to reliable and cost-effective providers.
with azure, we are one of very few cloud vendors that run at a scale that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities. we believe the combination of azure and windows server makes us the only company with a public, private, and hybrid cloud platform that can power modern business. we are working to enhance the return on it investment by enabling enterprises to combine their existing datacenters and our public cloud into a single cohesive infrastructure. businesses can deploy applications in their own datacenter, a partner's datacenter, or in our datacenters with common security, management, and administration across all environments, with the flexibility and scale they desire.
our cloud will also enable richer employee experiences. we enable organizations to securely adopt software-as-a-service applications (both our own and third-party) and integrate them with their existing security and management infrastructure. we will continue to innovate with higher level services including identity and directory services, rich data storage and analytics services, machine learning services, media services, web, and mobile backend services, and developer productivity services. to foster a rich developer ecosystem, our digital work part ii item 7
and life experiences will also be extensible, enabling customers and partners to further customize and enhance our solutions, achieving even more value. our strategy requires continuing investment in datacenters and other infrastructure to support our devices and services, and will bring continued competition with google, amazon, and other well-established and emerging competitors.
device operating system and hardware with our windows device operating system and first-party hardware, we strive to set the standard for productivity experiences. we aim to deliver the richest and most consistent user experience for digital work and life scenarios on screens of all sizes  from phones, tablets, and laptops to tvs and large, multi-touch displays. we are investing to make windows the most secure, manageable, and capable operating system for the needs of a modern workforce. we are working to create a broad developer opportunity by enabling universal windows applications to run across all device targets. we are developing new input/output methods like speech, pen, and gesture to power more personal computing experiences.
we work with an ecosystem of partners to deliver a broad spectrum of windows devices. we also build first-party hardware to set the standard for productivity experiences and stimulate more demand for the entire windows ecosystem, as we do with surface, and with the acquisition of substantially all nokia corporation's ("nokia") devices and services business ("nds") on april 25, 2014, phones. as consumer services and hardware advance, we expect they will continue to better complement one another, connecting the devices people use daily to unique communications, productivity, and entertainment services from microsoft and our partners and developers. we anticipate many new mobile device categories and we anticipate experiences to emerge that span a variety of devices of all screen sizes. we will invest to be on the forefront of this innovation focusing on dual users and their needs across work and life. with the acquisition of nds, we expect our effective tax rate to increase as our business mix changes.
our future opportunity there are several distinct areas of technology that we aim to drive forward. our goal is to lead the industry in these areas over the long term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth. we are investing significant resources in:
   delivering new high-value digital work and digital life experiences to improve how people learn, work, play, and interact with one another.
   establishing our windows platform across the pc, tablet, phone, server, other devices, and the cloud to drive a thriving ecosystem of developers, unify the cross-device user experience, and increase agility when bringing new advances to market.
   building and running cloud-based services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals.
   applying machine learning to make technology more intuitive and able to act on our behalf, instead of at our command.
we believe the breadth of our products and services portfolio, our large, global partner and customer base, our growing ecosystem, and our ongoing investment in innovation position us to be a leader in these areas.
economic conditions, challenges, and risks the market for software, devices, and cloud-based services is dynamic and highly competitive. our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. the devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud and in some cases the user's choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. we must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. to support our strategy of part ii item 7
reinventing productivity to empower every person and every organization to do more and achieve more, we announced a restructuring plan in july 2014. through this restructuring, we strive to increase agility, streamline engineering processes, move faster and more efficiently, and simplify our organization. even if we achieve these goals, the investments we are making in devices and infrastructure will increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.
we prioritize our investments among the highest long-term growth opportunities. these investments require significant resources and are multi-year in nature. the products and services we bring to market may be developed internally, as part of a partnership or alliance, or through acquisition.
our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. we hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. microsoft competes for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one's career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. see a discussion of these factors and other risks under risk factors (part i, item 1a of this form 10-k).
   revenue deferred on certain devices bundled with other products and services ("bundled offerings"); and
   revenue deferred on sales of windows 7 with an option to upgrade to windows 8 pro at a discounted price (the "windows upgrade offer").
if our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable.
reportable segments the segment amounts included in md&a are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. segment information appearing in note 21  segment information and geographic data of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) is also presented on this basis. all differences between our internal management reporting basis and accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. ("u.s. gaap"), along with certain corporate-level and other activity, are included in corporate and other. operating expenses are not allocated to our segments.
during the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we changed our organizational structure as part of our transformation to a devices and services company. as a result, information that our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance changed. therefore, we have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during fiscal year 2014. our reportable segments are described below.
on april 25, 2014, we acquired substantially all of nds for total consideration of $9.5 billion. this amount was greater than the $7.2 billion disclosed previously, primarily due to $1.5 billion of cash acquired, foreign currency movements of $330 million, working capital adjustments of $210 million, and other adjustments of $260 million. see note 9  business combinations of the notes to financial statements for additional details. nds has been included in our consolidated results of operations starting on the acquisition date. we report the financial performance of the acquired business in our new phone hardware segment. prior to the acquisition of nds, financial results associated with our joint strategic initiatives with nokia were reflected in our d&c licensing segment. the contractual relationship with nokia related to those initiatives terminated in conjunction with the acquisition. with the creation of the new phone hardware segment, the d&c hardware segment was renamed computing and gaming hardware in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014.

fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012
sales and marketing expenses grew, reflecting an $898 million increase in advertising costs associated primarily with windows 8 and surface, $181 million higher fees paid to third-party software advisors, and a $145 million or 2% increase in headcount-related expenses.

general and administrative expenses decreased $328 million or 6%, due mainly to the eu fine in the prior year, offset in part by higher business taxes, higher costs for internal use software capitalized in the prior year, and nds expenses. nds general and administrative expenses were $77 million during fiscal year 2014.
fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012
general and administrative expenses increased, primarily due to legal charges for the eu fine.

goodwill impairment we test goodwill for impairment annually on may 1 at the reporting unit level using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. no impairment of goodwill was identified as of may 1, 2014 or may 2013. our goodwill impairment test as of may 1, 2012, indicated that the carrying value of our previous online services division reporting unit (in devices and consumer other under our current segment structure) exceeded its estimated fair value. accordingly, we recorded a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of $6.2 billion during the three months ended june 30, 2012, reducing the unit's goodwill from $6.4 billion to $223 million.
integration and restructuring integration and restructuring expenses consist of transaction fees and direct acquisition costs, including legal, finance, consulting, and other professional fees. integration and restructuring expenses also include employee compensation and termination costs associated with certain reorganization activities.
integration and restructuring expenses were $127 million for fiscal year 2014, reflecting expenses associated with the acquisition and integration of nds.

we use derivative instruments to: manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; enhance investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification. gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense). other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income ("oci") until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income ("aoci") into other income (expense).
fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013
dividends and interest income increased due to higher portfolio balances. interest expense increased due to higher outstanding long-term debt. net recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to higher gains on sales of equity securities and lower other-than-temporary impairments. other-than-temporary impairments were $106 million in fiscal year 2014, compared with $208 million in fiscal year 2013. net losses on derivatives increased due to higher losses on foreign exchange contracts, losses on equity derivatives as compared to gains in the prior period, offset in part by gains on commodity and interest rate derivatives as compared to losses in the prior period. for fiscal year 2014, other reflects recognized losses from certain joint ventures, offset in part by a recognized gain on a divestiture. for fiscal year 2013, other reflects recognized gains on divestitures, including the gain recognized upon the divestiture of our 50% share in the msnbc joint venture.
part ii item 7
fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012
dividends and interest income decreased due to lower yields on our fixed-income investments, offset in part by higher average portfolio investment balances. net recognized gains on investments decreased primarily due to lower gains on sales of equity and fixed-income securities and a gain recognized on the partial sale of our facebook holding in the prior year, offset in part by lower other-than-temporary impairments. other-than-temporary impairments were $208 million in fiscal year 2013, compared with $298 million in fiscal year 2012. net losses on derivatives decreased due to gains on equity derivatives in the current fiscal year as compared with losses in the prior fiscal year, and lower losses on commodity and foreign exchange derivatives as compared to the prior fiscal year, offset in part by losses on interest-rate derivatives in the current fiscal year as compared to gains in the prior fiscal year. for the current year, other reflects recognized gains on divestitures, including the gain recognized upon the divestiture of our 50% share in the msnbc joint venture.
income taxes fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013
our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2014 and 2013 was approximately 21% and 19%, respectively. our effective tax rate was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico.
our fiscal year 2014 effective rate increased by 2% from fiscal year 2013 mainly due to adjustments of $458 million to prior years' liabilities for intercompany transfer pricing that increased taxable income in more highly taxed jurisdictions, as well as losses incurred by nds and changes in the geographic mix of our business. this was offset in part by favorable transfer pricing developments in certain foreign tax jurisdictions, primarily denmark.
changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries also impacted our effective tax rates and resulted primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our products and services. we supply our windows pc operating system to customers through our u.s. regional operating center, while we supply the microsoft office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. windows pc operating system revenue decreased $655 million in fiscal year 2014, while microsoft office system and server products and tools revenue increased $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, during this same period. in fiscal years 2014 and 2013, our u.s. income before income taxes was $7.1 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively, and comprised 26% and 25%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. in fiscal years 2014 and 2013, the foreign income before income taxes was $20.7 billion and $20.4 billion, respectively, and comprised 74% and 75%, respectively, of our income before income taxes.
tax contingencies and other tax liabilities were $10.4 billion and $9.4 billion as of june 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. this increase relates primarily to adjustments to prior years' liabilities for intercompany transfer pricing and adjustments related to our irs audits. while we settled a portion of the i.r.s. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for those years. in february 2012, the i.r.s. withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. as of june 30, 2014, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. we have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues. we also continue to be subject to examination by the i.r.s. for tax years 2007 to 2013.
we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s. our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2013, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. the resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.
part ii item 7
fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012
our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2013 and 2012 was approximately 19% and 24%, respectively. our effective tax rate was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and puerto rico.
our fiscal year 2013 effective rate decreased by 5% from fiscal year 2012 mainly due to a nonrecurring $6.2 billion non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge that was recorded in fiscal year 2012. the goodwill impairment charge increased our effective tax rate by 10% in fiscal year 2012. in addition, in fiscal years 2013 and 2012, we recognized a reduction of 18% and 21%, respectively, to the effective tax rate due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates. the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2013 was primarily offset by a 1% increase related to the eu fine, which is not tax deductible.
changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the u.s. and foreign countries also impacted our effective tax rates and resulted primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our products and services. we supply our windows pc operating system to customers through our u.s. regional operating center, while we supply the microsoft office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. windows pc operating system revenue increased $209 million in fiscal year 2013, while microsoft office system and server products and tools revenue increased $696 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, during this same period. in fiscal years 2013 and 2012, our u.s. income before income taxes was $6.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, and comprised 25% and 7%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. in fiscal years 2013 and 2012, the foreign income before income taxes was $20.4 billion and $20.7 billion, respectively, and comprised 75% and 93%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. the primary driver for the increase in the u.s. income before income tax in fiscal year 2013 was the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the prior year.
tax contingencies and other tax liabilities were $9.4 billion and $7.6 billion as of june 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. this increase relates primarily to transfer pricing, including transfer pricing developments in certain foreign tax jurisdictions, primarily denmark. while we settled a portion of the i.r.s. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for those years. in february 2012, the i.r.s. withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. as of june 30, 2013, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. we do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months because we do not believe the remaining open issues will be resolved within the next 12 months. we also continue to be subject to examination by the i.r.s. for tax years 2007 to 2012.
we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the u.s. our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2012, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. the resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.
financial condition cash, cash equivalents, and investments cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $85.7 billion as of june 30, 2014, compared with $77.0 billion as of june 30, 2013. equity and other investments were $14.6 billion as of june 30, 2014, compared with $10.8 billion as of june 30, 2013. our short-term investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. they consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. the investments are predominantly u.s. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. the credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are part ii item 7
managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. the settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.
of the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at june 30, 2014, $77.1 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects. the amount of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was $2.6 billion. as of june 30, 2014, approximately 84% of the cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in u.s. government and agency securities, approximately 5% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of u.s. companies, and approximately 1% were invested in u.s. mortgage-backed securities, all of which are denominated in u.s. dollars.
securities lending we lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. our securities lending payable balance was $558 million as of june 30, 2014. our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the fiscal year were $619 million and $1.3 billion, respectively. intra-year variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities.
valuation in general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and u.s. government securities. if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, common and preferred stock, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and certificates of deposit. level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.
a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. our broker-priced investments are generally classified as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. in addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. these controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.
cash flows fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013
cash flows from operations increased $3.4 billion during the current fiscal year to $32.2 billion, due mainly to increases in cash received from customers. cash used in financing increased $246 million to $8.4 billion, due mainly to a $2.0 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases, a $1.4 billion increase in dividends paid, and a $324 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock, offset in part by a $3.4 billion increase in part ii item 7
proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments. cash used in investing decreased $5.0 billion to $18.8 billion, due mainly to a $10.5 billion decrease in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, offset in part by a $4.4 billion increase in cash used for acquisition of companies and purchases of intangible and other assets, and a $1.2 billion increase in capital expenditures for property and equipment.
fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012
cash flows from operations decreased $2.8 billion during the current fiscal year to $28.8 billion, due mainly to changes in working capital, including increases in inventory and other current assets. cash used for financing decreased $1.3 billion to $8.1 billion, due mainly to a $3.5 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments, offset in part by a $1.1 billion increase in dividends paid and a $982 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock. cash used in investing decreased $975 million to $23.8 billion, due mainly to an $8.5 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies and purchases of intangible and other assets, offset in part by a $5.8 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases, maturities, and sales, and a $2.0 billion increase in cash used for additions to property and equipment.
debt we issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. the proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt.
short-term debt as of june 30, 2014, we had $2.0 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.12% and maturities ranging from 86 days to 91 days. the estimated fair value of this commercial paper approximates its carrying value.
we have a $5.0 billion credit facility that expires on november 14, 2018, which serves as a back-up for our commercial paper program. as of june 30, 2014, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in the credit agreement, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense, as defined in the credit agreement. no amounts were drawn against the credit facility during any of the periods presented.
long-term debt as of june 30, 2014, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt were $20.6 billion and $21.5 billion, respectively. these estimated fair values are based on level 2 inputs.

the notes in this table are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other senior unsecured debt outstanding. interest on these notes is paid semi-annually, except for the euro-denominated debt securities on which interest is paid annually. as of june 30, 2014, the aggregate unamortized discount for our long-term debt was $100 million.
unearned revenue unearned revenue at june 30, 2014 was comprised mainly of unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. unearned revenue at june 30, 2014 also included payments for: post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; xbox live subscriptions and prepaid points; microsoft dynamics business solutions products; office 365 subscriptions; bundled offerings; skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.

the following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of june 30, 2014:
share repurchases on september 16, 2013, our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases. the share repurchase program became effective on october 1, 2013, has no expiration date, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. as of june 30, 2014, $35.1 billion remained of the $40.0 billion share repurchase program.
during fiscal year 2014, we repurchased 175 million shares of microsoft common stock for $6.4 billion; 128 million shares were repurchased for $4.9 billion under the share repurchase program approved by our board of directors on september 16, 2013 and 47 million shares were repurchased for $1.5 billion under the share repurchase program that was announced on september 22, 2008 and expired september 30, 2013. during fiscal years 2013 and 2012, we repurchased 158 million shares for $4.6 billion and 142 million shares for $4.0 billion, respectively, under the share repurchase program announced on september 22, 2008. all repurchases were made using cash resources.
off-balance sheet arrangements we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. in evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. these obligations did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.

contractual obligations the following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of june 30, 2014:
construction commitments (b)                   880              0              0               0            880

other long-term liabilities (e)                  0            354             80             393            827
(a)   see note 12  debt of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k).
(b)   these amounts represent commitments for the construction of buildings, building improvements, and leasehold improvements.
(c)   these amounts represent undiscounted future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable facilities leases.
(d)   these amounts represent purchase commitments, including all open purchase orders and all contracts that are take-or-pay contracts that are not presented as construction commitments above.
(e)   we have excluded long-term tax contingencies, other tax liabilities, and deferred income taxes of $13.3 billion from the amounts presented. we have also excluded unearned revenue and non-cash items.
other planned uses of capital we will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. we expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years in support of our cloud and devices strategy. we have operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.
liquidity we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the u.s., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. as a result, as discussed above under cash, cash equivalents, and investments, the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. we currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. we expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. in addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
should we require more capital in the u.s. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, such as business acquisitions and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the u.s. through debt or equity issuances. these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or dilution of our earnings. we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates.

recent accounting guidance recently adopted accounting guidance in december 2011, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity's right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments. the new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed, and the related net exposure. in january 2013, the fasb clarified that the scope of this guidance applies to derivatives, repurchase agreements, and securities lending arrangements that are either offset or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement, or similar agreements. we adopted this new guidance beginning july 1, 2013. adoption of this new guidance resulted only in changes to the presentation of note 5  derivatives of the notes to financial statements.
in february 2013, the fasb issued guidance on disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of aoci. this new guidance requires entities to present (either on the face of the income statement or in the notes to financial statements) the effects on the line items of the income statement for amounts reclassified out of aoci. we adopted this new guidance beginning july 1, 2013. adoption of this new guidance resulted only in changes to the presentation of note 19  accumulated other comprehensive income of the notes to financial statements.
recent accounting guidance not yet adopted in march 2013, the fasb issued guidance on a parent's accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity. this new guidance requires that the parent release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided. the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july 1, 2014. we do not anticipate material impacts on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
in may 2014, as part of its ongoing efforts to assist in the convergence of u.s. gaap and international financial reporting standards, the fasb issued a new standard related to revenue recognition. under the new standard, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. in addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. the new standard will be effective for us beginning july 1, 2017 and early adoption is not permitted. we anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, and we are currently evaluating its impact.
application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. these estimates and assumptions are affected by management's application of accounting policies. critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.
revenue recognition revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.
judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for part ii item 7
current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products ("software assurance") and are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period.
software updates are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered. if it is determined that implied post-contract customer support ("pcs") is being provided, revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied pcs term. if updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available.
microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. where elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under u.s. gaap, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. we use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value ("vsoe"), (ii) third-party evidence, and (iii) best estimate of selling price ("esp"). for software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of vsoe in establishing fair value. generally, vsoe is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. esps are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. our process for determining esps requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable.
windows 7 revenue was subject to deferral as a result of the windows upgrade offer, which started june 2, 2012. the offer provided significantly discounted rights to purchase windows 8 pro to qualifying end-users that purchased windows 7 pcs during the eligibility period. microsoft was responsible for delivering windows 8 pro to the end customer. accordingly, revenue related to the allocated discount for undelivered windows 8 was deferred until it was delivered or the redemption period expired.
impairment of investment securities we review investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. this determination requires significant judgment. in making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. for fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. if market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
goodwill we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (may 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
part ii item 7
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. this analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.
the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.
the valuation of acquired assets and liabilities, including goodwill, resulting from the acquisition of nds, is reflective of the enterprise value based on the long-term financial forecast for the business. in this highly competitive and volatile market, it is possible that we may not realize our forecasts. given the value assigned to goodwill in the purchase price allocation, we will closely monitor the performance of the business versus the long-term forecast to determine if any impairments arise.
research and development costs costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.
legal and other contingencies the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
inventories inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. we regularly review inventory part ii item 7
quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. these reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. the determination of market value and the estimated volume of demand used in the lower of cost or market analysis require significant judgment.
part ii item 7
statement of management's responsibility for financial statements management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. the consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management's estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.

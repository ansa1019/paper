our business general the coca-cola company is a total beverage company, and beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the united states since 1886, are now sold in more than 200 countries and territories. we own or license and market numerous nonalcoholic beverage brands, which we group into the following category clusters: sparkling soft drinks; water, enhanced water and sports drinks; juice, dairy and plant-based beverages; tea and coffee; and energy drinks. we own and market four of the world's top five nonalcoholic sparkling soft drink brands: coca-cola, diet coke, fanta and sprite.
we make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers as well as the company's consolidated bottling and distribution operations - the world's largest nonalcoholic beverage distribution system. beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for 1.9 billion of the approximately 62 billion servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day.
we believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of beverage options to meet their desires, needs and lifestyles. our success further depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day.
our company markets, manufactures and sells:
•beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as "beverage bases," and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our "concentrate business" or "concentrate operations"); and
•finished sparkling soft drinks and other nonalcoholic beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our "finished product business" or "finished product operations").
generally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.
our concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates, syrups and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which we typically refer as our "bottlers" or our "bottling partners"). our bottling partners either combine concentrates with sweeteners (depending on the product), still water or sparkling water, or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. the finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through wholesalers or other bottlers. in addition, outside the united states, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrate, which they sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our global ventures operating segment.
our finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished nonalcoholic beverages, such as water, enhanced water and sports drinks; juice, dairy and plant-based beverages; tea and coffee; and energy drinks, to retailers, or to distributors and wholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. these operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our bottling investments operating segment. in certain markets, the company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to distributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the company's bottling partners. these operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments or our global ventures operating segment. additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail outlets operated by costa, which is included in our global ventures operating segment. in the united states, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. these fountain syrup sales are included in our north america operating segment.
the following table sets forth the percentage of total net operating revenues attributable to concentrate operations and finished product operations:

the nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry we operate in the highly competitive nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry. we face strong competition from numerous other general and specialty beverage companies. we, along with other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending, economic conditions, availability and quality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, political climate, local and national laws and regulations, foreign currency fluctuations, fuel prices and weather patterns.
emerging stronger from the covid-19 pandemic throughout 2020, the effects of the covid-19 pandemic and the related actions by governments around the world to attempt to contain the spread of the virus have significantly impacted our business. in particular, the outbreak and preventive measures taken to contain covid-19 negatively impacted our unit case volume and our price, product and geographic mix in all of our operating segments, primarily due to unfavorable channel and product mix as consumer demand shifted to more at-home versus away-from-home consumption.
the company's priorities during the covid-19 pandemic and related business disruption are ensuring the health and safety of our employees; supporting and making a difference in the communities we serve; keeping our brands in supply and maintaining the quality and safety of our products; serving our customers across all channels as they adapt to the shifting demands of consumers during the crisis; and positioning ourselves to emerge stronger when this crisis ends.
we deployed global and regional teams to monitor the rapidly evolving situation in each of our local markets and recommended risk mitigation actions; we implemented travel restrictions; and we are following social distancing practices. around the world, we are endeavoring to follow guidance from authorities and health officials including, but not limited to, checking the temperature of associates when entering our facilities, requiring associates to wear masks and other protective clothing as appropriate, and implementing additional cleaning and sanitization routines at system facilities. in addition, most office-based employees around the world are required to work remotely.
during times of crisis, business continuity and adapting to the needs of our customers are critical. we have developed systemwide knowledge-sharing routines and processes, which include the management of any supply chain challenges. as of the date of this filing, there has been no material impact, and we do not foresee a material impact, on our and our bottling partners' ability to manufacture or distribute our products. we are moving with speed to best serve our customers impacted by covid-19. in partnership with our bottlers and retail customers, we are working to ensure adequate inventory levels in key channels while prioritizing core brands, key packages and consumer affordability. we are increasing investments in e-commerce to support retailer and meal delivery services, shifting toward package sizes that are fit-for-purpose for online sales, and shifting more consumer and trade promotions to digital.
although we are experiencing a time of crisis, we are not losing sight of long-term opportunities for our business. the pandemic helped us realize we could be much bolder in our efforts to change. we believe that we will come out of this situation a better and stronger company. we identified the following key objectives to navigate the pandemic and position us to emerge stronger: winning more consumers; gaining market share; maintaining strong system economics; strengthening stakeholder impact; and equipping the organization to win. we leveraged the crisis as a catalyst to accelerate our strategy and to begin to deliver against these objectives by focusing on the following priorities: optimizing our portfolio of strong global, regional and scaled local brands; establishing a disciplined innovation framework; increasing consumer-centric marketing effectiveness and efficiency; strengthening data-driven revenue growth management and execution capabilities; enhancing system collaboration and capturing supply chain efficiencies; and evolving our organization and investing in new capabilities to support the accelerated strategy. in august 2020, the company announced strategic steps to transform our organizational structure to better enable us to capture growth in the fast-changing marketplace. the company is building a networked global organization designed to combine the power of scale with the deep knowledge required to win locally. refer to note 18 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about our strategic realignment initiatives.
core capabilities to support our ability to emerge stronger from the covid-19 pandemic, we must continue to enhance our core capabilities of consumer marketing, commercial leadership and franchise leadership.
consumer marketing marketing investments are designed to enhance consumer awareness of, and increase consumer preference for, our brands. successful marketing investments produce long-term growth in unit case volume, per capita consumption and our share of worldwide nonalcoholic beverage sales. through our relationships with our bottling partners and those who sell our products in the marketplace, we create and implement integrated marketing programs, both globally and locally, that are designed to heighten consumer awareness of and product appeal for our brands. in developing a strategy for a company brand, we conduct product and packaging research, establish brand positioning, develop precise consumer communications and solicit consumer feedback. our integrated marketing activities include, but are not limited to, advertising, point-of-sale merchandising, sales promotions and digital marketing.
we are focusing on marketing strategies to drive volume growth in emerging markets, increase our brand value in developing markets, and grow net operating revenues and profit in our developed markets. in emerging markets, we are investing in infrastructure programs that drive volume through increased access to consumers. in developing markets, where consumer access has largely been established, our focus is on differentiating our brands. in our developed markets, we continue to invest in brands and infrastructure programs but generally at a slower rate than gross profit growth.
commercial leadership the coca-cola system has millions of customers around the world who sell or serve our products directly to consumers. we focus on enhancing value for our customers and providing solutions to grow their beverage businesses. our approach includes understanding each customer's business and needs - whether that customer is a sophisticated retailer in a developed market or a kiosk owner in an emerging market. we focus on ensuring that our customers have the right product and package offerings and the right promotional tools to create enhanced value for themselves and the company. we are constantly looking to build new beverage consumption occasions in our customers' outlets through unique and innovative consumer experiences, product availability and delivery systems, and beverage merchandising and displays. we participate in brand-building initiatives with our customers in order to drive consumer preference for our brands. through our commercial leadership initiatives, we embed ourselves further into our retail customers' businesses while developing strategies for better execution at the point of sale.
franchise leadership we must continue to improve our franchise leadership capabilities to give our company and our bottling partners the ability to grow together through shared values, aligned incentives and a sense of urgency and flexibility that supports consumers' always changing needs and tastes. the financial health and success of our bottling partners are critical components of the company's success. we work with our bottling partners to identify processes that enable us to quickly achieve scale and efficiencies, and we share best practices throughout the bottling system. with our bottling partners, we work to produce differentiated beverages and packages that are appropriate for the right channels and consumers. we also design business models in specific markets to ensure that we appropriately share the value created by our beverages with our bottling partners. we must also continue to build a supply chain network that leverages the size and scale of the coca-cola system to gain a competitive advantage.
challenges and risks being global provides unique opportunities for our company. challenges and risks accompany those opportunities. our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry and our company. of these, five key challenges and risks are discussed below.
obesity the rates of obesity affecting communities, cultures and countries worldwide continue to be too high. there is growing concern among consumers, public health professionals and government agencies about the health problems associated with obesity. this concern represents a significant challenge to our industry. we understand and recognize that obesity is a complex public health challenge and are committed to being a part of the solution.
we recognize the uniqueness of consumers' lifestyles and dietary choices. commercially, we continue to:
•offer reduced-, low- and no-calorie beverage options;
•provide transparent nutrition information, featuring calories on the front of most of our packages;
•market responsibly, including no advertising targeted to children under 12.
the heritage of our company is to lead, and innovation is critical for leadership. as such, we are resolute in continuing to innovate and are committed to partnering to find winning solutions in the area of noncaloric sweeteners. this includes working to reduce sugar and calories in many of our beverages. we want to be a more helpful and credible partner in the fight against obesity. across the coca-cola system, we are mobilizing our assets in marketing and in community outreach to increase awareness and spur action.
evolving consumer product and shopping preferences we are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs, on-the-go lifestyles and consumers who are empowered with more information than ever. as a consequence of these changes, many consumers want more choices, personalization, a focus on sustainability and recyclability, and transparency related to our products and packaging. we are committed to meeting their needs and to generating new growth through our evolving portfolio of beverage brands and products (including numerous low- and no-calorie products), new product offerings, innovative and sustainable packaging, and ingredient education efforts. we are also committed to continuing to expand the variety of choices we provide to consumers and to providing options that reflect consumer concerns about impacts to the planet.
increased competition and capabilities in the marketplace our company faces strong competition from well-established global companies as well as numerous regional and local companies. additionally, the rapidly evolving digital landscape and growth of e-commerce has led to dramatic shifts in consumer shopping patterns and presents new challenges to competitively maintain the relevancy of our brands. we must continuously strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation in order to compete in a digital environment and maintain our brand loyalty and market share, while we selectively expand into other profitable categories of the nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry.
product safety and quality we strive to meet the highest standards in both product safety and product quality. we are aware that some consumers have concerns and negative viewpoints regarding certain ingredients used in our products. the coca-cola system works every day to share safe and refreshing beverages with consumers around the world. we have rigorous product and ingredient safety and quality standards designed to ensure safety and quality in each of our products, and we drive innovation that provides new beverage options to meet consumers' evolving needs and preferences.
we work to ensure consistent safety and quality through strong governance and compliance with applicable regulations and standards. we stay current with new regulations, industry best practices and marketplace conditions, and we engage with standard-setting and industry organizations. additionally, we manufacture and distribute our products according to strict policies, requirements and specifications set forth in an integrated quality management program that continually measures all operations within the coca-cola system against the same stringent standards. our quality management system also identifies and mitigates risks and drives improvement. in our quality laboratories, we stringently measure the quality attributes of ingredients as well as samples of finished products collected from the marketplace.
we perform due diligence to ensure that product and ingredient safety and quality standards are maintained in the more than 200 countries and territories where our products are sold. we regularly assess the relevance of our requirements and standards and continually work to improve and refine them across our entire supply chain.
ingredient quality and quantity water quality and quantity is an issue that requires our company's sustained attention and collaboration with other companies, suppliers, governments, nongovernmental organizations and communities where we operate. water is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products, is vital to the production of the agricultural ingredients on which our business relies, and is needed in our manufacturing process. it also is critical to the prosperity of the communities we serve. water is a critical natural resource facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation, increased food demand, increasing pollution, poor management and the effects of climate change.
our company regularly assesses the specific water-related risks that we and many of our bottling partners face and has implemented a formal water risk management program. mitigation of water risk forms the basis of our water stewardship strategic framework. this strategy is executed at the local level where we operate and includes the following elements: water use efficiency and wastewater treatment in manufacturing operations; shared watershed protection efforts; engaging local communities; and addressing water resource management in our agricultural ingredient supply chain. such efforts are conducted in collaboration and partnership with others and are intended to help address local needs. many of these efforts help us in achieving our goal of replenishing the water that we and our bottling partners source and use in our finished products. we are also collaborating with other companies, governments, nongovernmental organizations and communities to advocate for needed water policy reforms and action to protect water availability and quality around the world.
we believe that our company can leverage the water-related knowledge we have developed in the communities we serve through source water availability assessments and planning, water resource management, water treatment, wastewater treatment systems and models for working with communities and partners in addressing water and sanitation needs. as demand for water continues to increase around the world, we expect continued action on our part will help with the successful long-term stewardship of this critical natural resource, both for our business and the communities we serve.
in addition, increased demand for commodities and decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns may limit the availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as sugarcane, corn, sugar beets, citrus, coffee and tea, which are important sources of ingredients for our products, and could impact the food security of communities around the world. we are dedicated to implementing our sustainable sourcing commitment, which is founded on principles that protect the environment, uphold workplace rights and help build more sustainable communities. to support this commitment, our programs focus on economic opportunity, with an emphasis on female farmers, and environmental sustainability designed to help address these agricultural challenges. through joint efforts with farmers, communities, bottlers, suppliers and key partners, as well as our increased and continued investment in sustainable agriculture, we can together help make a positive strategic impact on food security.
all of these challenges and risks - obesity; evolving consumer preferences; increased competition and capabilities in the marketplace; product safety and quality; and ingredient quality and quantity - have the potential to have a material adverse effect on the nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry and on our company; however, we believe our company is well positioned to appropriately address these challenges and risks.
see ''item 1a. risk factors'' in part i of this report for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our company.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("u.s. gaap"), which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. we believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following:
•principles of consolidation
•recoverability of current and noncurrent assets
•revenue recognition
•income taxes management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the company's board of directors. while our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. for a discussion of the company's significant accounting policies, refer to note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
principles of consolidation our company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. additionally, there are situations in which consolidation is required even though the usual condition of consolidation (ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business enterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entity's voting interests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. this disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest, and the entity in which we have the variable interest is referred to as a "vie." an enterprise must consolidate a vie if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie. the primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie.
our company holds interests in certain vies, primarily bottling operations, for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary. our variable interests in these vies primarily relate to equity investments, profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. refer to note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements. although these financial arrangements resulted in our holding variable interests in these entities, they did not empower us to direct the activities of the vies that most significantly impact the vies' economic performance. creditors of our vies do not have recourse against the general credit of the company, regardless of whether they are accounted for as consolidated entities.
we use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. our consolidated net income includes our company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investee includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intercompany transactions.
we eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with consolidated vies and the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees.
recoverability of current and noncurrent assets our company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the countries in which we operate, particularly in developing and emerging markets. refer to the heading "our business - challenges and risks" above and "item 1a. risk factors" in part i of this report. as a result, management must make numerous assumptions which involve a significant amount of judgment when completing recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets in various regions around the world.
we perform recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets in accordance with u.s. gaap. for certain assets, recoverability and/or impairment tests are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. for other assets, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired.
the assessment of recoverability and the performance of impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets involve critical accounting estimates. these estimates require significant management judgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. factors that management must estimate include, among others, the economic lives of the assets, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, inflation, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending, proceeds from the sale of assets and customers' financial condition. these factors are even more difficult to estimate as a result of uncertainties associated with the scope, severity and duration of the global covid-19 pandemic and any resurgences of the pandemic including, but not limited to, the number of people contracting the virus, the impact of shelter-in-place and social distancing requirements, the impact of governmental actions across the globe to contain the virus, the timing and number of people receiving vaccinations, and the substance and pace of the post-pandemic economic recovery. the estimates we use when assessing the recoverability of assets are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. when performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using management's best assumptions, which we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. the variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainties associated with the covid-19 pandemic, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. our current estimates reflect our belief that we expect covid-19 to impact our business for the better part of 2021, with the first half of the year likely to be more challenging than the second half. we expect to see improvements in our business as vaccines become more widely available throughout the year and consumers begin to return to many of their previous routines of socializing, work and travel. the company has certain intangible and other long-lived assets that are more dependent on cash flows generated in the away-from-home channels and/or that generate cash flows in geographic areas that are more heavily impacted by the covid-19 pandemic and are therefore more susceptible to impairment. in addition, intangible and other long-lived assets we acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, because they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions at the time of acquisition. if we had used other assumptions and estimates when tests of these assets were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. furthermore, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions exist in future periods, future impairment charges could result. the total future impairment charges we may be required to record could be material. refer to note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent acquisitions. refer to note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements for the discussion of impairment charges. refer to the heading "operations review" below for additional information related to our present business environment. certain factors discussed above are impacted by our current business environment and are discussed throughout this report, as appropriate.
investments in equity and debt securities we measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. we use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of equity securities with readily determinable fair values. for equity securities without readily determinable fair values, we have elected the measurement alternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. management assesses each of these investments on an individual basis.
our investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. the cost basis is determined by the specific identification method. investments in debt securities that the company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are included in net income. unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale debt securities are included in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("aoci"), except for the changes in fair values attributable to the currency risk being hedged, if applicable, which are included in net income.
equity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method and debt securities classified as trading are not assessed for impairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. equity method investments, equity securities without readily determinable fair values and debt securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity are reviewed each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. when such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment. we also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value. the fair values of most of our company's investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. for investments in nonpublicly traded companies, management's assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds and appraisals, as appropriate. we consider the assumptions that we believe market participants would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. the ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the determination of fair value. in the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. if management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
property, plant and equipment certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount or remaining useful life of property, plant and equipment should be assessed, including, among others, the manner or length of time in which the company intends to use the asset, a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses. when such events or changes in circumstances are present and an impairment test is performed, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. these estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. if the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. we use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment, including appraisals and discounted cash flow models. these appraisals and models include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use.
goodwill, trademarks and other intangible assets intangible assets are classified into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. for intangible assets with definite lives, tests for impairment must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. for intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill, tests for impairment must be performed at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired.
the assessment of recoverability and the performance of impairment tests of intangible assets involve critical accounting estimates. these estimates require significant management judgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. factors that management must estimate include, among others, the economic lives of the assets, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, inflation, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending and proceeds from the sale of assets. these factors are even more difficult to predict when global financial markets are highly volatile. the estimates we use when assessing the recoverability of intangible assets are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. when performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using management's best assumptions, which we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate. the variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. if other assumptions and estimates had been used when these tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. as mentioned above, these factors do not change in isolation and, therefore, we do not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor. furthermore, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions exist in future periods, future impairment charges could result. refer to the heading "operations review" below for additional information related to our present business environment. certain factors discussed above are impacted by our current business environment and are discussed throughout this report, as appropriate.
intangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, because they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition. consequently, if operating results and/or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets. a deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital and/or discount rates. additionally, as discussed above, in accordance with u.s. gaap, we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions that we believe a market participant would use. as a result, the cost of capital and/or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends, regardless of whether our company's actual cost of capital has changed. therefore, if the cost of capital and/or discount rates change, our company may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to, or greater than, our previously forecasted amounts.
we perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments. our operating segments are primarily based on geographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. our geographic operating segments are subdivided into smaller geographic regions or territories that we sometimes refer to as "business units." these business units are also our reporting units. our global ventures operating segment includes the results of our costa, innocent and doğadan businesses as well as fees earned pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the company and monster, each of which is its own reporting unit. the bottling investments operating segment includes all of our consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location. generally, each consolidated bottling operation within our bottling investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination.
in order to test for goodwill impairment, the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. however, the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. we typically use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. the assumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe a market participant would use. the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill rather than completing the impairment test. the company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if the company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the testing discussed above. otherwise, the company does not need to perform any further assessment.
when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. these estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. if the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, we recognize an impairment loss. the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. we use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models. these models include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use.
we test indefinite-lived intangible assets, including trademarks, franchise rights and goodwill, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. our company performs these annual impairment tests as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. we use a variety of methodologies in conducting impairment assessments of indefinite-lived intangible assets, including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models. these models include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. for indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, rather than completing the impairment test. the company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. if the company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the testing described above. otherwise, the company does not need to perform any further assessment.
pension plan valuations our company sponsors and/or contributes to pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans covering substantially all u.s. employees. we also sponsor nonqualified, unfunded defined benefit pension plans for certain employees and participate in multi-employer retirement plans in the united states. in addition, our company and its subsidiaries have various pension plans and other forms of postretirement benefit arrangements outside the united states.
management is required to make certain critical estimates related to the actuarial assumptions used to determine our net periodic pension cost and pension obligations. we believe the most critical assumptions are (1) the discount rate used to determine the present value of the liabilities and (2) the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. all of our actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, or more frequently to the extent that a settlement or curtailment occurs. changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic pension cost and pension obligations.
at each measurement date, we determine the discount rate primarily by reference to rates of high-quality, long-term corporate bonds that mature in a pattern similar to the future benefit payments we anticipate making under the plans.
the company measures the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans' projected cash flows.
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the long-term outlook of our investment strategy as well as our historical returns and volatilities for each asset class. we also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of our long-term rates. our investment objective for our pension plan assets is to ensure all of our plans have sufficient funds to meet their benefit obligations when they become due. as a result, the company periodically revises asset allocations, where appropriate, to seek to improve returns and manage risk.
in 2020, the company's total income related to defined benefit pension plans was $44 million, which included $66 million of net periodic benefit income and net charges of $22 million, primarily due to settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits. in 2021, we expect our net periodic benefit income related to defined benefit pension plans to be approximately $146 million. we currently expect to incur settlement charges in 2021 related to our strategic realignment initiatives. the increase in 2021 expected net periodic benefit income is primarily due to favorable asset performance in 2020 and a reduction in the number of plan participants arising from our strategic realignment initiatives, partially offset by a decrease in the weighted-average discount rate at december 31, 2020 compared to december 31, 2019. the estimated impact of a 50 basis-point decrease in the discount rate would result in a $17 million decrease in our 2021 net periodic benefit income. additionally, the estimated impact of a 50 basis-point decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would result in a $26 million decrease in our 2021 net periodic benefit income.
the sensitivity information provided above is based only on changes to the actuarial assumptions used for our u.s. pension plans. as of december 31, 2020, the company's primary u.s. pension plan represented 61 percent and 59 percent of the company's consolidated projected benefit obligation and pension plan assets, respectively. refer to note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about our pension plans and related actuarial assumptions.
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers are satisfied. our performance obligation generally consists of the promise to sell concentrates, syrups or finished products to our bottling partners, wholesalers, distributors or retailers. control of the concentrates, syrups or finished products is transferred upon shipment to, or receipt at, our customers' locations, as determined by the specific terms of the contract. upon transfer of control to the customer, which completes our performance obligation, revenue is recognized. our sales terms generally do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part. after completion of our performance obligation, we have an unconditional right to consideration as outlined in the contract. our receivables will generally be collected in less than six months, in accordance with the underlying payment terms. all of our performance obligations under the terms of contracts with our customers have an original duration of one year or less.
our customers and bottling partners may be entitled to cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume‐based incentive programs, support for infrastructure programs and other similar programs. in most markets, in an effort to allow our company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model. under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrate are sold, and package mix. the amounts associated with the arrangements described above represent variable consideration, an estimate of which is included in the transaction price as a component of net operating revenues in our consolidated statement of income upon completion of our performance obligations. the total revenue recorded, including any variable consideration, cannot exceed the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur when uncertainties related to variability are resolved. as a result, we are recognizing revenue based on our faithful depiction of the consideration that we expect to receive. in making our estimates of variable consideration, we consider past results and make significant assumptions related to: (1) customer sales volumes; (2) customer ending inventories; (3) customer selling price per unit; (4) selling channels; and (5) discount rates, rebates and other pricing allowances, as applicable. in gathering data to estimate our variable consideration, we generally calculate our estimates using a portfolio approach at the country and product line level rather than at the individual contract level. the result of making these estimates will impact the line items trade accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet. the actual amounts ultimately paid and/or received may be different from our estimates.
income taxes our annual effective tax rate is based on our income and the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. significant judgment is required in determining our annual income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. we establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the position becomes uncertain based upon one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is not "more likely than not" to be sustained; (2) the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained, but for a lesser amount; or (3) the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken. for purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain, (1) we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information; (2) the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings and caselaw and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position; and (3) each tax position is evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken. we adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. refer to the heading "operations review - income taxes" below and note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
a number of years may elapse before a particular uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. the number of years subject to tax audits or tax assessments varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. the tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the "more likely than not" recognition threshold would be recognized in income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained; (2) the tax position, amount, and/or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation; or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. refer to note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
tax law requires certain items to be included in the tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements. as a result, the annual effective tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different from that reported in our tax return (our cash tax rate). some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. the tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year and for the manner in which the differences are expected to reverse. based on the evaluation of all available information, the company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not.
we evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results; the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences; taxable income in prior carryback years (if permitted); and the availability of tax planning strategies. a valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the company will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset.
the company does not record a u.s. deferred tax liability for the excess of the book basis over the tax basis of its investments in foreign subsidiaries to the extent that the basis difference meets the indefinite reversal criteria. these criteria are met if the foreign subsidiary has invested, or will invest, the undistributed earnings indefinitely. the decision as to the amount of undistributed earnings that the company intends to maintain in non-u.s. subsidiaries takes into account items including, but not limited to, forecasts and budgets of financial needs of cash for working capital, liquidity plans, capital improvement programs, merger and acquisition plans, and planned loans to other non-u.s. subsidiaries. the company also evaluates its expected cash requirements in the united states. other factors that can influence that determination are local restrictions on remittances (for example, in some countries a central bank application and approval are required in order for the company's local country subsidiary to pay a dividend), economic stability and asset risk. refer to note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
operations review our organizational structure consists of the following operating segments: europe, middle east and africa; latin america; north america; asia pacific; global ventures; and bottling investments. our operating structure also includes corporate, which consists of two components: (1) a center focused on strategic initiatives, policy and governance; and (2) an enabling services organization focused on both simplifying and standardizing key transactional processes and providing support to business units through global centers of excellence. for further information regarding our operating segments, refer to note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
structural changes, acquired brands and newly licensed brands in order to continually improve upon the company's operating performance, from time to time, we engage in buying and selling ownership interests in bottling partners and other manufacturing operations. in addition, we also acquire brands or enter into license agreements for certain brands to supplement our beverage offerings. these items impact our operating results and certain key metrics used by management in assessing the company's performance.
unit case volume growth is a metric used by management to evaluate the company's performance because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. the company's unit case volume represents the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers and, therefore, reflects unit case volume for both consolidated and unconsolidated bottlers. refer to the heading "beverage volume" below.
concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished products sold by, the company to its bottling partners or other customers. for costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of coffee beans and finished beverages (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by the company to customers or consumers. refer to the heading "beverage volume" below.
when we analyze our net operating revenues we generally consider the following factors: (1) volume growth (concentrate sales volume or unit case volume, as applicable); (2) changes in price, product and geographic mix; (3) foreign currency fluctuations; and (4) acquisitions and divestitures (including structural changes defined below), as applicable. refer to the heading "net operating revenues" below. the company sells concentrates and syrups to both consolidated and unconsolidated bottling partners. the ownership structure of our bottling partners impacts the timing of recognizing concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume. when we sell concentrates or syrups to our consolidated bottling partners, we are not able to recognize the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume until the bottling partner has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party or independent customer. when we sell concentrates or syrups to our unconsolidated bottling partners, we recognize the concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when the concentrates or syrups are sold to the bottling partner. the subsequent sale of the finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party or independent customer does not impact the timing of recognizing the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume. when we account for an unconsolidated bottling partner as an equity method investment, we eliminate the intercompany profit related to these transactions to the extent of our ownership interest until the equity method investee has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party or independent customer. we typically report unit case volume when finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups are sold to a third party or independent customer regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner.
we generally refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling operations as structural changes, which are a component of acquisitions and divestitures. typically, structural changes do not impact the company's unit case volume or concentrate sales volume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. we recognize unit case volume for all sales of company beverage products, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. however, the unit case volume reported by our bottling investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of our consolidated bottling operations. refer to note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company's acquisitions and divestitures.
"acquired brands" refers to brands acquired during the past 12 months. typically, the company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of a transaction. therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to these brands is incremental to prior year volume. we generally do not consider the acquisition of a brand to be a structural change.
"licensed brands" refers to brands not owned by the company, but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and from which we derive an economic benefit when the products are sold. typically, the company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to these brands in periods prior to the beginning of the term of a license agreement. therefore, in the year that a license agreement is entered into, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to the brand is incremental to prior year volume. we generally do not consider the licensing of a brand to be a structural change.
in 2020, the company acquired the remaining ownership interest in fairlife. the impact on revenues for fairlife products not previously sold by the company has been included in acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the north america operating segment.
also in 2020, the company discontinued our odwalla juice business. the impact of discontinuing our odwalla juice business has been included in acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the north america operating segment.
in 2019, the company acquired the remaining ownership interest in c.h.i. limited ("chi"). the impact of this acquisition has been included in acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the europe, middle east and africa operating segment. other acquisitions by the company included controlling interests in bottling operations in zambia, kenya and eswatini. the impact of these acquisitions has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the bottling investments and europe, middle east and africa operating segments.
also in 2019, the company refranchised certain of its bottling operations in india. the impact of these refranchising activities has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the bottling investments and asia pacific operating segments.
beverage volume we measure the volume of company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. as used in this report, "unit case" means a unit of measurement equal to 192 u.s. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, which are primarily measured in number of transactions; and "unit case volume" means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers. unit case volume primarily consists of beverage products bearing company trademarks. also included in unit case volume are certain products licensed to, or distributed by, our company, and brands owned by coca-cola system bottlers for which our company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive economic benefit. in addition, unit case volume includes sales by certain joint ventures in which the company has an ownership interest. we believe unit case volume is one of the measures of the underlying strength of the coca-cola system because it measures trends at the consumer level. the unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the company from its bottling partners and distributors. concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the company to its bottling partners or other customers. for costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of coffee beans and finished beverages (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by the company to customers or consumers. unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. factors such as seasonality, bottlers' inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. in addition to these items, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the company has an ownership interest, but to which the company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals, may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates.
information about our volume growth worldwide and by operating segment is as follows:
percent change 2020 versus 2019
unit cases               1,2       concentrate sales worldwide                                    (6)     %                 3             (7)       %
bottling investments                        (15)                                             n/a bottling investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only.
geographic and global ventures operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for all bottlers, both consolidated and unconsolidated, and distributors in the applicable geographic areas. global ventures operating segment data also reflects unit case volume growth for costa retail stores.
in 2019, with the exception of ready-to-drink products, the company did not report unit case volume for costa, a component of the global ventures operating segment. however, unit case volume in 2020 includes both costa ready-to-drink and non-ready-to-drink products. the company adjusted 2019 to include costa non-ready-to-drink unit case volume when calculating 2020 versus 2019 volume growth rates.
after considering the impact of structural changes, unit case volume for bottling investments for the year ended december 31, 2020 declined 13 percent.
after considering the impact of structural changes, concentrate sales volume for asia pacific for the year ended december 31, 2020 declined 10 percent.
unit case volume sparkling soft drinks represented 69 percent of our worldwide unit case volume in 2020 and 2019. trademark coca‐cola accounted for 47 percent and 45 percent of our worldwide unit case volume in 2020 and 2019, respectively. in 2020, unit case volume in the united states represented 18 percent of the company's worldwide unit case volume. of the u.s. unit case volume, 61 percent was attributable to sparkling soft drinks. trademark coca-cola accounted for 43 percent of u.s. unit case volume. unit case volume outside the united states represented 82 percent of the company's worldwide unit case volume for 2020. the countries outside the united states in which our unit case volumes were the largest were mexico, china, brazil and japan, which together accounted for 32 percent of our worldwide unit case volume. of the non-u.s. unit case volume,
71 percent was attributable to sparkling soft drinks. trademark coca-cola accounted for 48 percent of non-u.s. unit case volume.
the coca-cola system sold 29.0 billion and 30.3 billion unit cases of our products in 2020 and 2019, respectively. the decline was primarily due to the covid-19 pandemic.
unit case volume in europe, middle east and africa declined 6 percent, which included a 4 percent decline in sparkling soft drinks, an 18 percent decline in both water, enhanced water and sports drinks and tea and coffee, and a 9 percent decline in juice, dairy and plant-based beverages. the group's sparkling soft drinks volume performance reflected a decline of 2 percent in trademark coca-cola. the group reported declines in unit case volume in all business units with the exception of the west africa business unit, which reported a 3 percent increase in unit case volume.
in latin america, unit case volume declined 2 percent, which included a 1 percent decline in sparkling soft drinks, a 4 percent decline in water, enhanced water and sports drinks, a 6 percent decline in juice, dairy and plant-based beverages and a 1 percent decline in tea and coffee. trademark coca-cola grew 1 percent. the group reported declines in unit case volume of 4 percent in the mexico business unit and 6 percent in the south latin business unit, which were partially offset by a 3 percent increase in unit case volume in the brazil business unit and even volume in the latin center business unit.
unit case volume in north america declined 7 percent, which included a 15 percent decline in tea and coffee and a 4 percent decline in both water, enhanced water and sports drinks and juice, dairy and plant-based beverages. the group's sparkling soft drinks volume declined 7 percent, which included a 5 percent decline in trademark coca-cola.
in asia pacific, unit case volume declined 9 percent, which included a 16 percent decline in both water, enhanced water and sports drinks and juice, dairy and plant-based beverages, a 5 percent decline in sparkling soft drinks and an 8 percent decline in tea and coffee. the group's sparkling soft drinks volume performance included growth of 2 percent in trademark coca-cola. the group reported declines in unit case volume of 27 percent in the india & south west asia business unit, 7 percent in both the asean and japan business units, 4 percent in the south pacific business unit and 3 percent in the greater china & korea business unit.
unit case volume for global ventures declined 13 percent, driven by a 29 percent decrease in tea and coffee, partially offset by growth in energy drinks. performance was even in juice, dairy and plant-based beverages.
unit case volume for bottling investments declined 15 percent.
through early february 2021, the company has experienced a volume decline of mid single digits globally.
concentrate sales volume in 2020, worldwide concentrate sales volume declined 7 percent and unit case volume declined 6 percent compared to 2019. the differences between concentrate sales volume and unit case volume growth rates on a consolidated basis and for the operating segments were primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments, structural changes and the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the company has an ownership interest, but to which the company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals.
the following table illustrates, on a percentage basis, the estimated impact of the factors resulting in the increase (decrease) in net operating revenues on a consolidated basis and for each of our operating segments:
percent change 2020 versus 2019
volume       price, product &amp; geographic mix       foreign currency fluctuations        acquisitions &amp; divestitures          total consolidated                               (7)    %                         (2)             %                     (2)           %                         -   %               (11)    %
bottling investments                      (13)                                2                                   (4)                                   (2)                   (16)
represents the percent change in net operating revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for our geographic operating segments and our global ventures operating segment (expressed in equivalent unit cases) after considering the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. for our bottling investments operating segment, this represents the percent change in net operating revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume after considering the impact of structural changes. our bottling investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only. refer to the heading "beverage volume" above.
includes structural changes. refer to the heading "structural changes, acquired brands and newly licensed brands" above.
refer to the heading "beverage volume" above for additional information related to changes in our unit case and concentrate sales volumes.
"price, product and geographic mix" refers to the change in net operating revenues caused by factors such as price changes, the mix of products and packages sold, and the mix of channels and geographic territories where the sales occurred. the impact of price, product and geographic mix is calculated by subtracting the change in net operating revenues resulting from volume increases or decreases, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures from the total change in net operating revenues. management believes that providing investors with price, product and geographic mix enhances their understanding about the combined impact that the following items had on the company's net operating revenues: (1) pricing actions taken by the company and, where applicable, our bottling partners; (2) the change in the mix of products and packages sold; (3) the change in the mix of channels where products were sold; and (4) the change in the mix of geographic territories where products were sold. management uses this measure in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the company's performance.
price, product and geographic mix had a 2 percent unfavorable impact on our consolidated net operating revenues. price, product and geographic mix was impacted by a variety of factors and events including, but not limited to, the following:
•latin america - favorable pricing initiatives in mexico and the impact of inflationary environments in certain markets, partially offset by unfavorable channel and package mix;
•asia pacific - unfavorable channel and package mix across a majority of the business units, partially offset by favorable geographic mix;
•bottling investments - favorable pricing and geographic mix, partially offset by unfavorable channel and package mix.
the unfavorable channel and package mix for the year ended december 31, 2020 in all operating segments was primarily a result of the shift in consumer demand due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. consumers were purchasing more products in the at-home channels and fewer in the away-from-home channels. we expect any shift in consumer demand back to the away-from-home channels to be closely correlated with the timing and availability of covid-19 vaccines and consumers returning to many of their previous routines of socializing, work and travel.
foreign currency fluctuations decreased our consolidated net operating revenues by 2 percent. this unfavorable impact was primarily due to a stronger u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, including the mexican peso, brazilian real, south african rand, turkish lira and indian rupee, which had an unfavorable impact on our latin america, europe, middle east and africa, asia pacific and bottling investments operating segments. the unfavorable impact of a stronger u.s. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a weaker u.s. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the euro, british pound sterling, japanese yen and philippine peso, which had a favorable impact on our europe, middle east and africa, global ventures, asia pacific and bottling investments operating segments. refer to the heading "liquidity, capital resources and financial position - foreign exchange" below.
"acquisitions and divestitures" refers to acquisitions and divestitures of brands or businesses, some of which the company considers to be structural changes. the impact of acquisitions and divestitures is the difference between the change in net operating revenues and the change in what our net operating revenues would have been if we removed the net operating revenues associated with an acquisition or divestiture from either the current year or the prior year, as applicable. management believes that quantifying the impact that acquisitions and divestitures had on the company's net operating revenues provides investors with useful information to enhance their understanding of the company's net operating revenue performance by improving their ability to compare our year-to-year results. management considers the impact of acquisitions and divestitures when evaluating the company's performance. refer to the heading "structural changes, acquired brands and newly licensed brands" above for additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures.
net operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume; price, product and geographic mix; foreign currency fluctuations; and acquisitions and divestitures. the size and timing of acquisitions and divestitures are not consistent from period to period. based on current spot rates and our hedging coverage in place, we expect foreign currency fluctuations will have a slightly favorable impact on our full year 2021 net operating revenues.
information about our net operating revenues by operating segment and corporate as a percentage of company net operating revenues is as follows:
bottling investments                      19.0                    19.9
the percentage contribution of each operating segment fluctuates over time due to net operating revenues in certain operating segments growing at a faster rate compared to other operating segments. net operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume; price, product and geographic mix; foreign currency fluctuations; and acquisitions and divestitures. for additional information about the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, refer to the heading "liquidity, capital resources and financial position - foreign exchange" below, and for additional information about acquisitions and divestitures, refer to note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
gross profit margin gross profit margin is a ratio calculated by dividing gross profit by net operating revenues. management believes gross profit margin provides investors with useful information related to the profitability of our business prior to considering all of the operating costs incurred. management uses this measure in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the company's performance.
our gross profit margin decreased to 59.3 percent in 2020 from 60.8 percent in 2019. this decrease was primarily driven by unfavorable channel and package mix, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and unfavorable manufacturing overhead variances, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. refer to note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures.
selling, general and administrative expenses the following table sets forth the components of selling, general and administrative expenses (in millions):
selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $2,372 million, or 20 percent, in 2020. this decrease was primarily due to effective cost management and a reduction in marketing spending as a result of uncertainties related to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic, the impact of savings from our productivity initiatives, the impact of a reduction in stock-based compensation expense resulting from a change in estimated payout, and a foreign currency exchange rate impact of 1 percent.
the decrease in selling and distribution expenses was primarily due to volume declines, effective cost management as a result of uncertainties related to the covid-19 pandemic and a foreign currency exchange rate impact of 2 percent, partially offset by amortization and depreciation expense in the current year for coca-cola beverages africa proprietary limited ("ccba"). during the first five months of 2019, ccba was classified as held for sale, and therefore amortization and depreciation expense were not recorded.

operating income was $8,997 million in 2020, compared to $10,086 million in 2019, a decrease of $1,089 million, or 11 percent. the decrease in operating income was primarily driven by a decline in net operating revenues due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic, an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact and higher other operating charges, partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative expenses.
operating income for each operating segment and corporate was impacted by a decline in net operating revenues due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. in addition, operating income for each operating segment and corporate was impacted by the following:
•europe, middle east and africa - lower selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by higher other operating charges and an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 3 percent;
•latin america - lower selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by higher other operating charges and an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 21 percent;
•asia pacific - lower selling, general and administrative expenses and lower other operating charges, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 1 percent;
•bottling investments - lower selling, general and administrative expenses, lower other operating charges and a favorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 1 percent; and
•corporate - operating loss in 2020 decreased primarily as a result of lower stock-based compensation expense, lower annual incentive expense and savings from productivity initiatives, partially offset by higher other operating charges and unfavorable manufacturing overhead variances due to lower volume.
in 2020, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted consolidated operating income by 6 percent due to a stronger u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, including the mexican peso, brazilian real, chilean peso and turkish lira, which had an unfavorable impact on our latin america and europe, middle east and africa operating segments. the unfavorable impact of a stronger u.s. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a weaker u.s. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the british pound sterling, japanese yen and philippine peso, which had a favorable impact on our europe, middle east and africa, global ventures, asia pacific and bottling investments operating segments. refer to the heading "liquidity, capital resources and financial position - foreign exchange" below.
interest income interest income was $370 million in 2020, compared to $563 million in 2019, a decrease of $193 million, or 34 percent. this decrease was primarily driven by lower returns in certain of our international locations, as well as the unfavorable impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
interest expense interest expense was $1,437 million in 2020, compared to $946 million in 2019, an increase of $491 million, or 52 percent. this increase was primarily due to charges of $484 million associated with the extinguishment of certain long-term debt. the increase in interest expense was also driven by higher average balances resulting from long-term debt issuances in 2020, partially offset by lower short-term u.s. interest rates and balances. refer to note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
equity income (loss) - net equity income (loss) - net represents our company's proportionate share of net income or loss from each of our equity method investees. in 2020, equity income was $978 million, compared to equity income of $1,049 million in 2019, a decrease of $71 million, or 7 percent. this decrease reflects the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on operating results reported by our equity method investees and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. in addition, the company recorded net charges of $216 million and $100 million in the line item equity income (loss) - net during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. these amounts represent the company's proportionate share of significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by certain of our equity method investees.
other income (loss) - net other income (loss) - net includes, among other things, dividend income; gains and losses related to the disposal of property, plant and equipment; gains and losses related to acquisitions and divestitures; non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefit plans; other charges and credits related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans; realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and trading debt securities; realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities; other-than-temporary impairment charges; and net foreign currency exchange gains and losses. the foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. the effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheet. refer to note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
in 2020, other income (loss) - net was income of $841 million. the company recognized a gain of $902 million in conjunction with the fairlife acquisition, which resulted from the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in fairlife to fair value, a net gain of $148 million related to realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and trading debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, a net gain of $18 million related to the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in one of our equity method investees and a gain of $17 million related to the sale of our ownership interest in an equity method investee in north america. these gains were partially offset by an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $252 million related to coca-cola bottlers japan holdings inc. ("ccbjhi"), an equity method investee, an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $38 million related to one of our equity method investees in latin america, an impairment charge of $26 million associated with an investment in an equity security without a readily determinable fair value and a net loss of $55 million related to economic hedging activities. the company also recorded net charges of $25 million related to the restructuring of our manufacturing operations in the united states and charges of $14 million for pension and other postretirement benefit plan settlements and curtailments related to the company's strategic realignment initiatives. other income (loss) - net also included income of $171 million related to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost, $72 million of dividend income and net foreign currency exchange losses of $64 million. refer to note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the fairlife acquisition. refer to note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on equity and debt securities. refer to note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our economic hedging activities. refer to note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the impairment charges. refer to note 18 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company's strategic realignment initiatives. refer to note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements for the impact these items had on our operating segments and corporate.

("andina"). these gains were partially offset by other-than-temporary impairment charges of $406 million related to ccbjhi, an equity method investee, $255 million related to certain equity method investees in the middle east, $57 million related to one of our equity method investees in north america and $49 million related to one of our equity method investees in latin america. the company also recorded an adjustment to reduce the carrying amount of ccba's fixed assets and definite-lived intangible assets by $160 million and recognized a $118 million net loss in conjunction with our acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in chi. additionally, the company recognized net charges of $105 million primarily related to post-closing adjustments as contemplated by the related agreements associated with the refranchising of certain bottling territories in north america and charges of $4 million primarily related to payments made to convert the bottling agreements for certain north america bottling partners' territories to a single new form of bottling agreement with additional requirements. other income (loss) - net also included income of $99 million related to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost, $62 million of dividend income and net foreign currency exchange losses of $120 million. refer to note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the ccba asset adjustment, refranchising activities, the north america conversion payments, the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in chi and the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in andina. refer to note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on equity and debt securities. refer to note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements for the impact these items had on our operating segments and corporate.
income taxes our effective tax rate reflects the tax benefits of having significant operations outside the united states, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the statutory u.s. rate. as a result of employment actions and capital investments made by the company, certain tax jurisdictions provide income tax incentive grants, including brazil, costa rica, singapore and swaziland. the terms of these grants expire from 2023 to 2036. we anticipate that we will be able to extend or renew the grants in these locations. tax incentive grants favorably impacted our income tax expense by $317 million and $335 million for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. in addition, our effective tax rate reflects the benefits of having significant earnings generated in investments accounted for under the equity method.

on november 18, 2020, the tax court issued the opinion regarding the company's 2015 litigation with the irs involving transfer pricing tax adjustments in which the court predominantly sided with the irs. the company disagrees with the opinion and intends to vigorously defend its position. refer to note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
as of december 31, 2020, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $915 million. if the company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be a benefit of $588 million, exclusive of any benefits related to interest and penalties. the remaining $327 million primarily represents tax benefits that would be received in different tax jurisdictions in the event the company did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions.
a reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):
balance of unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year                              $392                   $336

the increase was primarily related to a change in judgment on certain tax positions due to the opinion. refer to note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
the increase was primarily related to a change in judgment about the company's tax positions with several foreign jurisdictions.
3 the decrease was primarily related to a change in judgment about one of the company's tax positions that became certain as a result of settlement of a matter in the united states.
the company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. the company had $391 million and $201 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. of these amounts, $190 million and $11 million of expense were recognized in income tax expense in 2020 and 2019, respectively. if the company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the reversal of this accrual would be a benefit to the company's effective tax rate.
based on current tax laws, the company's effective tax rate in 2021 is expected to be approximately 19.5 percent before considering the potential impact of any significant operating and nonoperating items that may affect our effective tax rate.
liquidity, capital resources and financial position we believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of the fundamental strengths of our business. refer to the heading ''cash flows from operating activities'' below. the company does not typically raise capital through the issuance of stock. instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on shareowners' equity. refer to the heading "cash flows from financing activities" below. we have a history of borrowing funds both domestically and internationally at reasonable interest rates, and we expect to be able to continue to borrow funds at reasonable rates over the long term. our debt financing also includes the use of a commercial paper program. while the covid-19 pandemic initially caused a disruption in the commercial paper market, we currently have the ability to borrow funds in this market at levels that are consistent with our debt financing strategy and expect to continue to be able to do so in the future. the company reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly and, as a result of this review, during 2020 we issued u.s. dollar- and euro-denominated long-term debt of $15.6 billion and €2.6 billion, respectively, across various maturities with certain tranches having a longer duration than other recent long-term debt issuances. we used a portion of the proceeds from the long-term debt issuances to extinguish certain tranches of our previously issued long-term debt which had either near-term maturity dates and/or high coupon rates. while we intend to remain active in the commercial paper market, we also used a portion of the proceeds from the long-term debt issuances to reduce our commercial paper balance. refer to note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the debt issuances and extinguishments.
the company's cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities totaled $10.9 billion as of december 31, 2020. in addition to these funds, our commercial paper program and our ability to issue long-term debt, we had $7.5 billion in lines of credit for general corporate purposes as of december 31, 2020. these backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2021 through 2025.
while near-term uncertainty caused by the covid-19 pandemic remains, we expect to see improvements in our business as vaccines become more widely available. the timing and availability of vaccines will be different around the world, and therefore we believe the pace of the recovery will vary by geography depending on both vaccine distribution and other macroeconomic factors. we will remain flexible so that we can adjust to near-term uncertainties while we continue to move forward on the initiatives we implemented to emerge stronger from the covid-19 pandemic. in 2021, we plan to increase marketing spending behind our brands to drive increased net operating revenues. we expect the return on that spend to become more favorable as mobility stabilizes and away-from-home channels regain momentum. while many of the operating expenses that were significantly reduced in 2020 are likely to return in 2021, we will continue to focus on cash flow generation. our current capital allocation priorities are focused on investing wisely to support our business operations and continuing to grow our dividend payment. we currently expect 2021 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.5 billion. in addition, we do not intend to repurchase shares under our board of directors' authorized plan during the year ending december 31, 2021, and we do not intend to change our approach toward paying dividends.
we are currently in litigation with the irs for tax years 2007 through 2009. on november 18, 2020, the tax court issued the opinion in which it predominantly sided with the irs; however, a final decision is still pending and the timing of such decision is currently not known. the company strongly disagrees with the irs' positions and the portions of the opinion affirming such positions and intends to vigorously defend our positions utilizing every available avenue of appeal. while the company believes that it is more likely than not that we will ultimately prevail in this litigation upon appeal, it is possible that all, or some portion of, the adjustments proposed by the irs and sustained by the tax court could ultimately be upheld. in the event that all of the adjustments proposed by the irs are ultimately upheld for the years at issue and the irs, with the consent of the federal court, were to decide to apply the underlying methodology to the subsequent years up to and including 2020, the company currently estimates that the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability could be approximately $12 billion. once the tax court renders a final decision, the company will have 90 days to file a notice of appeal and pay the portion of the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability related to the 2007 through 2009 litigation period, which we currently estimate to be approximately $4.6 billion (including interest accrued through december 31, 2020), plus any additional interest accrued through the time of payment. refer to note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the tax litigation.
while we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail in the tax litigation discussed above, we are confident that, between our ability to generate cash flow from operations and our ability to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates, we can manage the range of possible outcomes in the final resolution of the matter.
based on all of the aforementioned factors, the company believes its current liquidity position is strong and will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for the foreseeable future.
cash flows from operating activities as part of our continued efforts to improve our working capital efficiency, we have worked with our suppliers over the past several years to revisit terms and conditions, including the extension of payment terms. our current payment terms with the majority of our suppliers are 120 days. additionally, two global financial institutions offer a voluntary supply chain finance ("scf") program which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the company to these financial institutions on a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus may be more beneficial to them. the scf program is available to suppliers of goods and services included in cost of goods sold as well as suppliers of goods and services included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. the company and our suppliers agree on the contractual terms for the goods and services we procure, including prices, quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the scf program. the suppliers sell goods or services, as applicable, to the company and issue the associated invoices to the company based on the agreed-upon contractual terms. then, if they are participating in the scf program, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine which invoices, if any, they want to sell to the financial institutions. our suppliers' voluntary inclusion of invoices in the scf program has no bearing on our payment terms. no guarantees are provided by the company or any of our subsidiaries under the scf program. we have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to participate in the scf program, and we have no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions, as it relates to the scf program. accordingly, amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the scf program are included in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet. all activity related to amounts due to suppliers that elected to participate in the scf program is reflected in the line item cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows. we have been informed by the financial institutions that as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, suppliers had elected to sell $703 million and $784 million, respectively, of our outstanding payment obligations to the financial institutions. the amount settled through the scf program was $2,810 million and $2,883 million during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019 was $9,844 million and $10,471 million, respectively, a decrease of $627 million, or 6 percent. this decrease was primarily driven by the decline in operating income, the extension of payment terms with certain of our suppliers in the prior year and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. net cash provided by operating activities included estimated benefits of $869 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 from the extension of payment terms with certain of our suppliers. we do not believe there is a risk that our payment terms will be shortened in the near future, and we do not currently expect our net cash provided by operating activities to be significantly impacted by additional extensions of payment terms in the foreseeable future.
in the fourth quarter of 2020, the company started a trade accounts receivable factoring program in certain countries. under this program we can elect to sell trade accounts receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions at a discount. in these factoring arrangements, for ease of administration, the company will collect customer payments related to the factored receivables and remit those payments to the financial institutions. the company sold $185 million of trade accounts receivables under this program during the year ended december 31, 2020, and the costs of factoring such receivables were not material. the company classifies the cash received from the financial institutions within the operating activities section in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

debt financing our company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners' equity. this exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings.
as of december 31, 2020, our long-term debt was rated "a+" by standard & poor's and "a1" by moody's. our commercial paper program was rated "a-1" by standard & poor's and "p-1" by moody's. in assessing our credit strength, both rating agencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and financial policies as well as the consolidated balance sheet and other financial information of the company. in addition, certain rating agencies also consider the financial information of certain bottlers, including ccep, coca-cola amatil limited, coca-cola consolidated, inc., coca-cola femsa and coca-cola hellenic. while the company has no legal obligation for the debt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the company's business model provides the company with an incentive to keep these bottlers viable. it is our expectation that these rating agencies will continue using this methodology. if our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure, our major bottlers' financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies' methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. additionally, if certain bottlers' credit ratings were to decline, the company's equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential increase in interest expense for those bottlers.
we monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. each rating agency employs a different aggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. these thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our company.
our global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to borrow funds at a low effective cost. this posture, coupled with active management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt and our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of borrowing. our debt management policies, in conjunction with our share repurchase program and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets.
issuances and payments of debt included both short-term and long-term financing activities. in 2020, the company had issuances of debt of $26,934 million, which included $8,260 million of issuances related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days and long-term debt issuances of $18,674 million, net of related discounts and issuance costs.
during 2020, the company made payments of debt of $28,796 million, which included $15,292 million of payments related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days and $1,768 million net issuances related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less. the company's total payments of long-term debt were $11,736 million.
in 2019, the company had issuances of debt of $23,009 million, which included $16,842 million of issuances related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days and long-term debt issuances of $6,167 million, net of related discounts and issuance costs.
during 2019, the company made payments of debt of $24,850 million, which included $17,577 million of payments related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days and $2,244 million net issuances related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less. the company's total payments of long-term debt were $5,029 million.
issuances of stock the issuances of stock in 2020 and 2019 were related to the exercise of stock options by company employees.
share repurchases in 2012, the board of directors authorized a share repurchase plan of up to 500 million shares of the company's common stock. in 2019, our board of directors authorized a new plan for the company to purchase up to an additional 150 million shares of our common stock.
during 2020, the company did not repurchase common stock under the share repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors. in 2019, the company repurchased 21 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $48.86 under the share repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors. since the inception of our share repurchase program in 1984 through december 31, 2020, we have purchased 3.5 billion shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $17.25. in addition to shares repurchased under the share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors, the company's treasury stock activity also includes shares surrendered to the company to pay the exercise price and/or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with so-called stock swap exercises of employee stock options and/or the vesting of restricted stock issued to employees. the company's treasury stock activity during 2020 resulted in a cash outflow of $118 million.
at its february 2021 meeting, our board of directors increased our regular quarterly dividend to $0.42 per share, equivalent to a full year dividend of $1.68 per share in 2021. this is our 59th consecutive annual increase. our annualized common stock dividend was $1.64 per share and $1.60 per share in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations off-balance sheet arrangements in accordance with the definition under sec rules, the following qualify as off-balance sheet arrangements:
•a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets;
•any obligation under certain derivative financial instruments; and
•any obligation arising out of a material variable interest held by the registrant in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the registrant, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the registrant.
as of december 31, 2020, we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties of $431 million, of which $109 million was related to vies. these guarantees are primarily related to third-party customers, bottlers, vendors and container manufacturing operations and have arisen through the normal course of business. these guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees is individually significant. these amounts represent the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under the guarantees. however, management has concluded that the likelihood of any significant amounts being paid by our company under these guarantees is not probable. as of december 31, 2020, we were not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity, and we did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above.
our company recognizes all derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet. refer to note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements.

refer to note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding short-term loans and notes payable. upon payment of outstanding commercial paper, we typically issue new commercial paper. lines of credit and other short-term borrowings are expected to fluctuate depending upon current liquidity needs, especially at international subsidiaries.
refer to note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding long-term debt. we will consider several alternatives to settle this long-term debt, including the use of cash flows from operating activities, issuance of commercial paper or issuance of other long-term debt. the table above shows expected cash payments to be made by the company in future periods and excludes the noncash portion of debt, including any fair market value adjustments, unamortized discounts and premiums.
we calculated estimated interest payments for our long-term debt based on the applicable rates and payment dates. for our variable-rate debt, we have assumed the december 31, 2020 rate for all years presented. we typically expect to fund such interest payments with cash flows from operating activities and/or short-term borrowings.
refer to note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding income taxes. accrued income taxes include $3,639 million related to the one-time transition tax required by the tax reform act. liabilities of $1,296 million for unrecognized tax benefits plus accrued interest and penalties were not included in the total above. at this time, the settlement period for the unrecognized tax benefits cannot be determined. in addition, any payments related to unrecognized tax benefits may be partially or fully offset by reductions in payments in other jurisdictions.
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. these agreements include long-term contractual obligations, open purchase orders, accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities. we expect to fund these purchase obligations with cash flows from operating activities.
we expect to fund these marketing obligations with cash flows from operating activities.
the total accrued benefit liability for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of december 31, 2020 was $2,299 million. refer to note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements. this amount is impacted by, among other items, net periodic benefit cost or income, funding levels, plan amendments, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and the investment return on plan assets. because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs, we did not include this amount in the table above.
we generally expect to fund all future pension contributions with cash flows from operating activities. our international pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations. the company expects to contribute $25 million in 2021 to our pension trusts, all of which will be allocated to our international plans. refer to note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements. we did not include our estimated contributions to our pension trusts in the table above.
as of december 31, 2020, the projected benefit obligation of the u.s. qualified pension plans was $6,019 million, and the fair value of the plans' assets was $5,373 million. the projected benefit obligation of all pension plans other than the u.s. qualified pension plans was $3,395 million, and the fair value of the plans' assets was $3,266 million. the majority of this underfunding is attributable to an international pension plan for certain non-u.s. employees that is unfunded due to tax law restrictions as well as certain unfunded u.s. nonqualified pension plans. these u.s. nonqualified pension plans provide, for certain employees, benefits that are not permitted to be funded through a qualified plan because of limits imposed by the internal revenue code of 1986. the expected benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans are not included in the table above. however, we anticipate annual benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans to be $108 million in 2021, $57 million in 2022 and increasing to $64 million by 2025. thereafter, the annual benefit payments will decrease. refer to note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
in general, we are self-insured for large portions of many different types of claims; however, we do use commercial insurance above our self-insured retentions to reduce the company's risk of catastrophic loss. our reserves for the company's self-insured losses are estimated using actuarial methods and assumptions of the insurance industry, adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claims history. as of december 31, 2020, our self-insurance reserves totaled $265 million. refer to note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements. we did not include estimated payments related to our self-insurance reserves in the table above.
deferred income tax liabilities as of december 31, 2020 were $1,833 million. refer to note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements. this amount is not included in the table above because we believe that presentation would not be meaningful. deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the underlying assets or liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. the results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future years. as a result, scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading, because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs.
in connection with our acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in fairlife, we are subject to making future milestone payments which are contingent on fairlife achieving certain financial targets through 2024 and, if achieved, are payable in 2021, 2023 and 2025. these milestone payments are based on agreed-upon formulas related to fairlife's operating results, the resulting values of which are not subject to a ceiling. based on fairlife's operating results in 2020, we anticipate making the first milestone payment of $100 million during the first quarter of 2021. as of december 31, 2020, we have accrued $321 million, which represents our best estimate of the present value of these milestone payments. these estimated milestone payments are not included in the table above.
as of december 31, 2020, the company had entered into a lease agreement for a production facility, which commences in the first quarter of 2021. under the agreement, the company will make future payments of approximately $540 million over the expected term, assuming we do not exercise any of the contractual purchase options. these future payments are not included in the table above.
additionally, under the terms of the agreement for our investment in ba sports nutrition, llc ("bodyarmor"), the company has an option to acquire the remaining ownership interests in bodyarmor based on an agreed-upon formula, which becomes exercisable in 2021. upon the expiration of the company's option, bodyarmor can exercise an option on behalf of the other equity owners to sell their remaining interests to the company based on the same agreed-upon formula. the company intends on exercising its option; however, the acquisition is subject to regulatory approval. any potential payments related to this potential acquisition are not included in the table above.
foreign exchange our international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks, including currency fluctuations and governmental actions. we closely monitor our operations in each country and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to changing economic and political environments as well as to fluctuations in currencies.
in 2020, we used 70 functional currencies in addition to the u.s. dollar. due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some of these currencies may be offset by strength in others.
in 2020 and 2019, the weighted-average exchange rates for foreign currencies in which the company conducted operations (all operating currencies), and for certain individual currencies, strengthened (weakened) against the u.s. dollar as follows:
british pound sterling                 1                    (4)
the percentages in the table above do not include the effects of our hedging activities and, therefore, do not reflect the actual impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our operating results. our foreign currency management program is designed to mitigate, over time, a portion of the potentially unfavorable impact of exchange rate changes on our net income and earnings per share.
the total currency impact on net operating revenues, including the effect of our hedging activities, was a decrease of 2 percent and 4 percent in 2020 and 2019, respectively. the total currency impact on income before income taxes, including the effect of our hedging activities, was a decrease of 6 percent and 10 percent in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. the effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheet. refer to note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements. foreign currency exchange gains and losses are included as a component of other income (loss) - net in our consolidated statement of income. refer to the heading "operations review - other income (loss) - net" above. the company recorded net foreign currency exchange losses of $64 million and $120 million during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
impact of inflation and changing prices inflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world. in general, we believe that, over time, we will be able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability.

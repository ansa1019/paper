item 7.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general our fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to september 30. all references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted.
overview starbucks results for fiscal 2020 reflect the challenges our business faced with the covid-19 pandemic, which severely impacted our results, particularly during the second and third fiscal quarters. consolidated revenues declined 11% to $23.5 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $26.5 billion in fiscal 2019 driven by temporary closures of a significant number of our company-operated and licensed stores, as well as modified business operations and reduced customer traffic. we gradually reopened our stores and, since then, have seen sequential improvements in comparable store sales in both our americas and international segments as transaction volumes continue to climb, reflecting the resilience of our business model and the strength of our brand.
comparable store sales for the americas segment declined by 12% for fiscal 2020, primarily due to the temporary store closures, reduced customer traffic and shortened store hours. the most negative impacts occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2020. most company-operated and licensed stores were re-opened as of early may, and over 60% of company-operated stores in the u.s. provided limited seating by the end of the fiscal year. to help protect the health and welfare of our partners, we incurred incremental labor costs, including paying the wages and benefits to partners who were either unable or uncomfortable working from mid-march through may, a temporary wage increase for partners who continued working during this period and additional benefits to furloughed or separated partners resulting from reduced store hours. the incremental wages incurred were partially offset by qualified tax credits provided by the coronavirus aid, relief and economic security act ("cares act") and the canada emergency wage subsidy ("cews"). in june 2020, we announced a plan to optimize our north america store portfolio, primarily in dense, metropolitan markets, by blending store formats to better cater to changing customer tastes and preferences. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we closed approximately 100 stores in the u.s. and canada, and we expect to close an additional 700 stores in those markets over the next 18 months. this reflects an additional 200 store closures than the initial announcement estimate of 600 stores. costs incurred related to the restructuring efforts are recorded as restructuring and impairments on our consolidated statement of earnings and will continue to be recorded in accordance with the anticipated timeline of store closures.
for the international segment, comparable store sales declined by 19% for fiscal 2020, mostly due to the 31% and 37% reduction in comparable store sales during the second and third fiscal quarters of 2020, respectively. company-operated stores in the china market began re-opening in the fiscal second quarter, and nearly all company-operated stores were open by the end of the fiscal third quarter. to support our international licensees in their recovery efforts, we extended more flexible development and financial terms, including waiving royalty payments during the fiscal third quarter.
revenue for our channel development segment declined $68 million, or 3%, when compared with fiscal 2019. this is largely due to the lapping of global coffee alliance transition-related activities, including higher inventory sales in the prior year as nestlé prepared to fulfill customer orders. these are partially offset by the continued growth of the global coffee alliance during fiscal 2020.
throughout the second half of fiscal 2020, we experienced initial business recovery as our stores gradually reopened under modified operations to meet public health guidelines and evolving customer behaviors and expectations. as of september 27, 2020, nearly all of our company-operated and licensed stores were re-opened. those that have remained closed are located in travel or transportation hubs as well as central business districts. our global business is recovering steadily, with china approaching comparable store sales recovery and the u.s. demonstrating continued upward momentum in sales and profitability. our channel development segment continues to grow category share as customers adjust to their at-home routines. in fiscal 2021, we expect lower revenues for the segment as we transitioned our single-serve coffee business to a more royalty-based model. we do not expect the change to have a material impact on our earnings. however, the change is anticipated to have an accretive impact on operating margin for the segment.
we continue to invest in technologies and innovations to elevate the customer and partner experience and to drive long-term growth. by reimagining our store formats, we are moving swiftly to adapt to new customer behaviors. absent significant covid-19 relapses or global economic disruptions, and based on the current trend of our retail business recovery and our focused efforts to expand contactless customer experiences, digital capabilities and beverage innovation, we believe we are well positioned to regain the positive business momentum we had demonstrated prior to the pandemic.
financial highlights
•consolidated operating income decreased to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to operating income of $4.1 billion in fiscal 2019. fiscal 2020 operating margin was 6.6% compared to 15.4% in fiscal 2019. operating margin contraction was primarily driven by sales deleverage and additional costs incurred attributable to covid-19, including catastrophe pay and enhanced pay programs for retail store partners, net of benefits provided by government subsidies. higher restructuring activities related to our americas store portfolio optimization and investments to support key business partners also contributed. these decreases were partially offset by sales leverage realized in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 prior to the onset of covid-19 impacts and supply chain efficiencies.
•earnings per share ("eps") for fiscal 2020 decreased to $0.79, compared to eps of $2.92 in fiscal 2019. the decrease was primarily driven by the adverse impacts of covid-19, including lower revenues due to temporary store closures, reduced customer traffic and modified operations, as well as incremental labor expenses and restructuring costs.
•capital expenditures were $1.5 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $1.8 billion in fiscal 2019 primarily due to a pause in new store openings due to covid-19.

revenues fiscal year ended                      sep 27,            sep 29,          %change total net revenues decreased $3.0 billion, or 11%, over fiscal 2019, primarily due to lower revenues from company-operated stores ($2.4 billion). the decline in company-operated store revenue was due to a 14% decrease in comparable store sales ($2.9 billion), attributable to a 22% decrease in comparable transactions, partially offset by a 10% increase in average ticket. also contributing to the decrease were the conversions of our retail businesses in thailand, france and the netherlands to fully licensed markets during fiscal 2019 ($204 million). partially offsetting these decreases were the incremental revenues from 806 net new starbucks® company-operated store openings, or a 5% increase, over the past 12 months ($718 million).
other revenues decreased $63 million, primarily due to the lapping of a higher volume of transition activities related to the global coffee alliance and the tazo brand sale, partially offset by higher sales from the growth of the global coffee alliance.

product and distribution costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily due to sales deleverage attributable to covid-19 impacts, which included inventory write-offs and product waste (approximately 10 basis points), partially offset by supply chain efficiencies (approximately 60 basis points).
store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 620 basis points. store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues increased 750 basis points, primarily due to sales deleverage attributable to covid-19 impacts, which included catastrophe pay and enhanced pay programs for retail partners, net of benefits provided by temporary subsidies from the u.s. and certain foreign governments (approximately 150 basis points).
other operating expenses increased $59 million, primarily due to incremental costs to develop and grow the global coffee alliance.
depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 90 basis points, primarily due to sales deleverage.
general and administrative expenses decreased $145 million, primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation ($63 million), lapping of the 2018 u.s stock award granted in fiscal 2018, which was funded by savings from the tax cuts and jobs act enacted in december 2017 ("tax act") and vested in fiscal 2019 ($61 million), and lapping of the 2019 starbucks leadership experience in chicago ($52 million), partially offset by incremental strategic investments in technology.
restructuring and impairment expenses increased $143 million, primarily due to higher asset impairment related to our north america store portfolio optimization ($136 million), higher lease-related costs associated with the closure of certain company-operated stores ($28 million) and intangible asset impairment related to changes in our branding and marketing strategies ($22 million). partially offsetting theses increases were lower severance costs ($38 million) and lapping the impairment related to our switzerland retail market ($10 million).
income from equity investees increased $25 million, primarily due to higher income from our north american coffee partnership joint venture and growth in our south korea joint venture.
the combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 880 basis points in fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019.

net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations decreased $623 million due to lapping the sale of retail operations in thailand, france and the netherlands in fiscal 2019.
interest expense increased $106 million primarily due to additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in march 2020 and may 2020.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was 20.6% compared to 19.5% for fiscal 2019. the increase was primarily due to the valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets of certain international jurisdictions (approximately 980 basis points). this unfavorable impact was partially offset by lower pre-tax earnings including the foreign rate differential on our jurisdictional mix of earnings (approximately 340 basis points), stock-based compensation excess tax benefits in relation to pre-tax earnings (approximately 250 basis points), remeasurement of deferred tax assets due to enacted corporate rate change (approximately 220 basis points) and the impact of changes in indefinite reinvestment assertions for certain foreign subsidiaries in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 (approximately 170 basis points). see note 14, income taxes, for further discussion.

revenues americas total net revenues for fiscal 2020 decreased $1.9 billion, or 10%, primarily due to a 12% decrease in comparable store sales ($1.9 billion) driven by a 21% decrease in transactions, partially offset by an 11% increase in average ticket. also contributing were lower product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($354 million). these decreases were partially offset by 134 net new starbucks® company-operated stores, or a 1% increase, over the past 12 months ($436 million).
operating margin americas operating income for fiscal 2020 decreased 52% to $1.8 billion, compared to $3.8 billion in fiscal 2019. operating margin decreased 960 basis points to 11.1%, primarily due to sales deleverage attributed to reduced labor productivity and additional costs incurred as a result of covid-19, mainly catastrophe pay and enhanced pay programs for retail store partners incurred primarily during the fiscal third quarter, net of benefits provided by the cares act and cews (approximately 180 basis points). higher restructuring expenses relating to our north america portfolio optimization (approximately 130 basis points) also contributed to the decrease. partially offsetting these decreases were sales leverage realized prior to the onset of covid-19 and pricing increases.

operating margin international operating income for fiscal 2020 decreased 63% to $354 million, compared to $965 million in fiscal 2019. operating margin decreased 870 basis points to 6.9%, primarily driven by sales deleverage concentrated in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2020 attributable to covid-19, including continued partner wages and benefits as well as occupancy costs. royalty relief granted to licensees during the third fiscal quarter also contributed to the decline (approximately 80 basis points).

revenues channel development total net revenues for fiscal 2020 decreased $68 million, or 3% compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to the lapping of higher transition activities related to the global coffee alliance ($115 million) and product sales to unilever as a result of the sale and transition of the tazo brand ($34 million). these were partially offset by the expansion of the global coffee alliance ($70 million), as at-home coffee consumption grew while the foodservice business experienced softening due to covid-19.
operating margin channel development operating income for fiscal 2020 decreased 1% to $687 million, compared to $698 million in fiscal 2019. operating margin increased 70 basis points to 35.7%, primarily due to the transfer of certain single-serve products to nestlé as part of the global coffee alliance (approximately 150 basis points), strong performance from our north american coffee partnership joint venture (approximately 80 basis points) and lapping the correction of amortization expense (approximately 60 basis points) in the prior year, partially offset by certain transition items related to the global coffee alliance (approximately 190 basis points).

corporate and other primarily consists of our unallocated corporate expenses and evolution fresh. unallocated corporate expenses include corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments.
corporate and other operating loss decreased to $1.3 billion for fiscal 2020, or 5%, compared to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2019. this decrease was primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation and lapping of the 2018 u.s stock award granted in fiscal 2018, which was funded by savings from the tax act and vested in fiscal 2019, partially offset by incremental strategic investments in technology.
2019               2018                    change net revenues:
total net revenues increased $1.8 billion, or 7%, over fiscal 2018, primarily driven by higher revenues from company-operated stores ($1.9 billion). the growth in company-operated store revenues was driven by incremental revenues from 947 net new starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($957 million) and a 5% increase in comparable store sales ($879 million), attributable to a 3% increase in average ticket and a 2% increase in comparable transactions. these increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($189 million) and the conversion of our thailand, france and the netherlands retail businesses to fully licensed markets during fiscal 2019 ($161 million).
licensed store revenue growth also contributed to the increase in total net revenues ($223 million), primarily due to higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($228 million), largely due to the opening of 992 net new starbucks® licensed stores over the past 12 months, and the conversion of our thailand, france and the netherlands retail businesses to fully licensed markets ($35 million), partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($41 million).
other revenues decreased $288 million, primarily driven by the licensing of our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé. partially offsetting this decrease was growth in product revenue, primarily premium single-serve products, in connection with the global coffee alliance.

product and distribution costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 10 basis points, primarily due to licensing our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé (approximately 80 basis points), partially offset by cost savings initiatives (approximately 70 basis points) and leverage on product and distribution costs, largely driven by price increases.
store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 130 basis points. store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues increased 60 basis points, primarily driven by investments in our store partners that are funded by savings from the tax act and growth in wages and benefits (approximately 120 basis points), largely in the americas segment, partially offset by sales leverage driven by price increases and the impact of the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage.
other operating expenses decreased $184 million, primarily due to cost savings related to licensing our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé ($176 million) and lapping prior year costs associated with the establishment of the global coffee alliance ($34 million), including business taxes associated with the up-front prepaid royalty from nestlé and headcount-related costs, primarily relating to employee bonus and retention costs.
depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 20 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in east china (approximately 20 basis points).
general and administrative expenses increased $116 million, primarily driven by higher performance-based compensation ($89 million) and the 2019 starbucks leadership experience in chicago, heavily concentrated in our fiscal fourth quarter ($52 million).
restructuring and impairment expenses decreased $89 million, primarily due to lower restructuring and impairment costs related to teavanatm/mc retail store closures ($128 million) and lower impairments related to our switzerland retail market ($27 million), partially offset by higher exit costs associated with the closure of certain starbucks® company-operated stores ($32 million) and severance costs ($25 million).
income from equity investees decreased $3 million, primarily due to the impact of our ownership changes in east china. this decrease was partially offset by improved comparable store sales from our joint venture in south korea and higher income from our north american coffee partnership joint venture.
the combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 30 basis points in fiscal 2019 when compared to fiscal 2018.

net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations was primarily due to the sale of our thailand, france and the netherlands retail operations in fiscal 2019. the gain in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the sale of our tazo brand and taiwan joint venture, partially offset by the net loss from the sale of our brazil retail operations in fiscal 2018.
interest income and other, net decreased $95 million, primarily due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance on a prospective basis, which required estimated breakage on unredeemed store value cards to be recorded as revenue. we recorded stored value card breakage in interest income and other, net in the prior year.
interest expense increased $161 million primarily due to additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in november 2017, march 2018, august 2018 and may 2019.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 19.5% compared to 21.8% for fiscal 2018. the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the lower corporate tax rate as a result of the tax act (approximately 350 basis points), lapping prior year's transition tax on our accumulated undistributed foreign earnings and remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities (approximately 300 basis points), higher stock-based compensation excess tax benefit (approximately 140 basis points), the release of income tax reserves related to the settlement of a u.s. tax examination and the expiration of statute of limitations (approximately 130 basis points) and the tax impacts of the gain on the sale of our thailand retail operations (approximately 130 basis points). these favorable impacts were partially offset by the lapping of prior year's gain on the purchase of our east china joint venture that was not subject to income tax (approximately 580 basis points) and the impact of changes in indefinite reinvestment assertions for certain foreign subsidiaries during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 (approximately 170 basis points). see note 14, income taxes, for further discussion.

revenues americas total net revenues for fiscal 2019 increased $1.5 billion, or 9%, primarily driven by a 5% increase in comparable store sales ($744 million) and 282 net new starbucks® company-operated stores, or a 3% increase, over the past 12 months ($580 million). also contributing were higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($144 million), primarily resulting from comparable store sales growth and the opening of 323 net new starbucks® licensed stores, or 4% increase, over the past 12 months and the impact of the adoption of revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage ($119 million).
operating margin americas operating income for fiscal 2019 increased 9% to $3.8 billion, compared to $3.5 billion in fiscal 2018. operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 20.7%, primarily driven by higher partner investments, largely funded by savings from the tax act, growth in wages and benefits (approximately 130 basis points) and to a much lesser extent, investments in labor hours heavily concentrated in our fiscal fourth quarter. partially offsetting these were cost savings initiatives, primarily in product and distribution costs (approximately 90 basis points), the impact of the adoption of revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage (approximately 50 basis points) and sales leverage.

discussion of our international segment results below reflects the impact of fully consolidating our east china business from an equity method joint venture to a company-operated market since the acquisition date of december 31, 2017. under the joint venture model, we recognized royalties and product sales within revenue and related product and distribution costs as well as our proportionate share of east china's net earnings, which resulted in a higher margin business. under the company-operated ownership model, east china's operating results are reflected in most income statement lines of this segment.
revenues international total net revenues for fiscal 2019 increased $640 million, or 12%%, primarily driven by 665 net new starbucks® company-operated stores, or a 12% increase, over the past 12 months ($377 million), the ownership change in east china ($280 million) and a 3% increase in comparable store sales ($135 million). also contributing were increased product sales to and royalty revenues from licensees ($84 million), primarily resulting from opening of 669 net new starbucks® licensed stores, or an 11% increase, over the past 12 months and the impact of the adoption of revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage ($20 million). these increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($183 million) and the conversion of our thailand, france and the netherlands retail businesses to fully licensed markets ($126 million).
operating margin international operating income for fiscal 2019 increased 11% to $965 million, compared to $873 million in fiscal 2018. operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 15.6%, primarily driven by strategic investments to support growth in china (approximately 80 basis points) and growth in wages and benefits (approximately 70 basis points), primarily offset by cost savings initiatives (approximately 80 basis points) and labor efficiencies (approximately 70 basis points).

our channel development segment results reflect the impact of the licensing of our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, which we lapped late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. our collaborative business relationships for our global ready-to-drink products and the associated revenues remain unchanged due to the global coffee alliance.
revenues channel development net revenues for fiscal 2019 decreased $305 million, or 13%, when compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by licensing our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé ($329 million), offset by growth in product revenue, primarily premium single-serve products, in connection with our global coffee alliance ($25 million).
operating margin channel development operating income for fiscal 2019 decreased 25% to $698 million, compared to $927 million in fiscal 2018. operating margin decreased 540 basis points to 35.0%, primarily driven by licensing our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé (approximately 640 basis points), partially offset by lapping prior year costs associated with the establishment of the global coffee alliance (approximately 140 basis points), including business taxes associated with the up-front prepaid royalty and headcount-related costs, primarily related to employee bonus and retention costs.

corporate and other primarily consists of our unallocated corporate expenses, as well as evolution fresh and the legacy operations of the teavana retail business, which substantially ceased during fiscal 2018. unallocated corporate expenses include corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments.
financial condition, liquidity and capital resources cash and investment overview our cash and investments were $4.8 billion and $3.0 billion as of september 27, 2020 and september 29, 2019, respectively. in fiscal 2020, cash and investments increased by $1.8 billion primarily due to the issuance of short-term and long-term debt as well as lower share repurchases following the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program in march 2020. these liquidity increases offset lower retail cash inflows due to temporary store closures and modified operations resulting from the covid-19 pandemic. we actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, make acquisitions and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (domestic and foreign) and commercial paper. as of september 27, 2020, approximately $2.0 billion of cash was held in foreign subsidiaries.
borrowing capacity credit facilities and commercial paper our total contractual borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes was $2.7 billion as of the end of fiscal 2020 when combining the unused commercial paper program and credit facilities discussed below, less outstanding borrowing.
revolving lines of credit our $2.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility ("the 2018 credit facility"), of which $150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on october 25, 2022. we have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $500 million. borrowings under the credit facility are subject to terms defined within the 2018 credit facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on libor, and, for u.s. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a base rate, in each case plus an applicable margin. the applicable margin is based on the better of (i) the company's long-term credit ratings assigned by moody's and standard & poor's rating agencies and (ii) the company's fixed charge coverage ratio, pursuant to a pricing grid set forth in the five-year credit agreement. the current applicable margin is 1.100% for eurocurrency rate loans and 0.000% (nil) for base rate loans. the 2018 credit facility is available for general corporate purposes. as of september 27, 2020, we had no borrowings under the 2018 credit facility.
our $1.0 billion unsecured 364-day credit facility (the "364-day credit facility"), of which no amount may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on september 22, 2021. we have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $500 million. borrowings under the credit facility are subject to terms defined within the 364-day credit facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on libor, and, for u.s. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a base rate, in each case plus an applicable margin. the applicable margin is based on the better of (i) the company's long-term credit ratings assigned by moody's and standard & poor's rating agencies and (ii) the company's fixed charge coverage ratio, pursuant to a pricing grid set forth in the 364-day credit agreement. the applicable margin is 1.150% for eurocurrency rate loans and 0.150% for base rate loans. the 364-day credit facility is available for general corporate purposes. as of september 27, 2020, we had no borrowings under the 364-day credit facility.
due to the financial impacts from covid-19, we reached an agreement with our lenders to amend the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant for our combined $3.0 billion revolving lines of credit, through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.
commercial paper under our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under the 2018 and 364-day credit facilities discussed above. the proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. as of september 27, 2020, we had borrowings of $296.5 million outstanding, net of unamortized discount, under our commercial paper program, of which a majority will mature during the second quarter of fiscal 2021.
credit facilities in japan additionally, we hold japanese yen-denominated credit facilities which are available for working capital needs and capital expenditures within our japanese market.
during the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we expanded our ¥1 billion unsecured credit facility to ¥5 billion, or $47.4 million, as of september 27, 2020. this facility is currently set to mature on december 31, 2020. borrowings under the credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on tibor plus an applicable margin of 0.400%. additionally during the third quarter, we expanded our ¥2 billion unsecured credit facility to ¥10 billion, or $94.9 million, as of september 27, 2020. this facility is currently set to mature on march 26, 2021. borrowings under the credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on tibor plus 0.300%. as of september 27, 2020, we had $142.3 million of borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities.
in october 2020, we entered into a new ¥10 billion unsecured facility, or approximately $95 million as of october 29, 2020. this facility is set to mature on october 29, 2021. borrowings under the credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on tibor plus an applicable margin of 0.350%.
long-term debt on may 7, 2020, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $500 million of 1.300% senior notes (the"2022 notes") due may 2022, $1.25 billion of 2.550% senior notes (the "2030 notes") due november 2030 and $1.25 billion of 3.500% senior notes (the "2050 notes") due november 2050. we are using the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes and for future repayments of outstanding indebtedness. interest on the 2022 notes is payable semi-annually on may 7 and november 7, commencing on november 7, 2020. interest on the 2030 notes and the 2050 notes is payable semi-annually on may 15 and november 15, commencing on november 15, 2020.
on march 12, 2020, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $500 million of 2.000% senior notes (the "2027 notes") due march 2027, $750 million of 2.250% senior notes (the "2030 notes") due march 2030 and $500 million of 3.350% senior notes (the "2050 notes") due march 2050. we are using the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program. we may temporarily invest funds that are not immediately needed for these purposes in short-term investments, including marketable securities. interest on the 2027 notes, the 2030 notes and the 2050 notes is payable semi-annually on march 12 and september 12, commencing on september 12, 2020.
see note 9, debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k for details of the components of our long-term debt.
our ability to incur new liens and conduct sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties is subject to compliance with terms of the indentures under which the senior notes were issued. as of september 27, 2020, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants.
use of cash we expect to use our available cash and investments, including, but not limited to, additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities, commercial paper program and the issuance of debt to support and invest in our core businesses, including investing in new ways to serve our customers and supporting our store partners, repaying maturing debts, as well as returning cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and discretionary share repurchases and investing in new business opportunities related to our core and developing businesses. further, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees. we may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our "growth at scale" agenda. acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees. any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy.
we believe that net future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future. significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and/or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. we have borrowed funds and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates; however, additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future. in this regard, we may incur additional debt, within targeted levels, as part of our plans to fund our capital programs, including cash returns to shareholders through future dividends and discretionary share repurchases. to further strengthen our liquidity in the near term, we currently expect the suspension of share repurchases to continue through the end of fiscal 2021. if necessary, we may pursue additional sources of financing, including both short-term and long-term borrowings and debt issuances.
we regularly review our cash positions and our determination of indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings. in the event we determine that all or a portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and u.s. state income taxes, which could be material. we do not anticipate the need for repatriated funds to the u.s. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs. see note 14, income taxes, for further discussion.
during fiscal 2020, we entered into a new $500 million unsecured 364-day term-loan facility ("the 2020 term-loan facility") which we drew on and subsequently repaid within the fiscal year. the 2020 term-loan facility was originally set to mature on march 19, 2021.
during each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2019, we declared a cash dividend to shareholders of $0.36 per share. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2020, we declared a cash dividend of $0.41 per share. dividends are paid in the quarter following the declaration date. cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal 2020 and 2019 totaled $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. subsequent to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we declared a cash dividend of $0.45 per share to be paid on november 27, 2020 with an expected payout of approximately $527.9 million. as of the date of this report, we do not expect to reduce our quarterly dividend as a result of the covid-19 pandemic.
in september 2018, we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements ("asr agreements") with third-party financial institutions totaling $5.0 billion, effective october 1, 2018. we made a $5.0 billion up-front payment to the financial institutions and received an initial delivery of 72.0 million shares of our common stock. in march 2019, we received an additional 4.9 million shares upon the completion of the program based on a volume-weighted average share price (less discount) of $65.03.
additionally, in march 2019, we entered into asr agreements with third-party financial institutions totaling $2.0 billion, effective march 22, 2019. we made a $2.0 billion up-front payment to the financial institutions and received an initial delivery of 22.2 million shares of our common stock. in june 2019, we received an additional 3.9 million shares upon the completion of the program based on a volume-weighted average share price (less discount) of $76.50.
outside of the asr agreements noted above, we repurchased 36.6 million shares of common stock for $3.1 billion on the open market during the fiscal year ended september 29, 2019. in total, we repurchased 139.6 million shares at a total cost of $10.1 billion for the fiscal year ended september 29, 2019.
our board of directors approved an increase of 120 million and 40 million shares to our ongoing share repurchase program during the fiscal first quarter of 2019 and fiscal second quarter of 2020, respectively. we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in march 2020. prior to the suspension, we repurchased 20.3 million shares of common stock for $1.7 billion on the open market during the year ended september 27, 2020. as of september 27, 2020, 48.9 million shares remained available for repurchase under current authorizations. the existing share repurchase program remains authorized by the board of directors. the suspension of the share repurchases is currently expected to continue through fiscal 2021, and we may resume share repurchases in the future at any time, depending upon operating results, our capital needs and other factors.
other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2021 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for investments in our new and existing stores and our supply chain and corporate facilities. total capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 are expected to be approximately $1.9 billion.
cash flows cash provided by operating activities was $1.6 billion for fiscal 2020, compared to $5.0 billion for fiscal 2019. the change was primarily due to temporary retail store closures resulting from the covid-19 pandemic, the u.s. federal tax payment related to the nestlé transaction and the timing of other tax payments and refunds.
cash used in investing activities totaled $1.7 billion for fiscal 2020, compared to $1.0 billion for fiscal 2019. the change was primarily driven by lapping proceeds from the divestiture of certain operations related to the conversions of our retail businesses in thailand, france and the netherlands to fully licensed markets during 2019 and an increase in purchase of investments in fiscal 2020. this was partially offset by lower capital expenditures for new and existing stores.
cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2020 totaled $1.7 billion, compared to cash used in financing activities of $10.1 billion for fiscal 2019. the change was primarily due to higher repurchases of our common stock under accelerated share repurchase agreements in fiscal 2019 and higher proceeds from issuance of long-term debt in fiscal 2020.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of september 27, 2020, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (in millions):
(1)we have excluded long-term gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties of $137.5 million from the amounts presented as the timing of these obligations is uncertain.
(3)purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on starbucks and that specify all significant terms. green coffee purchase commitments comprise 93% of total purchase obligations.
(4)other obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of the tax act transition tax, asset retirement obligations, valor siren ventures i l.p. (vsv) investment and hedging instruments.
starbucks currently expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business.
off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements relate to purchase commitments detailed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k.
commodity prices, availability and general risk conditions commodity price risk represents starbucks primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. we purchase, roast and sell high-quality arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. in addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. the price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. for additional details see product supply in item 1, as well as risk factors in item 1a of this 10-k.
financial risk management market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices and interest rates. we manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. the market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk. risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity. we also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk, which we consider to be low. we use interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks to primarily hedge against changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances and cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange debt instruments to hedge against changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt and foreign exchange exposure of net investments in japan. excluding interest rate hedging instruments, cross currency swaps and foreign currency debt, hedging instruments generally do not have maturities in excess of three years. refer to note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, and note 3, derivative financial instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k for further discussion of our hedging instruments.
the sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. the actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses.
commodity price risk we purchase commodity inputs, primarily coffee, dairy products, diesel, cocoa, sugar and other commodities, that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. we use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts, such as fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases, and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure.
the following table summarizes the potential impact as of september 27, 2020 to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income ("oci") from changes in commodity prices. the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions):

foreign currency exchange risk the majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in u.s. dollars. however, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the u.s., we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the chinese renminbi, japanese yen, canadian dollar, british pound, south korean won and euro. to reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases, intercompany borrowing and lending activities and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements, as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items. the volatility in the foreign exchange market may lead to significant fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates and adversely impact our financial results in the case of weakening foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. see note 3, derivative financial instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k for further discussion.

equity security price risk we have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds within our marketable equity securities portfolio. marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our management deferred compensation plan ("mdcp"). gains and losses from the portfolio and the change in our mdcp liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings.
we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of september 27, 2020 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.
interest rate risk long-term debt we utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixed-rate debt, as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. see note 3, derivative financial instruments and note 9, debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our long-term debt, respectively, as of september 27, 2020.

available-for-sale debt securities our available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investment-grade debt securities. the primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity. available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. we do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our investments. we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of september 27, 2020 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.
application of critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, especially in light of the current economic environment due to the covid-19 pandemic. judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k. we believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity.
we consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. during the past five fiscal years, we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below, unless noted otherwise.
property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived assets we evaluate property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use ("rou") assets and other finite-lived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. when evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated future undiscounted cash flows. if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset's carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life.
long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. for company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level, which is inclusive of property, plant and equipment and lease rou assets. the fair value of a store's assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. for other long-lived assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions, or comparable company analyses.
our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate. for company-operated stores, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store's historical performance, the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store's performance. the discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. these estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance.
in each of the three fiscal years prior to fiscal 2020, our business has operated at levels of growth and profitability that have not required material numbers of our store assets to be reviewed for potential impairment. given the substantial reduction in our revenues and cash flows as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, primarily in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, along with our announced restructuring plans to close up to 800 of our company-operated stores in the u.s. and canada in the next 18 months, we identified triggering events that required us to assess the need for potential impairment charges for a larger number of company-operated stores in fiscal 2020 than in prior years. as a result of these activities, we recorded store impairment charges of $298.9 million in fiscal 2020, of which $239.3 million was included in restructuring and impairment expenses on our consolidated statement of earnings. the magnitude of these charges was not particularly sensitive to variations in fair value inputs, as the majority of charges recorded were the result of full impairments of stores identified for closure, based on factors such as the format and location of the store or its current operating performance. excluding stores in areas impacted by our restructuring plans, our company-operated store portfolio is projecting a return to pre-covid-19 levels of operations and cash flow recoverability within the next 12 months. however, irrespective of the above, our expectations of business recovery trends may vary materially in future periods based on the pace of global and market-specific recovery from the covid-19 pandemic.
as of september 27, 2020, we had identified 405 stores in the u.s. and canada for closure under our restructuring plans. we expect to potentially identify up to another 395 stores for closure. we expect total future restructuring costs, which are attributable to our americas segment, to range from approximately $260 million to $400 million. these restructuring costs include accelerated amortization or impairments of rou assets due to planned store closures prior to the end of contractual lease terms ($150 million to $190 million), store asset impairment and disposal costs not previously recorded as part of our ongoing store impairment process ($100 million to $190 million) and the remaining amount relates to employee termination costs. our estimates of future restructuring costs are based on actual costs incurred for recently closed stores of similar profile under the restructuring plans. as we have previously recorded impairment charges in fiscal 2020 for stores that may be identified for closure under our plans, and because store closure decisions are still subject to change, the final costs associated with these store closures may be different from the initial estimates. these costs will depend on the asset carrying value and remaining lease term for each store identified. future restructuring costs are expected to be incurred over the next 18 months as stores are specifically identified for closure or, in the case of lease exit costs, when the stores cease operations.
asset impairment charges are discussed in note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate impairment may exist. when evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. if we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows or a combination of discounted cash flow and market approaches.
when assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors, inclusive of the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit's estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition. if we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit's goodwill, our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses, product innovation and new store concepts, as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies and selecting an appropriate discount rate. estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit's past performance and forecasted growth, including assumptions regarding business recovery post covid-19, strategic initiatives, local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit's performance. the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region. these estimates, as well as the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples used in the market approaches are highly subjective, and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. our goodwill impairment assessments were not significantly altered as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. we continue to believe the fair value of each of our reporting units is significantly in excess of its carrying value, and absent a sustained multi-year global decline in our business in key markets such as the u.s. and china, we do not anticipate incurring significant goodwill impairment in the next 12 months.
when assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, where we perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist. if we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed, management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group. the fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth, which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset group's forecasted growth, including assumptions regarding business recovery post covid-19, and royalty rates, which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances. the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business. these estimates are highly subjective, and our ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. during fiscal 2020, we recorded a charge of $22.1 million relating to the impairment of an indefinite-lived intangible asset due to changes in branding and marketing strategy. the amount of charge taken was not materially impacted by our choice of fair value assumptions, and we do not anticipate recording significant impairment charges in the next 12 months.
definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges are discussed in note 8, other intangible assets and goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k.
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized.
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of operations. in projecting future taxable income, we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses. in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income/(loss). during fiscal 2020, we recorded valuation allowances of $56.5 million to reduce our deferred tax asset balance as of the beginning of the fiscal year relating to certain foreign jurisdictions not expected to generate enough future income to offset accumulated losses. absent a sustained multi-year global decline in our business in key markets such as the u.s., china and japan, we do not anticipate incurring significant additional valuation allowances against our remaining deferred tax assets as of september 27, 2020 in the next 12 months.
in addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. these audits include review of our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. we evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. for uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. we adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. as discussed in note 14, income taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k, there is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations and/or resolution of examinations with taxing authorities.
we have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and u.s. state income taxes. we regularly review our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. these plans have been unaltered as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. while we do not expect to repatriate cash to the u.s. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs, if these amounts were distributed to the u.s., in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and u.s. state income taxes, which could be material.
our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances. although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results, including forecasted covid-19 business recovery, could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.

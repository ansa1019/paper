item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" of this annual report on form 10-k. in addition to our historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, particularly in part i, item 1a, "risk factors." for a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics, see the section entitled "limitations of key metrics and other data" in this annual report on form 10-k.
certain revenue information in the section entitled "-revenue-foreign exchange impact on revenue" is presented on a constant currency basis. this information is a non-gaap financial measure. to calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the full year 2017 using 2016 monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u.s. dollar. this non-gaap financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap. this measure may be different from non-gaap financial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. we believe this non-gaap financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.
executive overview of full year 2017 results our key user metrics and financial results for 2017 are as follows:
user growth:
•   daily active users (daus) were 1.40 billion on average for december 2017, an increase of 14% year-over-year.
•   monthly active users (maus) were 2.13 billion as of december 31, 2017, an increase of 14% year-over-year.
financial results:
•   total costs and expenses were $20.45 billion.
•   net income was $15.93 billion with diluted earnings per share of $5.39.
•   capital expenditures were $6.73 billion.
•   cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $41.71 billion as of december 31, 2017.
in 2017, we continued to focus on our three main revenue growth priorities: (i) helping businesses expand their use of our mobile products, (ii) developing innovative ad products that help businesses get the most of their ad campaigns, and (iii) making our ads more relevant and effective through our targeting capabilities and outcome-based measurement.
we continued to invest, based on our roadmap, in: (i) our most developed ecosystem, the facebook app and platform as well as video, (ii) driving growth and building ecosystems around our products and features that already have significant user bases, such as instagram, messenger, and whatsapp, and (iii) long-term technology initiatives, such as connectivity, artificial intelligence, and augmented and virtual reality, that we believe will further our mission to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. we intend to continue to invest based on this roadmap and we anticipate that additional investments in the following areas will drive significant year-over-year expense growth in 2018: (i) increased investments in security, video content, and our long-term technology initiatives, and (ii) scaling our headcount and expanding our data center capacity and office facilities to support our growth.
trends in our user metrics the numbers for our key metrics, our daus, maus, and average revenue per user (arpu), do not include instagram, whatsapp, or oculus users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users, respectively, based on their other activities on facebook. in addition, other user engagement metrics do not include instagram, whatsapp, or oculus unless otherwise specifically stated.
trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. substantially all of our daily and monthly active users (as defined below) access facebook on mobile devices.
•   daily active users (daus). we define a daily active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our messenger application (and is also a registered facebook user), on a given day. we view daus, and daus as a percentage of maus, as measures of user engagement.
note: for purposes of reporting daus, maus, and arpu by geographic region, europe includes all users in russia and turkey and rest of world includes all users in africa, latin america, and the middle east.
worldwide daus increased 14% to 1.40 billion on average during december 2017 from 1.23 billion during december 2016. users in india, indonesia, and brazil represented key sources of growth in daus during december 2017, relative to the same period in 2016.
•   monthly active users (maus). we define a monthly active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our messenger application (and is also a registered facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. maus are a measure of the size of our global active user community.
as of december 31, 2017, we had 2.13 billion maus, an increase of 14% from december 31, 2016. users in india, indonesia, and vietnam represented key sources of growth in 2017, relative to the same period in 2016.
trends in our monetization by user geography we calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or virtual reality platform devices are shipped. we define arpu as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. while arpu includes all sources of revenue, the number of maus used in this calculation only includes users of facebook and messenger as described in the definition of mau above. revenue from users who are not also facebook or messenger maus was not material. the geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. our revenue and arpu in regions such as united states & canada and europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. for example, arpu in 2017 in the united states & canada region was more than nine times higher than in the asia-pacific region.
note: our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. this allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the marketer or developer.
for 2017, worldwide arpu was $20.21, an increase of 26% from 2016. over this period, arpu increased by 41% in europe, 36% in united states & canada, 33% in rest of world, and 22% in asia-pacific. in addition, user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu, such as asia-pacific and rest of world. we expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where arpu is relatively lower, such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. our actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with income taxes, loss contingencies, and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. for further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" of this annual report on form 10-k.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.
we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. we recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in tax rates in the period of the enactment. we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized.
we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. these uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. we make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.
on december 22, 2017, the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act (the tax act) was enacted into law and the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected us, including a one-time mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21% effective january 1, 2018, among others. we are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as determining the transition tax, remeasuring our u.s. deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. in december 2017, the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no. 118, income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act (sab 118), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. since the tax act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017, and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation are expected over the next 12 months, we consider the accounting of the transition tax, deferred tax re-measurements, and other items to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final year-end data and tax positions. we expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period in accordance with sab 118.
loss contingencies we are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. if we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.
we review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. we make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the estimated amount of loss.
the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected. see note 9 - commitments and contingencies and note 12 - income taxes of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" and part i, item 3, "legal proceedings" of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding these contingencies.
business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. during the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.
we review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value. as of december 31, 2017, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.
acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. we evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. the evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. if such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. we have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented.
in addition to the recoverability assessment, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets. if we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized over the revised estimated useful life.
components of results of operations revenue advertising. we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on facebook, instagram, messenger, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users. we recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. we recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. the number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. we calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action. for advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the primary obligor, we recognize revenue on a net basis.
payments and other fees. payments revenue is comprised of the net fee we receive from developers using our payments infrastructure. our other fees revenue, which has not been significant in recent periods, consists primarily of revenue from the delivery of virtual reality platform devices, and various other sources.
cost of revenue and operating expenses cost of revenue. our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. these include expenses related to the operation of our data centers, such as facility and server equipment depreciation, salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including content acquisition costs, credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, cost of virtual reality platform device inventory sold, and amortization of intangible assets.
research and development. research and development expenses consist primarily of share-based compensation, salaries, and benefits for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products. we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred.
marketing and sales. our marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries, share-based compensation, and benefits for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. our marketing and sales expenses also include marketing and promotional expenditures, professional services such as content reviewers, as well as amortization of intangible assets.
general and administrative. the majority of our general and administrative expenses consist of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for certain of our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees. in addition, general and administrative expenses include legal-related costs and professional services.

revenue year ended december 31,          2017 vs 2016         2016 vs 2015 % change
% change the most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads on mobile devices. for 2017, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 88% of total advertising revenue, as compared with approximately 83% in 2016. factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in 2017 included (i) an increase in average price per ad, (ii) an increase in users and their engagement, and (iii) an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed on mobile devices. we anticipate that advertising revenue growth will continue to be driven primarily by price rather than increases in the number and frequency of ads displayed.
in 2017 compared to 2016, the average price per ad increased by 29%, as compared with approximately 5% in 2016, and the number of ads delivered increased by 15%, as compared with approximately 50% in 2016. the increase in average price per ad was driven by an increase in demand for our ad inventory; factors contributing to this include an increase in spend from existing marketers and an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on our platform as well as the quality, relevance, and performance of those ads. the increase in the ads delivered was driven by an increase in users and their engagement and an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed on news feed, partially offset by increasing user engagement with video content and other product changes.
advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year. we believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. for instance, our advertising revenue increased 26%, 27%, and 31% between the third and fourth quarters of 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, while advertising revenue for both the first quarters of 2017 and 2016 declined 9% and 8% compared to the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively.
payments and other fees revenue in 2017 decreased $42 million, or 6%, compared to 2016. the decline in payments and other fees revenue was primarily due to decreased payments revenue from games played on personal computers, partially offset by the revenue from the delivery of virtual reality platform devices. we anticipate payments revenue will continue to decline, and such decline will be offset by increases in revenue from various other sources.
the most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in news feed. for 2016, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 83% of total advertising revenue, as compared with approximately 77% in 2015. factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in 2016 included (i) an increase in demand for our ad inventory, in part driven by an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on facebook, (ii) an increase in user growth and engagement, and (iii) an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed in news feed, as well as the quality, relevance, and performance of those ads.
in 2016 compared to 2015, the average price per ad increased by 5% and the number of ads delivered increased by 50%. the increase in average price per ad was driven by a continued mix shift towards a greater percentage of our ads being shown in news feed while the increase in the ads delivered was driven by the same factors that influenced our advertising growth.
payments and other fees revenue in 2016 decreased $96 million, or 11%, compared to 2015. the majority of the decrease in payments and other fees revenue was due to decreased payments revenue from games played on personal computers.
no customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.
foreign exchange impact on revenue the general weakening of the u.s. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 had a favorable impact on our revenue. if we had translated revenue for the full year 2017 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u.s. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $40.36 billion and $39.65 billion, respectively. using these constant rates, revenue and advertising revenue would have been $293 million and $292 million lower than actual revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the full year 2017.
the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 had an unfavorable impact on our revenue. if we had translated revenue for the full year 2016 using 2015 monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u.s. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $27.91 billion and $27.15 billion, respectively. using these constant rates, revenue and advertising revenue would have been $270 million and $269 million higher than actual revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the full year 2016.
2017                                     2016                                 2015          2017 vs 2016         2016 vs 2015 % change
% change
2017 compared to 2016. cost of revenue in 2017 increased $1.67 billion, or 44%, compared to 2016. the majority of the increase was due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure and, to a lesser extent, higher costs associated with partnership agreements, including content acquisition costs, and ads payment processing.
2016 compared to 2015. cost of revenue in 2016 increased $922 million, or 32%, compared to 2015. the majority of the increase was due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure and, to a lesser extent, higher costs associated with ads payment processing and various partnership agreements.
in 2018, we anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase as we continue to expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user growth, increased user engagement, and the delivery of new products and services and, to a lesser extent, due to higher costs associated with ads payment processing and various partnership agreements.

2017 compared to 2016. research and development expenses in 2017 increased $1.84 billion, or 31%, compared to 2016. the majority of the increase was due to an increase in payroll and benefits as a result of a 49% growth in employee headcount from december 31, 2016 to december 31, 2017 in engineering and other technical functions, partially offset by a $262 million decrease in share-based compensation related to the acquisitions completed in 2014.
2016 compared to 2015. research and development expenses in 2016 increased $1.10 billion, or 23%, compared to 2015. the majority of the increase was due to an increase in payroll and benefits as a result of a 34% growth in employee headcount from december 31, 2015 to december 31, 2016 in engineering and other technical functions. additionally, our equipment and related expenses in 2016 to support our research and development efforts increased $170 million compared to 2015.
in 2018, we plan to continue to hire software engineers and other technical employees, and to increase our investment to support our research and development initiatives.

2017 compared to 2016. general and administrative expenses in 2017 increased $786 million, or 45%, compared to 2016. the majority of the increase was due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 58% increase in employee headcount from december 31, 2016 to december 31, 2017 in general and administrative functions, and to a lesser extent, higher legal-related costs.
2016 compared to 2015. general and administrative expenses in 2016 increased $436 million, or 34%, compared to 2015. the majority of the increase was due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 43% increase in employee headcount from december 31, 2015 to december 31, 2016 in general and administrative functions, and to a lesser extent, higher professional services and legal fees.
in 2018, we plan to continue to increase general and administrative expenses to support overall company growth.

2017 compared to 2016. interest and other income, net in 2017 increased $300 million compared to 2016. the majority of the increase in 2017 was due to an increase in interest income driven by higher invested cash balances and interest rates. in addition, foreign exchange impact resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency assets and liabilities also contributed to the increase in 2017.
2016 compared to 2015. interest and other income (expense), net in 2016 increased $122 million compared to 2015. interest income, net increased mostly due to increases in interest income driven by higher invested cash balances and interest rates. in addition, the majority of the increase in other expense, net was due to foreign exchange impact resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency assets and liabilities.

2017 compared to 2016. our provision for income taxes in 2017 increased $2.36 billion, or 103%, compared to 2016, mostly due to the effects of the tax act that was enacted on december 22, 2017 and an increase in income before provision for income taxes, partially offset by an increase in excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation. as a result of the tax act, we recognized a one-time mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings, remeasured our u.s. deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reassessed the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, which increased our provision for income taxes in 2017 by $2.27 billion.
our effective tax rate in 2017 increased compared to 2016, mostly due to the tax act and a decrease in the tax rate benefit from share-based compensation compared to 2016. these effects were partially offset by an increase in income before provision for income taxes being earned in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the u.s. statutory tax rate. in 2017, excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by $1.25 billion and our effective tax rate by six percentage points as compared to the tax rate without such benefits. for comparison, in 2016, excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by $934 million and our effective tax rate by seven percentage points, as compared to the tax rate without such benefits.
2016 compared to 2015. our provision for income taxes in 2016 decreased $205 million, or 8%, compared to 2015, primarily due to recognition of excess tax benefits from share-based compensation in our provision for income taxes resulting from the adoption of asu 2016-09, partially offset by an increase in income before provision for income taxes. our effective tax rate in 2016 decreased compared to 2015 due to more of our income before provision for income taxes being earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the u.s. statutory rate where we had asserted our intention to indefinitely reinvest certain of those earnings, as well as due to a lower increase in our unrecognized tax benefit in 2016 compared to 2015 and the adoption of asu 2016-09 in 2016.
effective tax rate items. our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion of our income before provision for income taxes earned in the united states and in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the u.s. statutory rate, as well as a number of other factors, including excess tax benefits from share-based compensation, changes to our provisional accounting for the effects of the tax act during the measurement period, tax effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the impact of new legislation.
the portion of our income before provision for income taxes earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the u.s. statutory rate will depend upon the proportion of revenue and costs associated with the respective jurisdictions.
integrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions that have the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes. consequently, our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition and integration. the magnitude of this impact will depend upon the specific type, size, and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well as the relative contribution to income in subsequent periods.
the accounting for share-based compensation will increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return which depends upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting.
absent unanticipated events and unexpected effects of the tax act, we anticipate our effective tax rate in 2018 will be lower than it was in 2017. our 2017 effective tax rate was significantly affected by the tax act. in addition, since we recognize excess tax benefits on a discrete basis, we anticipate that our effective tax rate will vary from quarter to quarter depending on our stock price in each period. if our stock price remains constant to the january 31, 2018 price, we anticipate that our effective tax rate will be lower in the first quarter of 2018 and increase in the remaining quarters throughout the year.
unrecognized tax benefits. as of december 31, 2017, we had net unrecognized tax benefits of $2.75 billion which were accrued as other liabilities. these unrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued for uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which includes licensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions, as well as for uncertainties with our research tax credits. the ultimate settlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits, litigation, or events that would otherwise change the assessment of such items. based upon the status of litigation described below and the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions, we do not anticipate a significant impact to such amounts within the next 12 months.
in july 2016, we received a statutory notice of deficiency (notice) from the irs related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. while the notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the irs states that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010, which, if the irs prevails in its position, could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated aggregate amount of approximately $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed u.s. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted. we do not agree with the position of the irs and have filed a petition in the united states tax court challenging the notice. we have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in asc 740 that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability of $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed u.s. return, plus interest and penalties. if the irs prevails in the assessment of additional tax due based on its position, the assessed tax, interest and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. as of december 31, 2017, we have not resolved this matter and proceedings continue in the united states tax court. we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations.
we expect to continue to accrue unrecognized tax benefits for certain recurring tax positions and anticipate that the amount for future quarters accrued will be similar to amounts accrued in 2017. absent unanticipated events, we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits will have a significant impact on our effective tax rate in 2018.

liquidity and capital resources year ended december 31, consolidated statements of cash flows data:
net cash provided by operating activities       $24,216               $16,108               $10,320
net cash used in investing activities           (20,038    )          (11,739    )           (9,434    )

our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, and investments in u.s. government securities, u.s. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $41.71 billion as of december 31, 2017, an increase of $12.26 billion from december 31, 2016, mostly due to $24.22 billion of cash generated from operations, partially offset by $6.73 billion for purchases of property and equipment, $3.25 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, and $1.98 billion for repurchases of our class a common stock.
cash paid for income taxes (net of refunds) was $2.12 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017. we recorded a provisional tax liability of $2.9 billion relating to the one-time mandatory transition tax on our accumulated foreign earnings which we intend to pay over an eight-year payment schedule as prescribed by the tax act.
in may 2016, we entered into a $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, and any amounts outstanding under the facility will be due and payable on may 20, 2021. as of december 31, 2017, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility.
in november 2016, our board of directors authorized a $6.0 billion share repurchase program of our class a common stock that commenced in 2017 and does not have an expiration date. the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities, and shares may be repurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under rule 10b5-1 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. during 2017, we repurchased and subsequently retired approximately 13 million shares of our class a common stock for an aggregate amount of approximately $2.07 billion.
in january 2017, we began funding withholding taxes due on employee equity awards by net share settlement, rather than our previous approach of requiring employees to sell shares of our common stock to cover taxes upon vesting of such awards. in 2017, we paid $3.25 billion of taxes related to the net share settlement of equity awards.
as of december 31, 2017, $15.89 billion of the $41.71 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. the tax act imposes a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and eliminates u.s. taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions. as a result, earnings in foreign jurisdictions are available for distribution to the u.s. without incremental u.s. taxes.
we currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facility, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future.
cash provided by operating activities cash flow from operating activities during 2017 mostly consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expense of $3.72 billion and total depreciation and amortization of $3.03 billion. the increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2017 compared to 2016, was mostly due to an increase in net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation expense. due to the enactment of the tax act in 2017, we recorded a provisional tax liability of $2.9 billion relating to the one-time mandatory transition tax on our accumulated foreign earnings,which also contributed to the increase in 2017 compared to 2016.
cash flow from operating activities during 2016 mostly consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expense of $3.22 billion and total depreciation and amortization of $2.34 billion. the increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2016 compared to 2015, was mostly due to an increase in net income, including the impact of asu 2016-09 adoption, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, and share-based compensation expense.
cash flow from operating activities during 2015 mostly consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expense of $2.96 billion, total depreciation and amortization of $1.95 billion, and tax benefit from share-based award activity of $1.72 billion, which had been reclassified from financing activity as a result of asu 2016-09 adoption. the increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2015 compared to 2014, was primarily due to an increase in net income, as adjusted for share-based compensation expense, and higher income tax payable as of december 31, 2015 compared to 2014.
cash used in investing activities cash used in investing activities during 2017 mostly resulted from $13.25 billion for net purchases of marketable securities and $6.73 billion for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, office buildings, and network infrastructure. the increase in cash used in investing activities during 2017 compared to 2016 was due to increases in net purchases of marketable securities and capital expenditures.
cash used in investing activities during 2016 mostly resulted from $7.19 billion for net purchases of marketable securities and $4.49 billion for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in data centers, servers, office buildings, and network infrastructure. the increase in cash used in investing activities during 2016 compared to 2015 was mostly due to increases in capital expenditures and net purchases of marketable securities.
cash used in investing activities during 2015 primarily resulted from $6.70 billion for net purchases of marketable securities and $2.52 billion for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, network infrastructure, and office buildings. the increase in cash used in investing activities during 2015 compared to 2014 was mainly due to increases in net purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by a decrease in acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets.
we anticipate making capital expenditures in 2018 of approximately $14.0 billion to $15.0 billion.
cash used in financing activities cash used in financing activities during 2017 mostly consisted of $3.25 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, and $1.98 billion paid for repurchases of our class a common stock. the increase in cash used in financing activities during 2017 compared to 2016 was mostly due to taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards and repurchases of our class a common stock that commenced in 2017.
cash used in financing activities during 2016 mostly consisted of principal payments on capital lease and other financing obligations. the increase in cash used in financing activities was due to full repayment of our capital lease and other financing obligations in 2016.
cash used in financing activities during 2015 primarily consisted of principal payments on capital lease obligations. the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to lower principal payments related to our capital lease transactions.
contractual obligations our principal commitments consist of obligations under operating leases for offices, land, facilities, colocations, and data centers, as well as contractual commitments related to network infrastructure and data center operations. the following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of december 31, 2017 (in millions):
financing obligation - building in progress - leased facility(1)         195       -                            16                  30                 149
other contractual commitments(2)                                       2,953       1,830                       346                 100                 677
(1)   financing obligation - building in progress - leased facility represents our commitments to lease certain office buildings that are currently under construction. as of december 31, 2017, $72 million of the total obligation was recorded as a liability and is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. see note 9 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this financing obligation.
(2)   other contractual commitments primarily relate to network infrastructure and our data center operations.
as part of the normal course of the business, we may enter into multi-year agreements to purchase certain network components that do not specify a fixed or minimum price commitment or to purchase renewable energy that do not specify a fixed or minimum volume commitment. these agreements are generally entered into in order to secure either volume or price. using projected market prices or expected volume consumption, the total estimated spend is approximately $4.0 billion. the ultimate spend under these agreements may vary and will be based on prevailing market prices or actual volume purchased.
in addition, our other liabilities include $2.75 billion related to uncertain tax positions as of december 31, 2017. due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months. as a result, this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table.
contingencies we are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. if we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss. such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
see note 9 - commitments and contingencies and note 12 - income taxes of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" and part i, item 3, "legal proceedings" of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding these contingencies.
recently issued accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) (asu 2014-09), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. in august 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-14, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): deferral of the effective date, which delays the effective date of asu 2014-09 by one year. the fasb also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. in march 2016, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2016-08, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): principal versus agent considerations (reporting revenue gross versus net) (asu 2016-08) which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. the guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customers. the new standard further requires new disclosures about contracts with customers, including the significant judgments the company has made when applying the guidance. we will adopt the new standard effective january 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method. we finalized our analysis and the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and our internal controls over financial reporting.
in february 2016, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2016-02, leases (topic 842) (asu 2016-02), which generally requires companies to recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet. this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2019 on a modified retrospective basis and early adoption is permitted. we will adopt the new standard effective january 1, 2019. we have selected a lease accounting system and we are in the process of implementing such system as well as evaluating the use of the optional practical expedients. while we continue to evaluate the effect of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, we expect our operating leases, as disclosed in note 9 - commitments and contingencies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" of this annual report on form 10-k, will be subject to the new standard. we will recognize right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets upon adoption, which will increase our total assets and liabilities.
in october 2016, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2016-16, income taxes (topic 740): intra-entity transfers other than inventory (asu 2016-16), which requires companies to recognize the income-tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs, rather than when the asset has been sold to an outside party. we will adopt the new standard effective january 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. a cumulative-effect adjustment will capture the write-off of income tax consequences deferred from past intra-entity transfers involving assets other than inventory, new deferred tax assets, and other liabilities for amounts not currently recognized under u.s. gaap. based on transactions up to december 31, 2017, we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in november 2016, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2016-18, statement of cash flows (topic 230): restricted cash (asu 2016-18), which requires companies to include amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in cash and cash equivalents when reconciling beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. we will adopt the new standard effective january 1, 2018, using the retrospective transition approach for all periods presented. we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in january 2017, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2017-01, business combinations (topic 805): clarifying the definition of a business (asu 2017-01), which revises the definition of a business and provides new guidance in evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business. we will adopt the new standard effective january 1, 2018, on a prospective basis and do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in january 2017, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2017-04, intangibles - goodwill and other (topic 350): simplifying the test for goodwill impairment (asu 2017-04), which eliminates step two from the goodwill impairment test. under asu 2017-04, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2020 on a prospective basis, and early adoption is permitted. we do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

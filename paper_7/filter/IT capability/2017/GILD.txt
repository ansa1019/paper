2017 business highlights
2017 was marked by operational excellence across our business, as we accomplished many key goals that position us for future growth. during 2017, we observed strong performance in our hiv and cardiovascular products. we continued to execute on and maximize the opportunity in hcv in a changing competitive landscape. in addition, we continued to advance our product pipeline across our therapeutic areas with the goal of delivering best-in-class drugs that advance the current standard of care and/or address unmet medical need. recent key developments include:
•   fda granted priority review for our new drug application (nda) for biktarvy, our fixed-dose combination of bictegravir (bic), a novel investigational integrase strand transfer inhibitor, and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (taf), for the treatment of hiv-1 infection. in addition, our marketing authorization application for biktarvy has been fully validated and is now under evaluation by the european medicines agency (ema). we received u.s. food and drug administration (fda) approval for biktarvy on february 7, 2018.
•   european commission granted marketing authorization for vemlidy, a once-daily tablet for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection in adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older with body weight at least 35 kg).
•   european commission and fda approved vosevi, a once-daily single tablet regimen for the treatment of hcv infection in adults with genotype 1-6. vosevi is the first and only single tablet regimen for patients who have previously failed therapy with direct-acting antiviral (daa) treatments and is the latest regimen in our portfolio of sofosbuvir-based hcv daa treatments.
•   we announced a new licensing agreement with the medicines patent pool (mpp), a united nations-backed public health organization, to expand access to bic. through this agreement, mpp can sub-license rights to bic to generic drug companies in india, china and south africa to manufacture therapies containing bic for distribution in certain low- and middle-income countries.
•   china food and drug administration approved sovaldi for the treatment of hcv infection. sovaldi was approved for the treatment of adults and adolescents (aged 12 to 18 years) infected with hcv genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 as a component of a combination antiviral treatment regimen. sovaldi is our first hcv medicine approved in china.
•   fda approved expanded labeling for epclusa, the first all-oral, pan-genotypic, once-daily single tablet regimen for the treatment of adults with hcv infection, to include use in patients co-infected with hiv.
•   european commission extended marketing authorization for harvoni to include the treatment of hcv infection in adolescents infected with genotype 1, 3, 4, 5 or 6. harvoni is the first daa regimen to receive marketing authorization in the european union extended for use in the adolescent population.
•   fda approved supplemental indications for harvoni and sovaldi for the treatment of hcv infection in adolescents without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, 12 years of age and older, or weighing at least 35 kilograms. harvoni was approved for pediatric patients with genotype 1, 4, 5 or 6 hcv infection. sovaldi was approved for pediatric patients with genotype 2 or 3 hcv infection, in combination with ribavirin.
acquisitions
•   in october 2017, we completed a tender offer for all of the outstanding common stock of kite pharma, inc. (kite) for $180 per share in cash, or approximately $11.2 billion, excluding approximately $0.7 billion relating to the portion of the replaced stock-based awards attributable to the post combination period. we financed the transaction with $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount in senior unsecured notes issued in september 2017, a $6.0 billion aggregate principal amount term loan facility credit agreement entered into in september 2017 and drawn in october 2017, of which $1.5 billion was repaid in december 2017, as well as cash on hand. kite's cell therapies express either a chimeric antigen receptor (car) or an engineered t cell receptor, depending on the type of cancer. the acquisition resulted in kite becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary and established us as a leader in cellular therapy.
through the kite acquisition, we acquired axicabtagene ciloleucel, a car t cell therapy. in october 2017, we received approval from fda for axicabtagene ciloleucel, now known commercially as yescarta, making it the first car t cell therapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large b-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy, which includes diffuse large b-cell lymphoma, transformed follicular lymphoma and primary mediastinal b-cell lymphoma. we have also filed a marketing authorization application for axicabtagene ciloleucel for the treatment of the same indications with ema, representing the first known submission in europe for a car t cell therapy. approval in europe is expected in the first half of 2018, although there can be no assurance that we will receive such approval on a timely basis or at all. in addition to axicabtagene ciloleucel, we also acquired therapy candidates in clinical trials in both hematologic cancers and solid tumors, including kite-585, a car t cell therapy candidate that targets b-cell maturation antigen expressed in multiple myeloma.
•   in december 2017, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of cell design labs, inc. (cell design labs), a privately held company, which was in addition to the approximately 12.2% of shares in cell design labs we obtained in the acquisition of kite. with this acquisition, we gained new technology platforms that will enhance research and development efforts in cellular therapy.
see note 5, acquisitions of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding the acquisition of kite and cell design labs.
2017 financial highlights during 2017, total revenues decreased to $26.1 billion and total product sales decreased to $25.7 billion, compared to $30.4 billion and $30.0 billion in 2016, respectively, primarily due to the competitive dynamics of the hcv market, which lowered sales of our hcv products, partially offset by higher sales of our hiv products. in the united states, product sales were $18.1 billion in 2017, compared to $19.3 billion in 2016. in europe, product sales were $5.0 billion in 2017, compared to $6.1 billion in 2016. sales in other international locations were $2.6 billion in 2017, compared to $4.6 billion in 2016.
research and development (r&d) expenses decreased 27% to $3.7 billion for 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to the 2016 impacts of business development activities resulting in up-front collaboration expense related to our license and collaboration agreement with galapagos nv (galapagos) and acquired in-process r&d (ipr&d) expense related to our purchase of nimbus apollo, inc. (nimbus), ipr&d impairment charges and ongoing milestone payments, partially offset by acquired ipr&d expense related to our purchase of cell design labs in 2017.
selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses increased 14% to $3.9 billion for 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to costs associated with our acquisition of kite and higher branded drug prescription (bpd) fee expense.
provision for income taxes increased to $8.9 billion for 2017 compared to $3.6 billion in 2016, primarily due to an estimated $5.5 billion net charge related to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act (tax reform) in the fourth quarter of 2017.
net income attributable to gilead for 2017 was $4.6 billion or $3.51 per diluted share, compared to $13.5 billion or $9.94 per diluted share in 2016, primarily due to lower product sales and the impact from tax reform.
as of december 31, 2017, we had $36.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities compared to $32.4 billion as of december 31, 2016. during 2017, we generated $11.9 billion in operating cash flow, paid cash dividends of $2.7 billion and repurchased a total of 13 million shares for $954 million through open market transactions.
in 2018, we will continue to maintain our strong focus on operational excellence and financial discipline. from a r&d perspective, we will continue to invest in new and ongoing clinical studies, which support both our existing products and our product candidates. we expect to move forward on a number of clinical studies for new product candidates, including advancing our cell therapy pipeline and continuing the progression of our phase 3 studies of selonsertib for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (nash) and filgotinib for rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. in order to further develop our product pipeline, we will focus on leveraging our balance sheet to pursue partnering and acquisition opportunities which fit into our long-term strategic plan.
from a commercial perspective, we will support the launch of biktarvy and continue to promote the use of our existing taf-containing regimens. in addition, we believe truvada for pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) will continue to be an integral part of our growth in hiv in the united states as communities embrace the public health benefits of prevention. in hcv, we expect a decline in product sales in all major markets as a result of increased competition. hcv revenues are driven by four variables: patient starts, net pricing, market share and treatment duration. treatment duration has stabilized as a variable and pricing of all regimens has gravitated towards the 8-week regimen price. we anticipate both pricing and market share to stabilize by mid-2018 with more predictable, but slightly declining, patient starts moving forward. in cell therapy, we will continue to promote the use of yescarta in the united states and prepare for anticipated approval in europe.
we will continue to help ensure patient access to our products around the world, including through our gilead access program, under which more than 10 million people receive our hiv medicines in low- and middle-income countries.
our progress on all of these initiatives is subject to a number of uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the continuation of an uncertain global macroeconomic environment; additional pricing pressures from payers and competitors; slower than anticipated growth in our hiv products; an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers; market share and price erosion caused by the introduction of generic versions of truvada outside the united states and viread and letairis in the united states; inaccuracies in our hcv patient start estimates; potential amendments to the affordable care act or other government action that could have the effect of lowering prices; a larger than anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segment; and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
2017 results of operations total revenues the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales and royalty, contract and other revenues:
(in millions, except percentages)                   2017         change                2016      change                2015
antiviral product sales, which include sales of our hiv, hbv and hcv products, were $23.3 billion in 2017, compared to $27.7 billion in 2016. hiv and hbv product sales were $14.2 billion in 2017, compared to $12.9 billion in 2016. the increase was primarily driven by the continued uptake of our taf-based products, partially offset by decreases in sales of tenofovir disoproxil (tdf)-based products. hcv product sales, which consist of harvoni, epclusa, sovaldi and vosevi, were $9.1 billion in 2017, compared to $14.8 billion in 2016. the declines of our hcv product sales across all major markets were a result of increased competition and lower total market patient starts.
other product sales, which include sales of letairis, ranexa and ambisome, were $2.3 billion in 2017, an increase of 5% compared to $2.2 billion in 2016. letairis is expected to face generic competition in the united states starting in july 2018.
of our product sales in 2017, 29% were generated outside the united states. we faced exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in the euro. we used foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a percentage of our foreign currency exposure. foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $117 million on our 2017 product sales compared to 2016.
we record product sales net of estimated mandatory and supplemental discounts to government payers, in addition to discounts to private payers, including rebates, chargebacks, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and other related costs. these deductions are generally referred to as gross-to-net deductions and totaled $17.2 billion or 40% of gross product sales in 2017, compared to $20.3 billion or 40% in 2016. of the $17.2 billion in 2017, $15.5 billion or 36% of gross product sales was related to government and other rebates and chargebacks, and $1.7 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and other related costs.
product sales in the united states decreased by 6% to $18.1 billion in 2017, compared to $19.3 billion in 2016. declines in sales of our hcv products were partially offset by increases in sales of our hiv and hbv products. the declines in sales of our hcv products were primarily due to lower harvoni and sovaldi sales volume as a result of increased competition and lower total market patient starts. additionally, increases in epclusa and vosevi sales volume were partially offset by lower average net selling price for epclusa as pricing of all regimens has gravitated towards the 8-week regimen price. the increases in the sales of our hiv and hbv products were primarily driven by higher sales volume of our taf-based products and higher average net selling prices, partially offset by decreases in our tdf-based products and the prior year impact of a favorable revision to our rebate reserves of $332 million, primarily related to our tdf-based products.
product sales in europe decreased by 18% to $5.0 billion in 2017, compared to $6.1 billion in 2016, primarily due to lower harvoni and sovaldi sales volume, partially offset by higher epclusa sales volume. foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $89 million on our product sales in 2017 compared to 2016.
product sales in other international locations decreased by 45% to $2.6 billion in 2017, compared to $4.6 billion in 2016, primarily due to lower sales in japan. sales of our hcv products in japan were $692 million for 2017, compared to $2.5 billion for the same period in 2016, primarily due to lower sales volume as a result of lower total market patient starts and increased competition.
of our product sales in 2016, 36% were generated outside the united states. foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $498 million on our 2016 product sales compared to 2015.
our gross-to-net deductions totaled $20.3 billion or 40% of gross product sales in 2016, compared to $18.1 billion or 36% in 2015. of the $20.3 billion in 2016, $19.1 billion or 38% of gross product sales was related to government and other rebates and chargebacks, and $1.2 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and other related costs. the increase in our 2016 gross-to-net deductions was primarily due to an increase in discounts and a higher percentage of sales to more deeply discounted segments for our hcv products in the united states.
product sales in the united states decreased by 9% to $19.3 billion in 2016, compared to $21.2 billion in 2015. declines in sales of our hcv products were partially offset by increases in sales of our hiv and hbv products. the increases in the sales of our hiv and hbv products were primarily driven by sales of our newly launched taf-based products and a favorable revision to our rebate reserves of $332 million, primarily related to our tdf-based products.
product sales in europe decreased by 15% to $6.1 billion in 2016, compared to $7.2 billion in 2015, primarily due to lower harvoni and sovaldi sales volume. foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact of $503 million on our product sales in 2016 compared to 2015.
product sales in other international locations increased by 20% to $4.6 billion in 2016, compared to $3.8 billion in 2015, primarily due to sales in japan. sales of our hcv products in japan were $2.5 billion for 2016, compared to $1.9 billion in 2015. the increase was primarily driven by higher sales volume of harvoni, which was launched in september 2015, partially offset by a mandatory price reduction of 32% for sovaldi and harvoni that was effective april 1, 2016.
the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales:
(in millions, except percentages)                2017          change                2016          change                2015
* percentage not meaningful the following is additional discussion of our results by product:
•   harvoni harvoni sales accounted for 19%, 33% and 46% of our total antiviral product sales for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. in 2017, product sales were $3.1 billion in the united states, $704 million in europe and $613 million in other international locations. in 2016, product sales were $4.9 billion in the united states, $1.8 billion in europe and $2.3 billion in other international locations. in 2015, product sales were $10.1 billion in the united states, $2.2 billion in europe and $1.6 billion in other international locations.
the decreases in 2017 compared to 2016 in all major markets were primarily due to lower sales volume.
in the united states, the decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower sales volume and a lower average net selling price, which was partially offset by a favorable revision to our sales return reserve of $181 million recorded during the second quarter of 2016. the number of patients that started treatment with harvoni in the united states peaked in the first half of 2015, as many warehoused patients initiated treatment after the product launch. in europe, the decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower sales volume and unfavorable foreign currency exchange, net of hedges. in other international locations, the increase in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to higher sales in japan. sales in japan were $1.8 billion in 2016 compared to $1.0 billion in 2015, driven by higher sales volume, partially offset by a mandatory price reduction of 32% that was effective april 1, 2016.
epclusa sales accounted for 15% and 6% of our total antiviral product sales for 2017 and 2016, respectively. in 2017, product sales were $2.4 billion in the united states, $869 million in europe and $237 million in other international locations. in 2016, product sales were $1.6 billion in the united states, $141 million in europe and $20 million in other international locations.
the increases in 2017 compared to 2016 in all major markets were primarily due to higher sales volume, partially offset by a decrease in average net selling price.
•   sovaldi sovaldi sales accounted for 4%, 14% and 17% of our total antiviral product sales for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. in 2017, product sales were $130 million in the united states, $258 million in europe and $576 million in other international locations. in 2016, product sales were $1.9 billion in the united states, $891 million in europe and $1.2 billion in other international locations. in 2015, product sales were $2.4 billion in the united states, $1.6 billion in europe and $1.3 billion in other international locations.
the decreases in 2017 compared to 2016 in all major markets were primarily due to lower sales volume driven by a shift in the market from sovaldi to epclusa.
in the united states, the decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by a favorable revision to our sales return reserve of $98 million recorded during the second quarter of 2016. in europe, the decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower sales volume. in other international locations, the slight decrease was primarily due to lower sales in japan. sales in japan were $635 million in 2016 compared to $878 million in 2015 due to a mandatory price reduction of 32% that was effective april 1, 2016 and lower sales volume.
product sales of these taf-based regimens were $6.0 billion, $2.1 billion and $45 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and accounted for 26% and 8% of our total antiviral product sales for 2017 and 2016, respectively. in 2017, product sales were $5.0 billion in the united states, $892 million in europe and $151 million in other international locations. in 2016, product sales were $1.8 billion in the united states, $256 million in europe and $26 million in other international locations.
the increases in 2017 compared to 2016 in all major markets were primarily driven by higher sales volume as patients shifted away from tdf-based regimens. in europe, product sales of our taf-based regimens continue to grow despite the availability of generic viread and truvada in several countries.
•   tdf-based regimens - stribild, complera/eviplera, atripla, truvada and viread product sales of these tdf-based regimens were $8.0 billion, $10.7 billion and $11.0 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and accounted for 34%, 39% and 36% of our total antiviral product sales for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. in 2017, product sales were $5.3 billion in the united states, $1.9 billion in europe and $805 million in other international locations. in 2016, product sales were $7.2 billion in the united states, $2.6 billion in europe and $882 million in other international locations. in 2015, product sales were $7.1 billion in the united states, $3.0 billion in europe and $881 million in other international locations.
in the united states, the decreases in 2017 compared to 2016 were primarily due to lower sales volume as a result of the continued uptake of our taf-based regimens, partially offset by the increased usage of truvada for prep. in europe, the decreases in 2017 compared to 2016 were primarily due to lower sales volume as a result of the availability of generic viread and truvada in several countries and the continued uptake of our taf-based regimens.
in the united states, the increases in 2016 compared to 2015 were primarily due to a favorable revision to our rebate reserves of $312 million relating to stribild and complera in the third quarter of 2016. in europe, the decreases in 2016 compared to 2015 were primarily due to lower sales volume as a result of the continued uptake of our taf-based regimens.
royalty, contract and other revenues the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty, contract and other revenues:
(in millions, except percentages)      2017                 change      2016              change      2015
royalty, contract and other revenues in 2017 were up slightly compared to the same period in 2016, and decreased by 10% in 2016, compared to $488 million in 2015. the decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to royalty revenues from f. hoffman-la roche ltd for sales of tamiflu.
cost of goods sold and product gross margin the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales, cost of goods sold and product gross margin:
(in millions, except percentages)                2017         change                2016         change                2015
the decreases in our product gross margin in 2017 compared to 2016 and in 2016 compared to 2015 were primarily due to changes in product mix, as our hcv product sales decreased as a percentage of total product sales.
research and development expenses the following table summarizes the period over period changes in r&d expenses:
(in millions, except percentages)   2017                change      2016                    change      2015
r&d expenses summarized above consisted primarily of clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, materials and supplies, licenses and fees, up-front payments under collaboration agreements, milestone payments, personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities-related costs.
we do not track total r&d expenses by product candidate, therapeutic area or development phase. however, we manage our r&d expenses by identifying the r&d activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources and other considerations. we continually review our r&d pipeline and the status of development and, as necessary, reallocate resources among the r&d portfolio that we believe will best support the future growth of our business.
personnel and infrastructure expenses           1,271               1,122               1,041
facilities, it and other costs                    360                 325                 339
in 2017, r&d expenses decreased $1.4 billion or 27%, compared to 2016, primarily due to the 2016 impacts of business development activities resulting in up-front collaboration expense related to our license and collaboration agreement with galapagos and acquired ipr&d expense related to our purchase of nimbus, ipr&d impairment charges and ongoing milestone payments, partially offset by acquired ipr&d expense related to our purchase of cell design labs in 2017.
in 2016, r&d expenses increased $2.1 billion or 69%, compared to 2015, primarily due to the overall progression of clinical studies, including ongoing milestone payments, our purchase of an fda priority review voucher, up-front collaboration expenses related to our license and collaboration agreement with galapagos and acquired ipr&d expense related to our purchase of nimbus. ipr&d impairment charges were a result of termination of clinical development for momelotinib and simtuzumab.
selling, general and administrative expenses the following table summarizes the period over period changes in sg&a expenses:
(in millions, except percentages)   2017                    change      2016                change      2015
sg&a expenses relate to sales and marketing, finance, human resources, legal and other administrative activities. expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, facilities and overhead costs, outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses, and other general and administrative costs. sg&a expenses also include the bpd fee. in the united states, we, along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded drug products, are required to pay a portion of the bpd fee, which is estimated based on select government sales during each calendar year as a percentage of total industry government sales and is trued-up upon receipt of invoices from the internal revenue service (irs).
in 2017, sg&a expenses increased $480 million or 14% compared to 2016, primarily due to costs associated with our acquisition of kite, which primarily consist of stock-based compensation and transaction costs, as well as higher bpd fee expenses resulting from a favorable adjustment of $191 million in the first quarter of 2016.
in 2016, sg&a expenses were flat compared to 2015. declines in our bpd fee expenses were offset by higher costs to support new product launches and our geographic expansion. the 2016 bpd fee expenses were favorably impacted by a credit of $191 million based on our receipt of the irs invoice.
other income (expense), net other income (expense), net, was $523 million, $428 million and $154 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the increases were primarily due to our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities earning a higher yield and higher cash balances.
provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes was $8.9 billion in 2017 compared to $3.6 billion in 2016. the 2017 effective tax rate increased to 65.7% from the 2016 effective tax rate of 21.1%, primarily due to the enactment of tax reform in december 2017. changes to the geographic mix of earnings also contributed to the increase in the 2017 effective tax rate.
on december 22, 2017, tax reform was signed into law in the united states making significant changes to the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended. changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after december 31, 2017, implementation of a modified territorial tax system and a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. we calculated a provisional estimate of the impact from tax reform in our 2017 income tax provision in accordance with our interpretation of tax reform and guidance available as of the date of this filing. as a result, we recorded an estimated $5.5 billion net charge to income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which tax reform was enacted. this amount includes: i) a provisional $308 million deferred tax benefit related to the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on the revised rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, and ii) a provisional $5.8 billion charge related to the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings determined as of december 31, 2017. the provisional transition tax charge includes federal (net of certain offsetting adjustments related to unrecognized tax benefits), state and local, and foreign withholding tax on the accumulated foreign earnings, which are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested as of december 31, 2017.
the accrued federal liability for the transition tax of $6.1 billion will be payable over an eight year period. as of december 31, 2017, $487 million of the transition tax was recorded within other accrued liabilities and $5.6 billion was recorded in long-term income taxes payable on our consolidated balance sheets.
in accordance with the u.s. securities and exchange commission (sec) staff accounting bulletin no. 118 (sab 118), we have determined that the $308 million of the deferred tax benefit recorded in connection with the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities and the $5.8 billion of current tax expense recorded in connection with the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings are provisional and subject to further adjustment during the measurement period (not to exceed one year from the enactment of tax reform). given the complexity of tax reform, we may be refining our estimates of these provisional amounts as further guidance is issued from the u.s. treasury, the sec and the financial accounting standards board (fasb).
additionally, we are continuing to evaluate the accounting policy election required with regard to the tax on global intangible low-taxed income (the global minimum tax). the fasb allows companies to adopt a policy election to account for the global minimum tax under one of two methods: (i) account for the global minimum tax as a component of tax expense in the period in which a company is subject to the rules (the period cost method), or (ii) account for the global minimum tax in a company's measurement of deferred taxes (the deferred method). we have not elected a method and will only do so after our completion of the analysis of the global minimum tax provisions. our election method will depend, in part, on analyzing expected future u.s. taxable income inclusions related to global minimum tax under both methodologies in order to determine the most appropriate method. should we decide to elect the deferred method of accounting for the global minimum tax, it is possible that our provisional estimate for re-measuring our deferred taxes may materially change. we will finalize the analysis for the accounting policy election during the measurement period.
our provision for income taxes was $3.6 billion in both 2016 and 2015. the effective tax rate increased to 21.1% in 2016 from 16.4% in 2015 primarily due to changes in the geographic mix of earnings.
liquidity and capital resources we believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by our cash flows generated from operating activities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. the following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and working capital (in millions):
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities            $36,694             $32,380             $26,208
working capital                                             $20,188             $10,370             $14,044
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $36.7 billion at december 31, 2017, an increase of $4.3 billion or 13% when compared to $32.4 billion at december 31, 2016. during 2017, we generated $11.9 billion in operating cash flow and in connection with our acquisition of kite, we issued $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and entered into and drew on a $6.0 billion aggregate principal amount term loan facility credit agreement, of which $1.5 billion was repaid in december 2017. additionally, we paid cash dividends of $2.7 billion and utilized $954 million on stock repurchases. see note 5, acquisitions of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional details on our acquisition of kite.
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $32.4 billion at december 31, 2016, an increase of $6.2 billion or 24% when compared to $26.2 billion at december 31, 2015. during 2016, we generated $17.0 billion in operating cash flow, received $4.9 billion in net proceeds from the 2016 notes, utilized $11.0 billion to repurchase stock, repaid $985 million principal balance of our senior notes and convertible senior notes and paid cash dividends of $2.5 billion.
of the total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at december 31, 2017, approximately $31.5 billion was generated from operations in foreign jurisdictions. in february 2018, we repatriated $28.0 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to our parent company headquartered in the united states. prior to the enactment of tax reform, these earnings were considered indefinitely reinvested and no u.s. taxes had been provided. in 2017, u.s. taxes have been provided on these earnings through the accrual of the tax reform transition tax. see note 17, income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional details on tax reform.
working capital working capital was $20.2 billion at december 31, 2017. the increase of $9.8 billion from working capital at december 31, 2016 was primarily driven by an increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities resulting from a shift in the duration of our marketable securities portfolio to reduce interest rate risk, partially offset by $2.7 billion increase in current portion of long-term debt based on contractual maturity.
working capital was $10.4 billion at december 31, 2016. the decrease of $3.7 billion from working capital at december 31, 2015 was primarily due to a decline in cash and cash equivalents, as a result of an increase in our long-term marketable securities.
cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flow activities (in millions):
operating activities                    $11,898           $17,047               $21,250
investing activities                   $(16,069   )       $(11,985      )       $(12,475      )
financing activities                     $3,393           $(9,725       )       $(5,884       )
cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our net income for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. cash provided by operating activities decreased by $5.1 billion to $11.9 billion in 2017 when compared to 2016, primarily due to lower cash receipts as a result of lower product sales and higher tax payments.
cash provided by operating activities decreased by $4.2 billion to $17.0 billion in 2016 when compared to 2015, primarily due to lower cash receipts as a result of lower product sales and higher cash payments related to accrued government and other rebates and chargebacks.
cash used in investing activities cash used in investing activities primarily consists of acquisitions (net of cash acquired), net purchases of marketable securities and other investments and our capital expenditures. cash used in investing activities increased by $4.1 billion to $16.1 billion in 2017 when compared to 2016, primarily due to our acquisition of kite, partially offset by lower net purchases of marketable securities.
cash used in investing activities decreased by $490 million to $12.0 billion in 2016 when compared to 2015, primarily due to lower net purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by other investments related to our license and collaboration agreement with galapagos.
cash provided by (used in) financing activities cash provided by financing activities was $3.4 billion in 2017, compared to cash used in financing activities of $9.7 billion in 2016, primarily due to lower repurchases of our common stock and higher proceeds from the issuances of debt to partially fund our acquisition of kite.
cash used in financing activities increased by $3.8 billion to $9.7 billion in 2016 when compared to 2015, primarily due to higher repurchases of our common stock, higher net payments on debt, higher payments of cash dividends and lower proceeds from the issuances of debt. these increases were partially offset by lower payments to settle warrants related to our convertible senior notes that were due in may 2016.
debt and credit facilities long-term obligations the summary of our borrowings under various financing arrangements is included in note 11, debt and credit facilities of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
senior unsecured notes in 2017, in connection with our acquisition of kite, we issued $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes consisting of $750 million principal amount of floating rate notes due september 2018, $750 million principal amount of floating rate notes due march 2019, and $500 million principal amount of floating rate notes due september 2019 (collectively, the floating rate notes) and $1.0 billion principal amount of 1.85% senior notes due september 2019 (the fixed rate notes and, collectively with the floating rate notes, the 2017 notes). the floating rate notes bear interest rates equal to three month london interbank offered rates (libor), plus 0.17% with respect to the floating rate notes due september 2018, 0.22% with respect to the floating rate notes due march 2019 and 0.25% with respect to the floating rate notes due september 2019. the fixed rate notes will pay interest semiannually and the floating rate notes will pay interest quarterly.
we are required to comply with certain covenants under our notes indentures and as of december 31, 2017, we were not in violation of any covenants.
term loan facilities in september 2017, we entered into a $6.0 billion aggregate principal amount term loan facility credit agreement consisting of a $1.0 billion principal amount 364-day senior unsecured term loan facility, a $2.5 billion principal amount three-year senior unsecured term loan facility and a $2.5 billion principal amount five-year senior unsecured term loan facility (collectively, the term loan facilities). in october 2017, we drew $6.0 billion aggregate principal amount on the term loan facilities and used the proceeds to finance our acquisition of kite.
the term loan facilities bear interest at floating rates based on libor plus an applicable margin which will vary based on our debt ratings from fitch ratings, inc., moody's investors service, inc. and s&p global ratings. the 364-day senior unsecured term loan facility and three-year senior unsecured term loan facility will be due and payable at maturity. the five-year senior unsecured term loan facility will be payable in quarterly amounts equal to 2.5% of the initial principal amount of the five-year senior unsecured term loan facility on each fiscal quarter end date after the second anniversary of the closing date, with any remaining balance due and payable at maturity. we may prepay loans under the term loan facilities in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. amounts repaid under the term loan facilities cannot be reborrowed. the term loan facilities contain customary representations, warranties, affirmative, negative and financial maintenance covenants and events of default. as of december 31, 2017, we were not in violation of any covenants.
in 2017, we repaid $1.5 billion of principal balance related to the three-year senior unsecured term loan facility and $311 million of our term loan facility issued in may 2016.
credit facilities in 2016, we terminated our five-year $1.3 billion revolving credit facility and entered into a $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility maturing in may 2021 (the five-year revolving credit agreement). the revolving credit facility can be used for working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, acquisitions. we are required to comply with certain covenants under the five-year revolving credit agreement and as of december 31, 2017, we were not in violation of any covenants, and no amounts were outstanding under the five-year revolving credit agreement.
capital return program stock repurchase programs in the first quarter of 2016, our board of directors authorized a $12.0 billion stock repurchase program (2016 program), under which repurchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. the 2016 program commenced after the $15.0 billion stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in january 2015 was completed in the second quarter of 2016. the $5.0 billion stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in may 2014 was completed in the first quarter of 2015. as of december 31, 2017, the remaining authorized repurchase amount under the 2016 program was $8.0 billion.
(2)               includes 36 million shares repurchased for $3.0 billion under the 2016 program and 87 million shares repurchased for $8.0 billion under the 2015 program.
(3)               includes 65 million shares repurchased for $7.0 billion under the 2015 program and 30 million shares repurchased for $3.0 billion under the 2014 program.
dividends on february 6, 2018, we announced that our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.57 per share of our common stock, with a payment date of march 29, 2018 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on march 16, 2018. future dividends are subject to declaration by the board of directors.
during 2017, we declared and paid quarterly cash dividends for an aggregate amount of $2.7 billion or $2.08 per common share. during 2016, we declared and paid quarterly cash dividends for an aggregate amount of $2.5 billion or $1.84 per common share. see note 13, stockholders' equity of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
capital resources we believe our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash flows generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following:
•   the commercial performance of our current and future products;
•   the progress and scope of our r&amp;d efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials;
•   the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews;
•   the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities;
•   the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities;
•   the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products;
•   debt service requirements;
•   the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and
•   costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of government investigations and litigation, including matters related to sofosbuvir.
we may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. if such funding is required, we cannot guarantee that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all.
other in 2004, we entered into a collaboration arrangement with bristol-myers squibb company (bms) to develop and commercialize a single tablet regimen containing our truvada and bms's sustiva (efavirenz) in the united states and canada. this combination was approved for use in the united states in 2006 and is sold under the brand name atripla. we and bms structured this collaboration as a joint venture that operated as a limited liability company, which we consolidated. we and bms granted royalty-free sublicenses to the joint venture for the use of our respective company owned technologies and, in return, were granted certain licenses by the joint venture to use the intellectual property resulting from the collaboration. the economic interests of the joint venture held by us and bms (including the sharing of revenues and out-of-pocket expenses) were based on the portion of the net selling price of atripla attributable to truvada and efavirenz. since the net selling price for truvada changed over time relative to the net selling price of efavirenz, both our and bms's respective economic interests in the joint venture varied annually over the course of the collaboration.
under the agreement, either party could terminate the other party's participation in the collaboration within 30 days after the launch of at least one generic version of such other party's single agent products (or double agent products). the terminating party then had the right to continue to sell atripla and become the continuing party, but was obligated to pay the terminated party certain royalties for a three-year period following the effective date of the termination.
in december 2017, a generic version of efavirenz was launched in the united states. upon the generic version launch, we terminated bms's participation in the collaboration and became the continuing party and the sole owner of the joint venture. december 31, 2017 was the last day of the collaboration. as a result of the termination and the transfer to gilead of bms's ownership interest in the joint venture, we consolidate the limited liability company as a wholly-owned subsidiary. bms no longer has any ownership interest in the joint venture and is not permitted to commercialize atripla in the united states and canada, but is entitled to receive from us certain royalties on net sales of atripla for the next three calendar years, on a declining annual scale. we may continue to purchase efavirenz from bms as needed to continue manufacturing atripla for the united states and canada markets.
see note 10, collaborative arrangements of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate and base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition product sales we recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. we record product sales net of estimated mandatory and supplemental discounts to government payers, in addition to discounts to private payers, and other related charges. these are generally referred to as gross-to-net deductions and are recorded in the same period the related sales occur. government and other rebates and chargebacks represent the majority of our gross-to-net deductions and require complex and significant judgment by management. estimates are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information.
government and other rebates and chargebacks government and other rebates and chargebacks include amounts paid to payers and healthcare providers in the united states, including medicaid rebates, aids drug assistance programs, veterans administration and public health service discounts, and other rebates, as well as foreign government rebates. rebates and chargebacks are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which may vary by product, by payer and individual payer plans.
for qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers or other distributors at a lower contractual price, the wholesalers or distributors charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual price. our consolidated allowances for government and other chargebacks that are payable to our direct customers are classified as reductions of accounts receivable, and totaled $340 million as of december 31, 2017 and $636 million as of december 31, 2016.
our consolidated allowance for government and other rebates that will be paid to parties other than our direct customers are recorded in accrued government and other rebates on our consolidated balance sheets, and totaled $4.7 billion as of december 31, 2017 and $5.0 billion as of december 31, 2016.
our allowances for government and other rebates and chargebacks are estimated based on products sold, historical utilization rates, pertinent third-party industry information, estimated patient population, known market events or trends, channel inventory data and/or other market data. we also consider new information regarding changes in programs' regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates and/or our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs. we believe that the methodology that we use to estimate our government and other rebates and chargebacks is reasonable and appropriate given the current facts and circumstances. however, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. during the last three years, our actual government rebates and chargebacks claimed for prior periods have varied by less than 5% from our estimates.
the following table summarizes the consolidated activities and ending balances in our government and other rebates and chargebacks accounts (in millions):
activity related to 2017 sales                                             $-                                   $15,809                  $(11,170      )                   $4,639
activity related to sales prior to 2017                                 5,657                                      (264              )   (4,988        )                      405
activity related to 2016 sales                                             $-                                   $19,219                  $(13,920      )                   $5,299
activity related to sales prior to 2016                                 5,025                                      (148              )   (4,519        )                      358
legal contingencies we are a party to various legal actions. the most significant of these are described in note 12, commitments and contingencies - legal proceedings of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. it is not possible to determine the outcome of these matters. we recognize accruals for such actions to the extent that we conclude that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. we accrue for the best estimate of a loss within a range; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, then we accrue the minimum amount in the range. if we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss.
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. because of the inherent uncertainty and unpredictability related to these matters, accruals are based on what we believe to be the best information available at the time of our assessment, including the legal facts and circumstances of the case, status of the proceedings, applicable law and the views of legal counsel. upon the final resolution of such matters, it is possible that there may be a loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. we periodically reassess these matters when additional information becomes available and adjust our estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances indicate the need for any changes.
we did not recognize any accruals for such matters as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 as we did not believe losses were probable.
valuation of intangible assets in conjunction with our business combinations, we have recorded intangible assets primarily related to ipr&d projects. we had total intangible assets of $17.1 billion as of december 31, 2017, compared to $9.0 billion as of december 31, 2016.
the identifiable intangible assets are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date and may be subject to revision within the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date. the models used in valuing these intangible assets require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to:
•   estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates;
•   the probability of success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development;
•   the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates;
•   the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals; and
•   risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets.
we believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination using information known and knowable and are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates.
intangible assets related to ipr&d projects are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated r&d efforts. if and when development is complete, which generally occurs if and when regulatory approval to market a product is obtained, the associated assets would be deemed finite-lived and would then be amortized based on their respective estimated useful lives at that point in time. during the period the assets are considered indefinite-lived, they are not amortized but are tested for impairment on an annual basis as well as between annual tests if we become aware of any events or changes that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair values of the ipr&d projects are below their respective carrying amounts. the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets is dependent on assumptions such as the expected timing or probability of achieving the specified milestones, changes in projected revenues or changes in discount rates. significant judgment is employed in determining these assumptions and changes to our assumptions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in any given period.
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives primarily on a straight-line basis. intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.
on october 3, 2017, in connection with our kite acquisition, we acquired intangible assets primarily related to ipr&d for axicabtagene ciloleucel, kite-585 and kte-c19, which had an estimated aggregate fair value of $9.0 billion. on october 18, 2017, fda approved axicabtagene ciloleucel, now known commercially as yescarta, making it the first car t cell therapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large b-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy, which includes diffuse large b-cell lymphoma, transformed follicular lymphoma and primary mediastinal b-cell lymphoma. upon approval, we reclassified $6.2 billion of the purchased ipr&d as a finite-lived intangible asset. we are amortizing this asset over an estimated useful life of 18 years using the straight-line method. see note 5, acquisitions of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
as of december 31, 2017, we had indefinite-lived intangible assets of $2.8 billion which consisted of purchased ipr&d from our acquisition of kite. see note 5, acquisitions of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
in 2016, the estimated fair value of our ipr&d related to momelotinib and simtuzumab was written down to zero due to termination of clinical developments of such programs, and as a result, we recorded impairment charges of $432 million within research and development expenses on our consolidated statements of income included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
provision for income taxes we estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. we evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. we consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. if we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made. the valuation allowance was $162 million as of december 31, 2017 and $126 million as of december 31, 2016. the increase of our valuation allowance from december 31, 2016 to december 31, 2017 was primarily related to kite.
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions including ireland. due to economic and political conditions, various countries are actively considering and have made changes to existing tax laws (for example, the united states recently enacted significant tax reform, and certain provisions of the new law will significantly affect us). we cannot predict the form or timing of potential legislative changes that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.
on december 22, 2017, tax reform was signed into law in the united states making significant changes to the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended. changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after december 31, 2017, implementation of a modified territorial tax system and a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. we calculated a provisional estimate of the impact from tax reform in our 2017 income tax provision in accordance with our interpretation of tax reform and guidance available as of the date of this filing. as a result, we recorded an estimated $5.5 billion net charge to income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which tax reform was enacted. this amount includes: i) a provisional $308 million deferred tax benefit related to the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on the revised rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, and ii) a provisional $5.8 billion charge related to the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings determined as of december 31, 2017. the provisional transition tax charge includes federal (net of certain offsetting adjustments related to unrecognized tax benefits), state and local, and foreign withholding tax on the accumulated foreign earnings, which are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested as of december 31, 2017.
in accordance with the sec sab 118, we have determined that the $308 million of the deferred tax benefit recorded in connection with the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities and the $5.8 billion of current tax expense recorded in connection with the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings are provisional and subject to further adjustment during the measurement period (not to exceed one year from the enactment of tax reform). given the complexity of tax reform, we may be refining our estimates of these provisional amounts as further guidance is issued from the u.s. treasury, the sec and the fasb.
additionally, we are continuing to evaluate the accounting policy election required with regard to the tax on global intangible low-taxed income (the global minimum tax). the fasb allows companies to adopt a policy election to account for the global minimum tax under one of two methods: (i) account for the global minimum tax as a component of tax expense in the period in which a company is subject to the rules (the period cost method), or (ii) account for the global minimum tax in a company's measurement of deferred taxes (the deferred method). we have not elected a method and will only do so after our completion of the analysis of the global minimum tax provisions. our election method will depend, in part, on analyzing expected future u.s. taxable income inclusions related to global minimum tax under both methodologies in order to determine the most appropriate method. should we decide to elect the deferred method of accounting for the global minimum tax, it is possible that our provisional estimate for re-measuring our deferred taxes may materially change. we will finalize the analysis for the accounting policy election during the measurement period.
we record liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period.
of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $1.8 billion at both december 31, 2017 and 2016, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. as of december 31, 2017, we believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $800 million in the next 12 months due to potential settlement of tax examinations and lapse of statute of limitations.
we file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in the united states and in many foreign jurisdictions. for federal and california income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2010 and onwards. for certain acquired entities, the statute of limitations is open for all years from inception due to our utilization of their net operating losses and credits carried over from prior years.
our income tax returns are subject to audit by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. we are currently under examination by the irs for the tax years from 2010 to 2014 and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. there are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations and, as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. we periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions.

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of regulation s-k.
contractual obligations our contractual obligations consist of debt obligations, operating leases, capital commitments, purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory-related items and clinical trials contracts. the following table summarizes our significant enforceable and legally binding obligations, future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that certain of these obligations may be cancelable as of december 31, 2017 (in millions):
capital commitments (2)                 535                     450                      85                     -                         -
transition tax payable (6)            6,084                     487                   1,460                 1,460                     2,677
(1)   debt primarily consisted of senior unsecured notes and term loan facilities, including principal and interest payments. interest payments for our fixed rate senior unsecured notes are incurred and calculated based on terms of the related notes. interest payments for our variable rate debt are calculated based on the interest rates on the last reset date in 2017 for each debt instrument. see note 11, debt and credit facilities of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
(2)   amounts include firm capital project commitments primarily relating to construction of new buildings.
(3)   amounts include firm purchase commitments primarily relating to active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain inventory-related items. these amounts include minimum purchase requirements.
(4)   in addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration and development arrangements. payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and have not been included in the table above.
(5)   at december 31, 2017, we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to contract research organizations (cros). although all of our material contracts with cros are cancelable, we historically have not canceled such contracts. these amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or terminations of, existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts.
(6)   in connection with tax reform, as of december 31, 2017, we recorded a federal income tax payable of $6.1 billion of transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. the amounts included in the table above represent the federal income tax payable of $6.1 billion of the transition tax that will be payable over an eight year period. amounts associated with tax reform are considered provisional and may be subject to further adjustment during the measurement period. see note 17, income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional details on tax reform.
(7)   as of december 31, 2017, our long-term income taxes payable include unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties totaling $1.2 billion. due to the high degree of uncertainty on the timing of future cash settlement and other events that could extinguish these unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to estimate the period of cash settlement and therefore we have excluded these unrecognized tax benefits from the table above.
recent accounting pronouncements the information required by this item is included in note 1, organization and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.

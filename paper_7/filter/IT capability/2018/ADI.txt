acquisition of linear technology corporation on march 10, 2017 (acquisition date), we completed the acquisition of linear technology corporation (linear), a designer, manufacturer and marketer of high performance analog integrated circuits. the total consideration paid to acquire linear was approximately $15.8 billion, consisting of $11.1 billion in cash financed through existing cash on hand, net proceeds from bridge and term loan facilities and proceeds received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes, $4.6 billion from the issuance of our common stock and $0.1 billion of consideration related to the replacement of outstanding equity awards held by linear employees. the acquisition of linear is referred to as the acquisition. the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k include the financial results of linear prospectively from the acquisition date. see note 6, acquisitions and note 14, debt, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information.
revenue trends by end market the following table summarizes revenue by end market. the categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the "sold to" customer information, the "ship to" customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. as data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. when this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market.

gross margin percentage in fiscal 2018 increased by 840 basis points compared to fiscal 2017, primarily because fiscal 2017 included cost of sales adjustments of $358.7 million related to the sale of acquired linear inventory written up to fair value. additionally, the increase in gross margin percentage in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017 was a result of a mix shift in favor of higher margin products being sold resulting from the acquisition and lower cost of sales resulting from favorable factory variances related to increased utilization at our manufacturing facilities. the increase in gross margin percentage in fiscal 2018 was partially offset by increases in amortization expense of developed technology intangible assets and depreciation expense related to fixed assets as a result of a full year of expense for each related to the acquisition.
gross margin percentage in fiscal 2017 decreased by 520 basis points compared to fiscal 2016, primarily as a result of recording additional cost related to acquisition accounting adjustments, including $358.7 million related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value, $83.0 million related to amortization of acquired developed technology intangible assets, and $22.9 million of depreciation related to fixed assets as a result of the acquisition. the increases in cost of sales as a result of acquisition accounting adjustments were partially offset by favorable factory variances as a result of increased utilization at our manufacturing facilities.

r&d expenses increased in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. approximately $147.8 million of the overall increase was a result of the acquisition. the remainder of the increase was primarily the result of increases in operational spending and r&d employee and related benefit expenses, partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth. the additional week of operations in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 also contributed to the increase in operational spending and r&d employee and related benefit expenses in fiscal 2018.
r&d expenses increased in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. approximately $205.2 million of the overall increase was a result of the acquisition. the remainder of the increase was primarily the result of an increase in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth and an increase in r&d employee and related benefit expenses and to a lesser extent an increase in operational spending.
r&d expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. we have hundreds of r&d projects underway, none of which we believe are material on an individual basis. we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products. we believe that a continued commitment to r&d is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant r&d investments in the future.

smg&a expenses increased in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of a $55.5 million increase in smg&a expenses as a result of the acquisition, partially offset by a decrease of $50.6 million in acquisition-related transaction costs, which include legal, accounting, other related fees and integration costs resulting from the acquisition.
smg&a expenses increased in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of the acquisition and acquisition-related costs. approximately $119.8 million of the total increase was a result of the acquisition. acquisition-related costs, which include legal, accounting, other related fees and integration costs resulting from the acquisition, increased $56.9 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. the remainder of the increase in smg&a expenses was a result of increases in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth and an increase in smg&a employee and related benefit expenses.

amortization expenses increased in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of a full year of amortization expense for intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition and to a lesser extent, other acquisitions in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018.
amortization expenses increased in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of the purchase of intangible assets as part of the acquisition and to a lesser extent, other acquisitions in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017.
special charges we monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency, as well as a better alignment of expenses with revenues. as a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years.
in fiscal 2018, we recorded special charges of $44.5 million as a result of our decision to consolidate certain wafer and test facility operations acquired as part of the acquisition. over the next two to four years, we plan to close our hillview wafer fabrication facility located in milpitas, california and our singapore test facility. we intend to transfer hillview wafer fabrication production to our other internal facilities and to external foundries. in addition, we are planning to transition testing operations currently handled in our singapore facility to our facilities in penang, malaysia and the philippines, in addition to our outsourced assembly and test partners. the special charge recognized as a result of this action consists of severance and related benefit costs. we expect that this action will result in estimated annual salary, variable compensation and employee benefit savings of approximately $60.0 million once fully implemented.
special charges of $16.9 million, $8.1 million and $13.7 million were recorded in fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively, in an effort to reduce overall operating costs. in addition, in fiscal 2017 we recorded a special charge of
$41.3 million related to an early retirement offer action, which we expect will result in estimated annual salary, variable compensation, and employee benefit savings of approximately $28.4 million once fully implemented.

the increase in operating income in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 was the result of a $1.2 billion increase in gross margin, partially offset by a $196.8 million increase in r&d expenses, a $131.6 million increase in amortization expense, an $11.8 million increase in special charges, and a $4.9 million increase in smg&a expenses as more fully described above under the headings research and development (r&d), amortization of intangibles, special charges and selling, marketing, general and administrative (smg&a).
the increase in operating income in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was the result of a $834.4 million increase in gross margin, partially offset by a $314.8 million increase in r&d expenses, a $229.6 million increase in smg&a expenses, a $227.2 million increase in amortization expenses and a $35.8 million increase in special charges as more fully described above under the headings research and development (r&d), selling, marketing, general and administrative (smg&a), amortization of intangibles and special charges.

the year-over-year increase in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2018 was primarily the result of a decrease in interest income as a result of lower invested cash balances in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, and an increase in interest expense related to financing commitments entered into in fiscal 2017 in connection with the acquisition and $750 million of senior unsecured notes issued in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, partially offset by a reduction in fees related to financing commitments which were entered into prior to and upon the acquisition, which terminated during fiscal 2017.
the increase in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily the result of an increase in interest expense as a result of the issuance of $1.3 billion of senior unsecured notes in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, $2.1 billion of senior unsecured notes in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and as a result of fees paid and financing commitments entered into in connection with the acquisition, including a 90-day bridge credit agreement in the principal amount of $4.1 billion, a 3-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion and a 5-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion. the increase in nonoperating expense as a result of the increase in interest expense was partially offset by an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates earned on our investments, partially offset by lower cash balances in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.
see note 14, debt, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on debt issuances and commitments related to the acquisition.

our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned. our effective income tax rate can also be impacted each year by discrete factors or events.
the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (tax legislation), enacted on december 22, 2017, contains significant changes to u.s. tax law, including lowering the u.s. corporate income tax rate to 21.0%, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. as of november 3, 2018, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the tax legislation. however, as described below, we have made reasonable estimates of the effects on its existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax in fiscal 2018.
the tax legislation reduced the u.s. statutory tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, effective january 1, 2018, which results in a blended statutory income tax rate for us of 23.4% for fiscal 2018. for the fiscal year ending november 2, 2019 (fiscal 2019), our u.s. federal statutory income tax rate will be 21.0%.
the tax rate for fiscal 2018 was below our blended u.s. federal statutory tax rate of 23.4% for fiscal 2018 resulting from the passage of the tax legislation, primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income and $25.6 million of tax benefit related to the release of uncertain tax positions due to lapses in statute of limitation. similarly, fiscal 2017 was below the then u.s. statutory tax rate of 35%, primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income and a tax benefit of $50.5 million related to the reduction of reserves and related interest resulting from the u.s. tax court's favorable ruling, offset by approximately $98.2 million of tax expense incurred during the year as part of the post-acquisition integration.
in addition, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 includes a provisional estimate for a tax benefit of $637.0 million from remeasuring our u.s. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the lower 21.0% u.s. federal statutory tax rate. fiscal 2018 also includes a provisional estimate of $691.0 million for the discrete tax charge from the tax legislation's one-time transition tax associated with our undistributed foreign earnings, which is comprised of a $755.0 million transitional tax liability less a deferred tax liability of $64.0 million that was recorded in prior years.
additionally, we recorded discrete benefits for excess tax benefits from share-based payments of $26.2 million in fiscal 2018. our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 also included a tax benefit of $15.0 million for the release of a state tax credit valuation allowance as a result of the acquisition.
the tax legislation contains many provisions that are effective for tax years beginning on or after january 1, 2018.  because we are a fiscal year u.s. taxpayer, certain provisions, such as the foreign-derived intangible income deduction on certain foreign-source income and new limitations on certain business deductions, will begin applying to us for our fiscal year ending november 2, 2019 (fiscal 2019).  for fiscal 2018, the most significant impacts include a lower u.s. federal corporate income tax rate, a re-measurement of certain net deferred taxes to reflect the revised tax rates and a new transition tax on the deemed repatriation of certain foreign earnings.
non-u.s. jurisdictions accounted for approximately 75.9% of our total revenues for fiscal 2018, compared to approximately 77.3% of our total revenues fiscal 2017. this revenue generated outside of the u.s. results in a material portion of our pretax income being taxed outside the u.s., primarily in bermuda, ireland and singapore, at tax rates ranging from 0% to 33.3%. we have a partial tax holiday in malaysia through july 2025. a partial tax holiday in singapore had been in place through august 2019, but was terminated effective september 2018 due to negotiations with the economic development board. the aggregate dollar benefits derived from these tax holidays approximated $27.7 million and $27.4 million in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. the impact of the tax holidays during fiscal 2018 increased the basic and diluted net income per common share by $0.07 each. the impact of the tax holidays during fiscal 2017 increased the basic and diluted net income per common share by $0.08 each. the impact on our provision for income taxes on income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the u.s. federal statutory rate was a benefit of approximately $434.8 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 7.4% for fiscal 2018, compared to a benefit of approximately $385.1 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 7.8% for fiscal 2017. a reduction in the ratio of domestic taxable income to worldwide taxable income effectively lowers our overall tax rate, due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where we earn income are lower than the u.s. statutory rate. in addition, our effective income tax rate can be impacted each year by amounts for discrete factors or events, and acquisition-related accounting adjustments.

the increase in net income in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 was a result of a $826.6 million increase in operating income, partially offset by a $41.9 million increase in provision for income taxes, and a $16.6 million increase in nonoperating expense.
the decrease in net income in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was the result of a $155.5 million increase in nonoperating expense and a $6.0 million increase in provision for income taxes, partially offset by a $27.0 million increase in operating income.
the impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant.
liquidity and capital resources at november 3, 2018, our principal source of liquidity was $816.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $383.5 million was held in the united states. the balance of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries. we continue to assert our intent to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely, however we are in the process of analyzing the impact that the tax legislation has on this indefinite reinvestment assertion. as we intend to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely, certain cash held outside the united states may not be available for repatriation as dividends to the united states in the future. if such funds are needed for u.s. operations, we would be required to accrue and pay foreign withholding and u.s. state income taxes to the extent not already subject to taxation. our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, including money market funds. we maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk.
on the acquisition date, we entered into a 90-day bridge credit agreement that provided for unsecured loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $4.1 billion and borrowed under a term loan agreement consisting of a 3-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due march 10, 2020 and a 5-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due march 10, 2022. as of november 3, 2018, we have paid $2.1 billion of principal on the 3-year unsecured term loan, paid $1.2 billion of principal on the 5-year unsecured term loan and repaid all of the $4.1 billion of outstanding loans under the bridge credit agreement. see note 13, revolving credit facility and note 14, debt of the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information.
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and dividend payments (if any) in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months.

at november 3, 2018, cash and cash equivalents totaled $816.6 million. the following changes contributed to the net change in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017.
operating activities cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.
the increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, was primarily a result of higher net income adjusted for non-cash items, and changes in working capital, primarily resulting from increases in tax liabilities related to the one-time transition tax recognized as a result of the tax legislation.
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily due to higher tax payments as a result of the post-acquisition integration, and other changes in working capital.
investing activities investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, investment purchases, maturities and sales of available-for-sale securities, as well as cash used for acquisitions.
the decrease in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, was primarily the result of a decrease in payments for acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease of proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities.
the increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily the result of cash payments made for the acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in maturities of available for sale securities.
financing activities financing cash flows consist primarily of payments of dividends to stockholders, repurchases of common stock, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans.
the decrease in cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, was primarily due to a decrease in net proceeds of $10.4 billion received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes and financing commitments, and lower repayments of principal on the 3-year and 5-year unsecured term loans.
the increase in cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily due to an increase in net debt proceeds of $9.9 billion received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes, financing commitments entered into in connection with the acquisition, consisting of a 90-day bridge credit agreement and a term loan agreement, and a decrease in stock repurchases of $323.5 million due to the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program in connection with the acquisition. these decreases were partially offset by payments of $5.1 billion related to financing commitments entered into in connection with the acquisition.

* we use the average of the current year and prior year ending net accounts receivable and ending inventory balance in our calculation of days sales outstanding and days cost of sales in inventory, respectively. cost of sales amounts used in the calculation of days cost of sales in inventory for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 include acquisition accounting adjustments related to amortization of developed technology intangible assets acquired and depreciation related to fixed assets acquired. fiscal 2017 also included cost of sales amounts for inventory acquired in the acquisition.
the decrease in accounts receivable for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily the result of the timing of shipments and the collection of receivables.
inventory in dollars increased in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of our efforts to balance manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels. our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand.
current liabilities decreased to $1.4 billion at november 3, 2018 from $1.6 billion recorded at the end of fiscal 2017. the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the current portion of our debt.
as of november 3, 2018 and october 28, 2017, we had gross deferred revenue of $603.8 million and $589.5 million, respectively, and gross deferred cost of sales of $116.4 million and $115.5 million, respectively. deferred income on shipments to distributors decreased in fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of the distributors' sales to their customers in fiscal 2018 exceeding our shipments to our distributors during this same time period. sales to certain distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive price-adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit, as determined by us, in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. given the uncertainties associated with the levels of price-adjustment credits to be granted to certain distributors, the sales price to the distributors is not fixed or determinable until the distributors resell the products to their customers. therefore, we defer revenue recognition from sales to certain distributors until such distributors have sold the products to their customers. the amount of price-adjustments is dependent on future overall market conditions, and therefore the levels of these adjustments could fluctuate significantly from period to period. to the extent that we experience a significant increase in the amount of credits we issue to our distributors, there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross margin recognized relating to these transactions.
debt as of november 3, 2018, we had $6.3 billion of carrying value outstanding on our long-term debt. the difference in the carrying value of the debt and the principal is due to the unamortized discount and issuance fees on these instruments that will accrete to the face value over the term of the debt. our debt obligations consist of the following:
on june 3, 2013, we issued the 2023 notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on june 1 and december 1 of each year, commencing december 1, 2013.
on december 14, 2015, we issued the 2025 notes and the 2045 notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on june 15 and december 15 of each year, commencing june 15, 2016.
on december 5, 2016, we issued the 2021 notes, the december 2023 notes, the 2026 notes and the 2036 notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on june 5 and december 5 of each year, commencing june 5, 2017.
on march 12, 2018, we issued the 2020 notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on march 12 and september 12 of each year, commencing september 12, 2018, and the january 2021 notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on january 12 and july 12 of each year, commencing july 12, 2018.
the indentures governing the 2020 notes, 2021 notes, january 2021 notes, 2023 notes, december 2023 notes, 2025 notes, 2026 notes, 2036 notes and 2045 notes contain covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, any other party. as of november 3, 2018, we were compliant with these covenants. see note 14, debt, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our outstanding debt.
$5.0 billion aggregate principal term loans on the acquisition date, we drew down on a 3-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due march 10, 2020 and a 5-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due march 10, 2022. the term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the eurodollar rate plus a margin based on our debt ratings from time to time of between 0.75% and 1.63% in the case of the 3-year unsecured term loan, and a margin of between 0.88% and 1.75% in the case of the 5-year unsecured term loan. as of november 3, 2018, we have paid $2.1 billion of principal on the 3-year unsecured term loan and paid $1.2 billion of principal on the 5-year unsecured term loan.
revolving credit facility we have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders that expires on july 10, 2020. the agreement for such revolving credit facility (credit agreement) provides that we may borrow up to $1.0 billion. to date, we have not borrowed under this credit facility, but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. the terms of the credit agreement impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. in addition, the credit agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (ebitda) of not greater than 4.5 to 1.0. the debt covenant will be reduced over time to 3.0 to 1.0, which began in may 2018. as of november 3, 2018, we were compliant with these covenants. see note 13, revolving credit facility, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our revolving credit facility.
stock repurchase program our common stock repurchase program has been in place since august 2004. in the aggregate, our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase $8.2 billion of our common stock under the program. under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. unless terminated earlier by resolution of our board of directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program.
in connection with the acquisition, we temporarily suspended the share repurchase program. on august 21, 2018, we reinstated the share repurchase program, and as of november 3, 2018, we had repurchased a total of approximately 148.9 million shares of its common stock for approximately $5.6 billion under this program. an additional $2.6 billion remains available for repurchase of shares under the current authorized program. the repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. we also, from time to time, repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units/awards or the exercise of stock options.
capital expenditures net additions to property, plant and equipment were $254.9 million in fiscal 2018 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. we expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2019 to be approximately 4% of fiscal 2019 revenue. these capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations.
dividends on november 19, 2018, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.48 per outstanding share of common stock. the dividend will be paid on december 10, 2018 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on november 29, 2018 and is expected to total approximately $178 million. we currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at $0.48 per share, although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our board of directors. the payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity.
transition tax (a)                                        $755,000           $61,600                  $120,592                  $120,592                  $452,216
interest payments associated with debt obligations       1,740,053           223,796                   404,124                   281,539                   830,594
(a)   the tax legislation, enacted on december 22, 2017, contains significant changes to u.s. tax law, including lowering the u.s. corporate income tax rate to 21.0%, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. as part of transitioning to the territorial tax system, the tax legislation includes a one-time transition tax that we intend to elect to pay over a period of eight years that begins in fiscal 2019 on an interest free basis.
(b)   certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. these escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table.
(c)   debt obligations are assumed to be held to maturity.
(d)   these payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan. the deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. the amount in the "more than 5 years" column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment. since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment, we have included the future obligation to these participants in the "more than 5 years" column of the table.
(e)   our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. the payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2019. the actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables, such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels.
as of november 3, 2018, our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was $16.8 million, which are included in non-current income taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheet contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. due to the complexity associated with our deferred taxes and tax uncertainties, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non-current liabilities associated with these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions. therefore, we have not included these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table.
the expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of november 3, 2018.
new accounting pronouncements from time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board (fasb) and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. see note 2t, new accounting pronouncements, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations.
revenue recognition in may 2014, the fasb issued accounting standards update 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (asu 2014-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states (u.s. gaap). the core principle of asu 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. the fasb has issued several amendments and updates to the new revenue standard, including guidance related to when an entity should recognize revenue gross as a principal or net as an agent and how an entity should identify performance obligations.  as amended, asu 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2017, which is our first quarter of fiscal 2019. we are approaching the final stage of our project plan for the implementation of the guidance. we have reviewed our revenue streams, including those from the acquisition, and are nearing completion in assessing all potential impacts of the standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, including any impacts from recently issued amendments, and retrospectively adjusting financial information for prior fiscal years. the most significant impact of adopting the new standard will be related to the timing of recognition of sales to certain distributors. as described in note 2, revenue recognition, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, we currently defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to certain distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers. upon adoption of asu 2014-09, we will no longer be permitted to defer revenue until sale by the distributor to the end customer, but rather, will be required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor. we will adopt asu 2014-09, using the full retrospective method, upon its effective date for us which is our first quarter of fiscal 2019.
critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. if actual results differ significantly from management's estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.
revenue recognition revenue from product sales to customers is generally recognized when title passes, which is upon shipment in the u.s. and in certain foreign counties. revenue from product sales to other foreign countries is recognized subsequent to product shipment. title for these shipments to these other foreign countries ordinarily passes within a week of shipment. accordingly, we defer the revenue recognized relating to these other foreign countries until title has passed. for multiple element arrangements, we allocate arrangement consideration among the elements based on the relative fair values of those elements as determined using vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence. we use our best estimate of selling price to allocate arrangement consideration between the deliverables in cases where neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence is available. a reserve for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve.
revenue from contracts with the united states government, government prime contractors and some commercial customers is generally recorded on a percentage of completion basis, using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion. the output measure is used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established. estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables. contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule. contract costs include material, subcontract costs, labor and an allocation of indirect costs. the estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract. changes in contract performance, estimated gross margin, including the impact of final contract settlements, and estimated losses are recognized in the period in which the changes or losses are determined.
revenue from product sales to certain international distributors are made under agreements that permit limited stock return privileges but not sales price rebates. revenue on these sales is recognized upon shipment at which time title passes.
we defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to u.s. distributors and certain international distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers. as a result, our revenue fully reflects end customer purchases and is not impacted by distributor inventory levels. sales to certain of these distributors are made under agreements that allow such distributors to receive price-adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit, as determined by us, in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. these agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of the value of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter. in addition, such distributors are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the relationship with the distributor. given the uncertainties associated with the levels of price-adjustment credits to be granted to certain distributors, the sales price to the distributor is not fixed or determinable until the distributor resells the products to their customers. therefore, we defer revenue recognition from sales to certain distributors until such distributors have sold the products to their customers.
inventory valuation we value inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. while a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. to date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future.
long-lived assets we review property, plant, and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining estimated lives. if such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. these differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. in these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. we review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, on the first day of the fourth quarter (on or about august 5) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. we perform a qualitative assessment on our indefinite-lived intangible assets to determine whether it is more likely-than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. if it is determined that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value, we would compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment equal to any amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value.
goodwill goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis in the fourth quarter (on or about august 5) or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value. if we elect not to use this option, or we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value, then we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. in prior periods, we did not elect to use the qualitative option for assessing goodwill and instead proceeded directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. the goodwill impairment test requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. if fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the amount of the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. additionally, we consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. we determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of the income and market approaches. under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow methodology which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others. for the market approach, we use the guideline public company method. under this method we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested, in order to obtain their respective fair values. in order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit fair values, we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units determined, as described above, to its current market capitalization, allowing for a reasonable control premium.
in our latest annual impairment evaluation that occurred as of august 5, 2018, we used the qualitative method of assessing goodwill for all eight of our identified reporting units, which we determined are the same as our eight operating segments. for each of the reporting units, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values were less than their net book values. in making this determination, we considered several factors, including the following:
-   the amount by which the fair values of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis, which indicated there would need to be substantial negative developments in the markets in which these reporting units operate in order for there to be potential impairment;
-   the carrying values of these reporting units as of august 5, 2018 compared to the previously calculated fair values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis;
-   the current forecasts as compared to the forecasts included in the most recent quantitative impairment analysis;
-   public information from competitors and other industry information to determine if there were any significant adverse trends in our competitors' businesses, such as significant declines in market capitalization or significant goodwill impairment charges that could be an indication that the goodwill of our reporting units was potentially impaired;
-   changes in the value of major u.s. stock indices that could suggest declines in overall market stability that could impact the valuation of our reporting units;
-   changes in our market capitalization and overall enterprise valuation to determine if there were any significant decreases that could be an indication that the valuation of our reporting units had significantly decreased; and
-   whether there had been any significant increases to the weighted-average cost of capital (wacc) rates for each reporting unit, which could materially lower our prior valuation conclusions under a discounted cash flow approach.
business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, we recognize tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. we record the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the value of the net assets acquired as goodwill. the accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets and the fair value of contingent payment obligations. critical estimates in valuing purchased technology, customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could experience impairment charges which could be material. in addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. if our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.
we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. we generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation. each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the consolidated statement of income. changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates, and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones. significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. accordingly, future business and economic conditions, as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above, can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period.
accounting for income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. we assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers. in reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in u.s. or international tax laws and other factors. these changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made, which in turn, may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.
we account for uncertain tax positions by determining if it is "more likely than not" that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements. an uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. a change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
in the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. in the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. in addition to the factors described above, our current and expected effective tax rate is based on then-current tax law. significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates.
the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (tax legislation) significantly changes existing u.s. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business. see note 12, income taxes, of the of the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion.
stock-based compensation stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the consolidated statements of income. determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options and market-based restricted stock units. we calculate the grant-date fair values of stock options using the black-scholes valuation model. the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of key assumptions such as expected option term and stock price volatility to determine the fair value of a stock option. the estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends. we recognize the expense related to equity awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. see note 3, stock-based compensation and shareholders' equity, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information related to stock based compensation.
contingencies from time to time, in the ordinary course of business, various claims, charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against us arising from, or related to, contractual matters, patents, trademarks, personal injury, environmental matters, product liability, insurance coverage and personnel and employment disputes. we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. in making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. if a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss. in determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. if the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations.

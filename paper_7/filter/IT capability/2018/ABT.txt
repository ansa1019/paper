item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial review abbott's revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of abbott's products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. abbott's primary products are cardiovascular and neuromodulation products, diagnostic testing products, nutritional products and branded generic pharmaceuticals. sales in international markets comprise approximately 65 percent of consolidated net sales.
over the last several years, abbott proactively shaped the company with the strategic intent to deliver sustainable growth in all of its businesses. significant steps over the last three years included:
 in january 2017, abbott acquired st. jude medical, inc. (st. jude medical), a global medical device manufacturer, for approximately $23.6 billion, including approximately $13.6 billion in cash and approximately $10 billion in abbott common shares, based on abbott's closing stock price on the acquisition date. as part of the acquisition, abbott assumed, repaid or refinanced approximately $5.9 billion of st. jude medical's debt. the acquisition provided expanded opportunities for future growth and is an important part of the company's effort to develop a strong, diverse portfolio. the combined business competes in nearly every area of the $30 billion global cardiovascular device market, as well as in neuromodulation which treats chronic pain and movement disorders.
 in october 2017, abbott acquired alere inc. (alere), a diagnostic device and service provider, for $51.00 per common share in cash, which equated to a purchase price of approximately $4.5 billion. as part of the acquisition, abbott also tendered for alere's preferred shares for a total value of approximately
$0.7 billion and assumed and subsequently repaid approximately $3.0 billion of alere's debt. the acquisition established abbott as a leader in point of care testing, expanded abbott's global diagnostics presence and provided access to new products, channels and geographies.
 in february 2017, abbott completed the sale of abbott medical optics (amo), its vision care business, to johnson & johnson for
$4.325 billion in cash and recognized an after-tax gain of $728 million. the operating results of amo were included in earnings from continuing operations up to the date of sale as the business did not qualify for reporting as discontinued operations.
the sales increase over the last three years reflects both the 2017 acquisitions of st. jude medical and alere and volume growth across abbott's businesses, most notably in the established pharmaceuticals, diabetes care and diagnostics businesses. volume growth reflects the introduction of new products as well as higher sales of existing products. in 2017, the acquisitions of st. jude medical and alere, partially offset by the sale of amo, contributed 26.5 percentage points of abbott's total sales growth versus 2016. sales in emerging markets, which represent approximately 40 percent of total company sales, increased 12.3 percent in 2018 and 13.9 percent in 2017, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. (emerging markets include all countries except the united states, western europe, japan, canada, australia and new zealand.)
over the last three years, abbott's operating margin was positively impacted by margin improvements across various businesses, including established pharmaceuticals, core laboratory, and diabetes care, partially offset by higher amortization and other costs associated with the acquisitions. in 2018, abbott's operating margin increased by approximately 6 percentage points primarily due to operating margin improvement in various businesses and lower inventory step-up amortization and integration costs associated with the acquisitions, partially offset by higher intangible amortization. in 2017, abbott's operating margin decreased by approximately 9 percentage points primarily due to costs associated with the acquisitions, including higher intangible amortization expense, inventory step-up amortization and integration costs, partially offset by operating margin improvement in various businesses.
since the beginning of the first quarter of 2017, the results of abbott's cardiovascular and neuromodulation products segment include abbott's historical vascular products segment and st. jude medical from the date of acquisition. excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales in the cardiovascular and neuromodulation products segment increased 4.9 percent in 2018 and 207.4 percent in 2017. the sales increase in 2018 was driven primarily by higher structural heart, electrophysiology, and neuromodulation sales. the sales increase in 2017 was driven by the acquisition of st. jude medical. excluding the impact of the acquisition, as well as the impact of foreign exchange, sales in the cardiovascular and neuromodulation products segment were essentially unchanged in 2017 versus the prior year. in 2017, higher structural heart and endovascular sales were offset by lower coronary stent sales and the comparison impact from the favorable 2016 resolution of a third-party royalty agreement in abbott's vascular business.
in 2018, operating earnings for this segment increased 9.9 percent. the operating margin profile declined from 35.8 percent of sales in 2016 to 31.7 percent in 2018 primarily due to the mix of business resulting from the acquisition of st. jude medical and ongoing pricing pressures in the coronary business. cost improvement initiatives contributed to an improvement in the operating margin profile from 30.5 percent in 2017 to 31.7 percent in 2018.
in 2018, the cardiovascular and neuromodulation products segment received approval or clearance from the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) for the following products:
 the advisor® hd grid mapping catheter, sensor enabled, which creates highly detailed maps of the heart and expands abbott's electrophysiology product portfolio,
 the next-generation version of abbott's leading mitraclip® heart valve repair device,
 the xience sierra® drug eluting stent system, which is the next generation of its drug-eluting coronary stent system. the xience sierra drug eluting stent system also received national reimbursement in japan to treat people with coronary artery disease.
in abbott's worldwide diagnostics business, sales growth over the last three years reflected the acquisition of alere in october 2017, as well as continued market penetration by the core laboratory business in the u.s. and internationally. alere's results are included in abbott's diagnostic products reportable segment from the date of acquisition. worldwide diagnostic sales increased 33.6 percent in 2018 and 16.7 percent in 2017, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. excluding the impact of the alere acquisition, as well as the impact of foreign exchange, sales in the diagnostic products segment increased 6.5 percent in 2018 and 5.5 percent in 2017. this growth includes the continued roll-out of alinity®, which is abbott's integrated family of next-generation diagnostic systems and solutions that are designed to increase efficiency by running more tests in less space, generating test results faster and minimizing human errors while continuing to provide quality results. abbott has regulatory approvals in the u.s., europe, china, and other markets for the "alinity c" and "alinity i" instruments for clinical chemistry and immunoassay diagnostics, respectively. in 2018, abbott accelerated the launch of alinity in europe and other international markets after a broad range of assays obtained regulatory approval and were added to the test menu. abbott also continued the roll-out of "alinity s" for blood and plasma screening.
margin improvement continued to be a key focus for the diagnostics business in 2018 and 2017. while operating margins of 24.9 percent of sales in 2018 have remained relatively unchanged from the 24.8 percent of sales reported in 2016, this reflects dilution to the operating margin profit from the acquisition of alere and the negative impact of foreign exchange, offset by the continued execution of efficiency initiatives in the manufacturing and supply chain functions.
in abbott's worldwide nutritional products business, sales over the last three years were positively impacted by demographics such as an aging population and an increasing rate of chronic disease in developed markets and the rise of a middle class in many emerging markets, as well as by numerous new product introductions that leveraged abbott's strong brands. in 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the nutritional business experienced above-market growth in the worldwide pediatric business driven by market leading brands similac® and pedialyte® in the u.s. as well as growth across several markets in asia. worldwide, adult nutrition sales increased in 2018 led by the growth of ensure®, abbott's market-leading complete and balanced nutrition brand, and glucerna®, abbott's market-leading diabetes-specific nutrition brand.
in 2017, the nutritionals business experienced growth in the u.s. driven by above-market performance in abbott's infant and toddler brands. internationally, 2017 sales growth in china and india was partially offset by challenging market conditions in the infant formula market in various emerging markets. with respect to the profitability of the nutritional products business, manufacturing and distribution process changes, as well as other cost reductions, drove margin improvements across the business over the last three years although such improvements were offset by inflation on commodity costs. the decrease in operating margins for this business from 24.1 percent of sales in 2016 to 22.9 percent in 2018 was primarily due to negative impact of foreign exchange.
the established pharmaceutical products segment focuses on the sale of its products in emerging markets. excluding the impact of foreign exchange, established pharmaceutical sales increased 7.0 percent in 2018 and 9.5 percent in 2017. the sales increase in 2018 was driven by double-digit growth in india and china. the sales increase in 2017 was primarily driven by double-digit growth in china and various countries in latin america. operating margins increased from 18.7 percent of sales in 2016 to 20.2 percent in 2018 primarily due to the continued focus on cost reduction initiatives.
in its diabetes business, abbott received u.s. fda approval for its freestyle libre® 14 day sensor, making it the longest lasting wearable glucose sensor available. the freestyle libre system is the only continuous glucose monitoring system that does not require any user calibration.
in conjunction with the funding of the st. jude medical and alere acquisitions and the assumption of st. jude medical's and alere's existing debt, abbott's total short-term and long-term debt increased from approximately $9.0 billion at december 31, 2015 to $27.9 billion at december 31, 2017. at the beginning of 2018, abbott committed to reducing its debt levels and in 2018 abbott repaid approximately $8.3 billion of debt, net of borrowings, bringing its total debt to $19.6 billion.
abbott declared dividends of $1.16 per share in 2018 compared to $1.075 per share in 2017, an increase of approximately 8 percent. dividends paid totaled $1.974 billion in 2018 compared to $1.849 billion in 2017. the year-over-year change in the amount of dividends paid reflects the increase in the dividend rate. in december 2018, abbott increased the company's quarterly dividend by approximately 14 percent to $0.32 per share from $0.28 per share, effective with the dividend paid in february 2019.
in 2019, abbott will focus on continuing to invest in product development areas that provide the opportunity for strong sustainable growth over the next several years. in its diagnostics business, abbott will continue to focus on driving market adoption and geographic expansion of its alinity suite of diagnostics instruments. in the cardiovascular and neuromodulation business, abbott will continue to focus on expanding its market position in various areas including electrophysiology, heart failure, and structural heart. in its nutritionals business, abbott will continue to focus on driving growth globally and further enhancing its portfolio with the introduction of several new science-based products. in the established pharmaceuticals business, abbott will continue to focus on growing its business with the depth and breadth of its portfolio in emerging markets. in its diabetes care business, abbott will focus on driving continued market adoption of its freestyle libre continuous glucose monitoring system.
critical accounting policies sales rebates   in 2018, approximately 45 percent of abbott's consolidated gross revenues were subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that abbott recorded as reductions of revenues at the time of sale. most of these rebates and allowances in 2018 are in the nutritional products and diabetes care segments. abbott provides rebates to state agencies that administer the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children (wic), wholesalers, group purchasing organizations, and other government agencies and private entities. rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product. factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when abbott records its sale of the product. settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to six months after sale. abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016 amounted to approximately $3.0 billion, $2.8 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, or 19.0 percent, 20.5 percent and 22.9 percent of gross sales, respectively, based on gross sales of approximately $16.0 billion, $13.9 billion and $10.7 billion, respectively, subject to rebate. a one-percentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by approximately $160 million in 2018. abbott considers a one-percentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales. other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately $175 million, $166 million and $160 million for cash discounts in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $191 million, $204 million and $242 million for returns in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale, and therefore can be reliably estimated. returns can be reliably estimated because abbott's historical returns are low, and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods.
management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter. in the domestic nutritional business, management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the accruals. in the wic business, estimates are required for the amount of wic sales within each state where abbott holds the wic contract. the state where the sale is made, which is the determining factor for the applicable rebated price, is reliably determinable. rebated prices are based on contractually obligated agreements generally lasting a period of two to four years. except for a change in contract price or a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the wic business in a state, accruals are based on historical redemption rates and data from the u.s. department of agriculture (usda) and the states submitting rebate claims. the usda, which administers the wic program, has been making its data available for many years. management also estimates the states' processing lag time based on sales and claims data. inventory in the retail distribution channel does not vary substantially. management has access to several large customers' inventory management data, which allows management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the retail distribution channel. at december 31, 2018, abbott had wic business in 27 states.
historically, adjustments to prior years' rebate accruals have not been material to net income. abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it, and where possible, works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts. for government agency programs, the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations, which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation.
income taxes   abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments. because abbott operates globally, the nature of the audit items is often very complex, and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country. abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible. in accordance with the accounting rules relating to the measurement of tax contingencies, in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit, the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position, and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit. application of these rules requires a significant amount of judgment. in the u.s., abbott's federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled except for the federal income tax returns of the former alere consolidated group which are settled through 2014 and the former st. jude medical consolidated group which are settled through 2013. undistributed foreign earnings remain indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in its foreign entities is not practicable.
pension and post-employment benefits   abbott offers pension benefits and post-employment health care to many of its employees. abbott engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under these programs. abbott must develop long-term assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates, discount rates and the expected return on plan assets. the discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on high-quality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits. the health care cost trend rates represent abbott's expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and are a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date. a difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates, which will not be known for years, can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs. low interest rates have significantly increased actuarial losses for these plans. at december 31, 2018, pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and (credits) recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for abbott's defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans were losses of $3.3 billion and $198 million, respectively. actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method, in accordance with the rules for accounting for post-employment benefits. differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a five-year period. note 14 to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a one-percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate; however, there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point.
valuation of intangible assets   abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that abbott records at fair value at the acquisition date. transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. abbott engages independent valuation experts who review abbott's critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles. abbott reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in impairment occurs. at december 31, 2018, goodwill amounted to $23.3 billion and net intangibles amounted to $18.9 billion. amortization expense in continuing operations for intangible assets amounted to $2.2 billion in 2018, $2.0 billion in 2017 and $550 million in 2016. there was no significant reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in 2018, 2017 and 2016.
litigation   abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with financial accounting standards board (fasb) accounting standards codification (asc) no. 450, "contingencies." under asc no. 450, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known. accordingly, abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, and therefore the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. as information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately $125 million to $165 million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures. accruals of approximately $145 million have been recorded at december 31, 2018 for these proceedings and exposures. these accruals represent management's best estimate of probable loss, as defined by fasb asc no. 450, "contingencies."
results of operations sales the following table details the components of sales growth by reportable segment for the last two years:
nutritional products segment the increase in total net sales in 2018 reflects the acquisition of alere, as well as volume growth across all of abbott's businesses. the increase in total net sales in 2017 reflects the acquisitions of st. jude medical and alere, as well as volume growth in the established pharmaceuticals and diagnostics businesses. the price declines related to the cardiovascular and neuromodulation products segment in 2018 and 2017 primarily reflect pricing pressure on drug eluting stents (des) as a result of market competition in the u.s. and other major markets.
a comparison of significant product and product group sales is as follows. percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers.

in order to compute results excluding the impact of exchange rates, current year u.s. dollar sales are multiplied or divided, as appropriate, by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then those amounts are multiplied or divided, as appropriate, by the prior year average foreign exchange rates.
total established pharmaceutical products sales increased 7.0 percent in 2018 and 9.5 percent in 2017, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. the established pharmaceutical products segment is focused on several key emerging markets including india, russia, china and brazil. excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total sales in these key emerging markets increased 7.4 percent in 2018 and 11.9 percent in 2017. excluding the impact of foreign exchange, 2018 sales in india and china and 2017 sales in china and various countries in latin america experienced double-digit growth. excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales in established pharmaceuticals' other emerging markets increased 5.8 percent in 2018 and 2.2 percent in 2017. the 2017 sales growth for established pharmaceuticals' other emerging markets includes the unfavorable impact of venezuelan operations. excluding venezuela and the effect of foreign exchange, sales in other emerging markets increased 7.5 percent in 2017.
total nutritional products sales increased 4.9 percent in 2018 and 0.6 percent in 2017, excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. the increases in 2018 and 2017 u.s. pediatric nutritional sales primarily reflect continued above-market performance in abbott's infant and toddler brands, including similac and pedialyte. 2018 international pediatric nutritional sales increased primarily due to growth in asia and latin america. the 2017 decrease in international pediatric nutritional sales was driven by challenging market conditions in the infant formula market in various emerging markets, partially offset by growth in china and india.
the 2018 sales increase in the international adult nutritional business was led by growth of ensure, abbott's market-leading complete and balanced nutrition brand, and glucerna, abbott's market-leading diabetes-specific nutrition brand in asia and latin america. u.s. adult nutritional business sales decreased in 2018 primarily driven by the wind down of a non-core product line. excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, the 2017 increase in international adult nutritional sales was due primarily to growth in ensure, as well as volume growth in emerging markets and continued expansion of the adult nutrition category internationally. u.s. adult nutritional revenues decreased in 2017 due to competitive and market dynamics.
total diagnostic products sales increased 33.6 percent in 2018 and 16.7 percent in 2017, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. the sales increases in 2018 and 2017 included the acquisition of alere, which was completed on october 3, 2017. excluding the impact of the acquisition, as well as the impact of foreign exchange, sales in the diagnostic products segment in 2018 and 2017 increased 6.5 and 5.5 percent, respectively. the 2018 increase in sales was primarily driven by above-market growth in core laboratory in the u.s. and internationally. in 2018, abbott accelerated the roll out of its alinity systems for core laboratory in europe. the 2017 increase in sales was primarily driven by share gains in the core laboratory markets globally, as well as performance in point of care led by the continued adoption of abbott's i-stat® handheld system.
excluding the effect of foreign exchange, total cardiovascular and neuromodulation products sales grew 4.9 percent in 2018. the 2018 sales increase was driven by growth in several areas, including double-digit growth in electrophysiology and structural heart.
the growth in electrophysiology in 2018 was led by higher sales in cardiac mapping and ablation catheters, as well as the u.s. launch of abbott's confirm rx® insertable cardiac monitor (icm), the world's first and only smartphone-compatible icm designed to help physicians remotely identify cardiac arrhythmias. in may 2018, abbott announced u.s. fda clearance of the advisor hd grid mapping catheter, sensor enabled, which creates detailed maps of the heart and expands abbott's electrophysiology product portfolio.
growth in structural heart in 2018 was driven by several product areas including the mitraclip, abbott's market-leading device for the minimally-invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation and the amplatzer® pfo occluder, a device designed to close a hole-like opening in the heart. in july 2018, abbott announced u.s. fda approval for a next-generation version of mitraclip. in september 2018, abbott announced positive clinical results from its coapt study, which demonstrated that mitraclip improved survival and clinical outcomes for select patients with functional mitral regurgitation. in the fourth quarter of 2018, the coapt study data was submitted to the u.s. fda to request approval of an expanded indication for mitraclip.
the growth in neuromodulation in 2018 reflects higher revenue for various products for the treatment of chronic pain and movement disorders.
in vascular, growth in imaging, vessel closure and other endovascular revenues in 2018 was partially offset by lower des sales due to lower u.s. market share and price erosion in various markets. during the second quarter of 2018, abbott received approval from the u.s. fda for the xience sierra drug eluting stent system, the newest generation of its coronary stent system. during the second quarter of 2018, the xience sierra drug eluting stent system also received national reimbursement in japan to treat people with coronary artery disease. in rhythm management, market share gains in the new patient segment were offset by replacement cycle dynamics. in heart failure, international sales growth was offset by lower u.s. sales. in october 2018, the heartmate 3 left ventricular assist device (lvad) received u.s. fda approval as a destination therapy for people living with advanced heart failure.
in 2017, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, total cardiovascular and neuromodulation products sales grew 207.4 percent. the increase in sales was primarily driven by the acquisition of st. jude medical which was completed on january 4, 2017. excluding the impact of the acquisition, as well as the impact of foreign exchange, sales in the vascular business were essentially flat in 2017 versus the prior year as lower coronary stent sales and the comparison impact from the favorable 2016 resolution of a third-party royalty agreement were offset by higher structural heart and endovascular sales.
abbott has periodically sold product rights to non-strategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with abbott's revenue recognition policies as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. related net sales were not significant in 2018, 2017 and 2016.
in april 2017, abbott received a warning letter from the u.s. fda related to its manufacturing facility in sylmar, ca which was acquired by abbott on january 4, 2017 as part of the acquisition of st. jude medical. this facility manufactures implantable cardioverter defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators, and monitors. the warning letter relates to the fda's observations from an inspection of this facility. abbott has prepared a comprehensive plan of corrective actions which has been provided to the fda. execution of the plan is progressing.
operating earnings gross profit margins were 51.3 percent of net sales in 2018, 47.5 percent in 2017 and 53.8 percent in 2016. in 2018, the increase primarily reflects lower inventory step-up amortization related to the st. jude medical and alere acquisitions and margin improvements in various businesses, partially offset by higher intangible amortization expense. in 2017, the decrease primarily reflects higher intangible amortization expense and inventory step-up amortization related to the st. jude medical and alere acquisitions, partially offset by margin improvements in various businesses.
research and development expense was $2.3 billion in 2018, $2.3 billion in 2017, and $1.4 billion in 2016 and represented a 1.7 percent increase in 2018, and a 56.2 percent increase in 2017. the 2018 increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher spending on various projects, partially offset by lower restructuring and integration costs. the 2017 increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to the acquisition of the st. jude medical business. in 2018, research and development expenditures totaled $1.0 billion for the cardiovascular and neuromodulation products segment, $585 million for the diagnostic products segment, $198 million for the nutritional products segment and $184 million for the established pharmaceutical products segment.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6.1 percent in 2018 and 36.3 percent in 2017 versus the respective prior year. the 2018 increase was primarily due to the impact of the acquisition of the alere business in october 2017, as well as higher spending to drive continued growth and market expansion in various businesses, partially offset by lower acquisition-related expenses. the 2017 increase was primarily due to the acquisition of the st. jude medical business, as well as the incremental expenses to integrate st. jude medical with abbott's existing vascular business, partially offset by the impact of cost improvement initiatives across various functions and businesses.
business acquisitions on january 4, 2017, abbott completed the acquisition of st. jude medical, a global medical device manufacturer, for approximately $23.6 billion, including approximately $13.6 billion in cash and approximately $10 billion in abbott common shares, which represented approximately 254 million shares of abbott common stock, based on abbott's closing stock price on the acquisition date. as part of the acquisition, approximately $5.9 billion of st. jude medical's debt was assumed, repaid or refinanced by abbott. the acquisition provides expanded opportunities for future growth and is an important part of the company's ongoing effort to develop a strong, diverse portfolio of devices, diagnostics, nutritionals and branded generic pharmaceuticals. the combined business competes in nearly every area of the cardiovascular device market, as well as in the neuromodulation market.
under the terms of the agreement, for each st. jude medical common share, st. jude medical shareholders received $46.75 in cash and 0.8708 of an abbott common share. at an abbott stock price of $39.36, which reflected the closing price on january 4, 2017, this represented a value of approximately $81 per st. jude medical common share and total purchase consideration of $23.6 billion. the cash portion of the acquisition was funded through a combination of medium and long-term debt issued in november 2016 and a $2.0 billion 120-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility which was subsequently repaid.
the final allocation of the fair value of the st. jude medical acquisition is shown in the table below.

the goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies from combining operations, as well as intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. the goodwill is identifiable to the cardiovascular and neuromodulation products reportable segment. the acquired tangible assets consist primarily of trade accounts receivable of approximately $1.1 billion, inventory of approximately $1.7 billion, other current assets of $176 million, property and equipment of approximately $1.5 billion, and other long-term assets of approximately $455 million. the acquired tangible liabilities consist of trade accounts payable and other current liabilities of approximately $1.1 billion and other non-current liabilities of approximately $870 million.
in 2016, abbott and st. jude medical agreed to sell certain businesses to terumo corporation for approximately $1.12 billion. the sale included the st. jude medical angio-seal and femoseal vascular closure and abbott's vado® steerable sheath businesses. the sale closed on january 20, 2017 and no gain or loss was recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings.
on october 3, 2017, abbott acquired alere, a diagnostic device and service provider, for $51.00 per common share in cash, which equated to a purchase price of approximately $4.5 billion. as part of the acquisition, abbott tendered for alere's preferred shares for a total value of approximately $0.7 billion. in addition, approximately $3.0 billion of alere's debt was assumed and subsequently repaid. the acquisition establishes abbott as a leader in point of care testing, expands abbott's global diagnostics presence and provides access to new products, channels and geographies. abbott utilized a combination of cash on hand and debt to fund the acquisition. see note 11  debt and lines of credit for further details regarding the debt utilized for the acquisition.

the goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies from combining operations, as well as intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. the goodwill is identifiable to the diagnostic products reportable segment. the approximate value of the acquired tangible assets consists of $430 million of trade accounts receivable, $425 million of inventory, $225 million of other current assets, $540 million of property and equipment, and $210 million of other long-term assets. the approximate value of the acquired tangible liabilities consists of $675 million of trade accounts payable and other current liabilities and $145 million of other non-current liabilities.
in the third quarter of 2017, alere entered into agreements to sell its triage meterpro cardiovascular and toxicology business and the assets and liabilities related to its b-type natriuretic peptide assay business run on beckman coulter analyzers to quidel corporation (quidel). the transactions with quidel reflect a total purchase price of $400 million payable at the close of the transaction, $240 million payable in six annual installments beginning approximately six months after the close of the transaction, and contingent consideration with a maximum value of $40 million. in the third quarter of 2017, alere entered into an agreement with siemens diagnostics holding ii b.v. (siemens) to sell its subsidiary, epocal inc., for approximately $200 million payable at the close of the transaction. alere agreed to divest these businesses in connection with the review by the federal trade commission and the european commission of abbott's agreement to acquire alere. the sale to quidel closed on october 6, 2017, and the sale to siemens closed on october 31, 2017. no gain or loss on these sales was recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings.
on july 17, 2017, abbott commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash the 1.77 million outstanding shares of alere's series b convertible perpetual preferred stock at a price of $402 per share, plus accrued but unpaid dividends to, but not including, the settlement date of the tender offer. this tender offer was subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including abbott's acquisition of alere and upon there being validly tendered (and not properly withdrawn) at the expiration date of the tender offer that number of shares of preferred stock that equaled at least a majority of the preferred stock issued and outstanding at the expiration of the tender offer. all conditions to the offer were satisfied and abbott accepted for payment the 1.748 million shares of preferred stock that were validly tendered (and not properly withdrawn). the remaining shares were cashed out for an amount equal to the $400.00 per share liquidation preference of such shares, plus accrued but unpaid dividends, without interest. payment for all of the shares of preferred stock was made in the fourth quarter of 2017.
restructurings in 2017 and 2018, abbott management approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisition of st. jude medical into the cardiovascular and neuromodulation products segment and alere into the diagnostic products segment, in order to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs. abbott recorded charges, including one-time employee termination benefits, of approximately $52 million in 2018 and $187 million in 2017. approximately $5 million in 2018 and 2017 are recorded in cost of products sold, approximately $10 million in 2018 is recorded in research and development and approximately $37 million in 2018 and $182 million in 2017 in selling, general and administrative expense.
from 2016 to 2018, abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in various abbott businesses including the nutritional, established pharmaceuticals and vascular businesses. abbott recorded employee-related severance and other charges of approximately $28 million in 2018, $120 million in 2017 and $32 million in 2016. approximately $10 million in 2018, $7 million in 2017 and $9 million in 2016 are recorded in cost of products sold, approximately $2 million in 2018, $77 million in 2017 and $5 million in 2016 are recorded in research and development and approximately $16 million in 2018, $36 million in 2017 and $18 million in 2016 are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. additional charges of approximately $2 million in 2017 and 2016 were recorded primarily for accelerated depreciation.
in 2018, interest expense decreased primarily due to the net repayment of $8.3 billion of debt, partially offset by lower interest income due to lower cash balances. in 2017, interest expense increased primarily due to the $15.1 billion of debt issued in november of 2016 related to the financing of the st. jude medical acquisition which closed on january 4, 2017. in 2016, interest expense increased primarily due to the amortization of bridge financing fees related to the financing of the st. jude medical and alere acquisitions. interest expense in 2016 also increased due to the $15.1 billion of debt issued in november 2016.
debt extinguishment costs on october 28, 2018, abbott redeemed approximately $4 billion of debt, which included $750 million principal amount of its 2.00% notes due 2020; $597 million principal amount of its 4.125% notes due 2020; $900 million principal amount of its 3.25% notes due 2023; $450 million principal amount of its 3.4% notes due 2023; and $1.300 billion principal amount of its 3.75% notes due 2026. abbott incurred a net charge of $153 million related to the early repayment of this debt and the unwinding of related interest rate swaps.
on march 22, 2018, abbott redeemed all of the $947 million principal amount of its 5.125% notes due 2019, as well as $1.055 billion of the $2.850 billion principal amount of its 2.35% notes due 2019. abbott incurred a net charge of $14 million related to the early repayment of this debt.
other (income) expense, net other (income) expense, net, for 2018, 2017 and 2016 includes approximately $160 million of income in each year related to the non-service cost components of the net periodic benefit costs associated with the pension and post-retirement medical plans. these amounts are being reported in other (income) expense as a result of the adoption of the new accounting standard for recognizing pension cost. 2017 includes a pre-tax gain of $1.163 billion on the sale of amo to johnson & johnson. 2016 includes $947 million of expense to adjust abbott's holding of mylan n.v. ordinary shares due to a decline in the fair value of the securities which was considered by abbott to be other than temporary.
the tax cuts and jobs act (tcja) was enacted in the u.s. on december 22, 2017. the tcja reduces the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. as of december 31, 2018, abbott has completed its accounting for all of the enactment date income tax effects of the tcja. if additional regulations issued by the u.s. department of the treasury after december 31, 2018 result in a change in judgment, the effect of such regulations will be accounted for in the period in which the regulations are finalized.
effective for fiscal years beginning after december 31, 2017, the tcja subjects taxpayers to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (gilti) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. in january 2018, the financial accounting standards board staff provided guidance that an entity may make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes related to items that will give rise to gilti in future years or provide for the tax expense related to gilti in the year that the tax is incurred. abbott has elected to treat the gilti tax as a period expense and provide for the tax in the year that the tax is incurred.
in the fourth quarter of 2017, abbott recorded an estimate of net tax expense of $1.46 billion for the impact of the tcja, which was included in taxes on earnings from continuing operations in the consolidated statement of earnings. the estimate was provisional and included a charge of approximately $2.89 billion for the transition tax, partially offset by a net benefit of approximately $1.42 billion for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and a net benefit of approximately $10 million related to certain other impacts of the tcja. in 2018, abbott recorded $130 million of additional tax expense which increased the final tax expense related to the tcja to $1.59 billion. the $130 million of additional tax expense reflects a $120 million increase in the transition tax from $2.89 billion to $3.01 billion and a $10 million reduction in the net benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
the one-time transition tax is based on abbott's total post-1986 earnings and profits (e&p) that were previously deferred from u.s. income taxes. the tax computation also requires the determination of the amount of post-1986 e&p considered held in cash and other specified assets. as of december 31, 2018, the remaining balance of abbott's transition tax obligation is approximately $1.58 billion, which will be paid over the next eight years as allowed by the tcja.
in 2018, taxes on earnings from continuing operations included $98 million of net tax expense related to the settlement of abbott's 2014-2016 federal income tax audit in the u.s., partial settlement of the former st. jude medical consolidated group's 2014 and 2015 federal income tax returns in the u.s. and audit settlements in various countries. in 2017, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include $435 million of tax expense related to the gain on the sale of the amo business. in 2016, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include the impact of a net tax benefit of approximately $225 million, primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions from prior years, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of non-deductible foreign exchange losses related to venezuela and the adjustment of the mylan n.v. equity investment, as well as the recognition of deferred taxes associated with the then pending sale of amo.
exclusive of these discrete items, tax expense was favorably impacted by lower tax rates and tax exemptions on foreign income primarily derived from operations in puerto rico, switzerland, ireland, the netherlands, costa rica, and singapore. abbott benefits from a combination of favorable statutory tax rules, tax rulings, grants, and exemptions in these tax jurisdictions. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for a full reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the u.s. federal statutory rate.
discontinued operations earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax of $34 million, $124 million and $321 million, in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were driven primarily by the recognition of net tax benefits as a result of the resolution of various tax positions pertaining to abbvie's operations for years prior to the separation. on january 1, 2013, abbott completed the separation of abbvie inc. (abbvie), which was formed to hold abbott's research-based proprietary pharmaceuticals business. abbott has retained all liabilities for all u.s. federal and foreign income taxes on income prior to the separation, as well as certain non-income taxes attributable to abbvie's business. abbvie generally will be liable for all other taxes attributable to its business.
assets held for disposition in september 2016, abbott announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to sell abbott medical optics (amo), its vision care business, to johnson & johnson for $4.325 billion in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments for cash, debt and working capital. the decision to sell amo reflected abbott's proactive shaping of its portfolio in line with its strategic priorities. in february 2017, abbott completed the sale of amo to johnson & johnson and recognized a pre-tax gain of $1.163 billion including working capital adjustments, which was reported in the other (income) expense, net line of the consolidated statement of earnings in 2017. abbott recorded an after-tax gain of $728 million in 2017 related to the sale of amo. the operating results of amo up to the date of sale continued to be included in earnings from continuing operations as the business did not qualify for reporting as discontinued operations. for 2017 and 2016, the amo earnings (losses) before taxes included in abbott's consolidated earnings were $(18) million and $30 million, respectively.
as discussed in the business acquisitions section, in conjunction with the acquisition of alere, abbott sold the triage meterpro cardiovascular and toxicology business and the assets and liabilities related to its b-type natriuretic peptide assay business run on beckman coulter analyzers to quidel. the legal transfer of certain assets related to these businesses did not occur at the close of the sale to quidel due to, among other factors, the time required to transfer marketing authorizations and other regulatory requirements in various countries. under the terms of the sale agreement with abbott, quidel is subject to the risks and entitled to the benefits generated by these operations and assets. the assets presented as held for disposition in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, primarily relate to the businesses sold to quidel.
the following is a summary of the assets held for disposition as of december 31, 2018 and 2017:
current assets held for disposition           9           20
intangible assets, net of amortization                   18
non-current assets held for disposition       17          176
total assets held for disposition             $26         $196
research and development programs abbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical, medical devices, diagnostic and nutritional products in development.
research and development process in the established pharmaceuticals segment, the development process focuses on the geographic expansion and continuous improvement of the segment's existing products to provide benefits to patients and customers. as established pharmaceuticals does not actively pursue primary research, development usually begins with work on existing products or after the acquisition of an advanced stage licensing opportunity.
depending upon the product, the phases of development may include:
 drug product development.
 phase i bioequivalence studies to compare a future established pharmaceutical's brand with an already marketed compound with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient (api).
 phase ii studies to test the efficacy of benefits in a small group of patients.
 phase iv and other post-marketing studies to obtain new clinical use data on existing products within approved indications.
the specific requirements (e.g., scope of clinical trials) for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions. the process may range from one year for a bioequivalence study project to 6 or more years for complex formulations, new indications, or geographic expansion in specific countries, such as china.
in the diagnostics segment, the phases of the research and development process include:
 discovery which focuses on identification of a product that will address a specific therapeutic area, platform, or unmet clinical need.
 concept/feasibility during which the materials and manufacturing processes are evaluated, testing may include product characterization and analysis is performed to confirm clinical utility.
 development during which extensive testing is performed to demonstrate that the product meets specified design requirements and that the design specifications conform to user needs and intended uses.
the regulatory requirements for diagnostic products vary across different countries and geographic regions. in the u.s., the fda classifies diagnostic products into classes (i, ii, or iii) and the classification determines the regulatory process for approval. while the diagnostics segment has products in all three classes, the vast majority of its products are categorized as class i or class ii. submission of a separate regulatory filing is not required for class i products. class ii devices typically require pre-market notification to the fda through a regulatory filing known as a 510(k) submission. most class iii products are subject to the fda's pre-marketing approval (pma) requirements. other class iii products, such as those used to screen blood, require the submission and approval of a biological license application (bla).
in the european union (eu), diagnostic products are also categorized into different categories and the regulatory process, which is governed by the european in vitro diagnostic medical device directive, depends upon the category. certain product categories require review and approval by an independent company, known as a notified body, before the manufacturer can affix a ce mark to the product to show compliance with the directive. other products only require a self-certification process.
in the cardiovascular and neuromodulation segment, the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability. if the research program passes that hurdle, it moves forward into development. the development process includes evaluation, selection and qualification of a product design, completion of applicable clinical trials to test the product's safety and efficacy, and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet pre-determined specifications.
similar to the diagnostic products discussed above, in the u.s., cardiovascular and neuromodulation products are classified as class i, ii, or iii. most of abbott's cardiovascular and neuromodulation products are classified as class ii devices that follow the 510(k) regulatory process or class iii devices that are subject to the pma process.
in the eu, cardiovascular and neuromodulation products are also categorized into different classes and the regulatory process, which is governed by the european medical device directive and the active implantable medical device directive, varies by class. each product must bear a ce mark to show compliance with the directive. some products require submission of a design dossier to the appropriate regulatory authority for review and approval prior to ce marking of the device. for other products, the company is required to prepare a technical file which includes testing results and clinical evaluations but can self-certify its ability to apply the ce mark to the product. outside the u.s. and the eu, the regulatory requirements vary across different countries and regions.
after approval and commercial launch of some cardiovascular and neuromodulation products, post-market trials may be conducted either due to a conditional requirement of the regulatory market approval or with the objective of proving product superiority.
in the second quarter of 2017, the eu adopted the new medical devices regulation (mdr) and the in vitro diagnostic regulation (ivdr) which replace the existing directives in the eu for medical devices and in vitro diagnostic products. the mdr and ivdr will apply after a three-year and five-year transition period, respectively, and will impose additional premarket and postmarket regulatory requirements on manufacturers of such products.
in the nutritional segment, the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations (e.g., infants and adults) or patients (e.g., people with diabetes). depending upon the country and/or region, if claims regarding a product's efficacy will be made, clinical studies typically must be conducted.
in the u.s., the fda requires that it be notified of proposed new formulations and formulation or packaging changes related to infant formula products. prior to the launch of an infant formula or product packaging change, the company is required to obtain the fda's confirmation that it has no objections to the proposed product or packaging. for other nutritional products, notification or pre-approval from the fda is not required unless the product includes a new food additive. in some countries, regulatory approval may be required for certain nutritional products, including infant formula and medical nutritional products.
areas of focus in 2019 and beyond, abbott's significant areas of therapeutic focus will include the following:
established pharmaceuticals  abbott focuses on building country-specific portfolios made up of high-quality medicines that meet the needs of people in emerging markets. over the next several years, abbott plans to expand its product portfolio in key therapeutic areas with the aim of being among the first to launch new off-patent and differentiated medicines. in addition, abbott continues to expand existing brands into new markets, implement product enhancements that provide value to patients and acquire strategic products and technology through licensing activities. abbott is also actively working on the further development of several key brands such as creon, duphaston, duphalac and influvac. depending on the product, the activities focus on development of new data, markets, formulations, delivery systems, or indications.
cardiovascular and neuromodulation  abbott's research and development programs focus on:
 cardiac rhythm management  development of next-generation rhythm management technologies, including enhanced patient engagement and expanded magnetic resonance (mr)-compatibility.
 heart failure  continued enhancements to abbott's left ventricular assist systems and pulmonary artery heart failure system, including enhanced connectivity, user-interfaces and remote patient monitoring.
 electrophysiology  development of next-generation technologies in the areas of ablation, diagnostic, mapping and visualization and recording and monitoring.
 vascular  development of next-generation technologies for use in coronary and peripheral vascular procedures.
 structural heart  development of minimally-invasive devices for the repair and replacement of heart valves and other structural heart conditions.
 neuromodulation  development of next-generation technologies with enhanced patient and physician engagement and expanded mr-compatibility to treat chronic pain, movement disorders and other indications.
diabetes care  develop enhancements and additional indications for the freestyle libre continuous glucose monitoring system to help patients improve their ability to manage diabetes.
core laboratory diagnostics  abbott continues to commercialize its next-generation blood screening, immunoassay, clinical chemistry and hematology systems, along with assays, including a focus on unmet medical need, in various areas including infectious disease, cardiac care, metabolics, oncology, as well as informatics and automation solutions to increase efficiency in laboratories.
molecular diagnostics  several new molecular in vitro diagnostic (ivd) tests and "alinity m", a next generation instrument system, are in various stages of development and launch.
rapid diagnostics  abbott's research and development programs focus on the development of diagnostic products for cardiometabolic disease, infectious disease and toxicology.
nutritionals  abbott is focusing its research and development spend on platforms that span the pediatric and adult nutrition areas: gastro intestinal/immunity health, brain health, mobility and metabolism, and user experience platforms. numerous new products that build on advances in these platforms are currently under development, including clinical outcome testing, and are expected to be launched over the coming years.
given the diversity of abbott's business, its intention to remain a broad-based healthcare company and the numerous sources for potential future growth, no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years. factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to abbott's total research and development expenses, as well as qualitative factors, such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on abbott's overall market position. there were no delays in abbott's 2018 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations.
while the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material, the total cost to complete will depend upon abbott's ability to successfully finish each project, the rate at which each project advances, and the ultimate timing for completion. given the potential for significant delays and the risk of failure inherent in the development of medical device, diagnostic and pharmaceutical products and technologies, it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development. abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spending that will be competitive in each of the businesses in which it participates, and such spending is expected to approximate 7.5 percent of total abbott sales in 2019. abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period.
goodwill at december 31, 2018, goodwill recorded as a result of business combinations totaled $23.3 billion. goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in the third quarter or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs, using a quantitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. the income and market approaches are used to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit. the results of the last impairment test indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value.
financial condition cash flow net cash from operating activities amounted to $6.3 billion, $5.6 billion and $3.2 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the increase in net cash from operating activities in 2018 was primarily due to higher segment operating earnings, continued improvements in working capital management, timing of pension contributions and lower acquisition-related expenses. the increase in net cash from operating activities in 2017 was primarily due to the favorable impact of improved working capital management, the acquisition of the st. jude medical businesses, and higher segment operating earnings. the income tax component of cash from operating activities in 2018 includes the non-cash impact of the $120 million adjustment to the transition tax associated with the tcja. the income tax component of operating cash flow in 2017 includes the non-cash impact of $1.46 billion of net tax expense related to the estimated impact of the tcja. the income tax component of operating cash flow in 2016 includes $550 million of non-cash tax benefits primarily related to the favorable resolution of various tax positions pertaining to prior years.
the foreign currency loss related to venezuela reduced abbott's cash by approximately $410 million in 2016 and is included in the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents line within the consolidated statement of cash flows. future fluctuations in the strength of the u.s. dollar against foreign currencies are not expected to materially impact abbott's liquidity.
while a significant portion of abbott's cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2018, are reinvested in foreign subsidiaries, abbott does not expect such reinvestment to affect its liquidity and capital resources. due to the enactment of the tcja, if these funds were needed for operations in the u.s., abbott does not expect to incur significant additional income taxes in the future to repatriate these funds.
abbott funded $114 million in 2018, $645 million in 2017 and $582 million in 2016 to defined benefit pension plans. abbott expects pension funding of approximately $380 million in 2019 for its pension plans. abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed abbott's capital expenditures and cash dividends.
debt and capital at december 31, 2018, abbott's long-term debt rating was bbb by standard & poor's corporation and baa1 by moody's. abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating.
abbott has readily available financial resources, including unused lines of credit that support commercial paper borrowing arrangements and provide abbott with the ability to borrow up to $5 billion on an unsecured basis. the lines of credit are part of a 2018 revolving credit agreement that expires in 2023. abbott entered into this new revolving credit agreement and terminated the 2014 revolving credit agreement on november 30, 2018. there were no outstanding borrowings under the 2014 revolving credit agreement at the time of its termination. any borrowings under the new revolving credit agreement will bear interest, at abbott's option, based on either a base rate or eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin based on abbott's credit ratings.
in conjunction with the funding of the st. jude medical and alere acquisitions and the assumption of st. jude medical's and alere's existing debt, abbott's total short-term and long-term debt increased from approximately $9.0 billion at december 31, 2015 to $27.9 billion at december 31, 2017. the increase in debt included the following transactions in 2016 and 2017:
 in april 2016, abbott obtained a commitment for a 364-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility for an amount not to exceed
$17.2 billion, comprised of $15.2 billion for a 364-day bridge loan and $2.0 billion for a 120-day bridge loan to provide financing for the acquisition of st. jude medical.
this facility has been terminated as further discussed below.
 in november 2016, abbott issued $15.1 billion of medium and long-term debt to primarily fund the cash portion of the acquisition of st. jude medical. abbott also entered into interest rate swap contracts totaling $3.0 billion related to the new debt. the swaps have the effect of changing abbott's obligation from a fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate obligation on the related debt instruments. the $15.2 billion component of the commitment for a bridge term loan facility terminated in november
 in december 2016, abbott formalized the $2.0 billion component of the bridge term loan facility and entered into a 120-day bridge term loan facility that provided abbott the ability to borrow up to $2.0 billion on an unsecured basis to partially fund the st. jude medical acquisition. on january 4, 2017, as part of funding the cash portion of the st. jude medical acquisition, abbott borrowed $2.0 billion under the 120-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility. this facility was repaid during the first quarter of 2017.
 in the first quarter of 2017, as part of the acquisition of st. jude medical, approximately $5.9 billion of st. jude medical's debt was assumed, repaid, or refinanced by abbott. this included the exchange of certain st. jude medical debt obligations with an aggregate principal amount of approximately
$2.9 billion for approximately $2.9 billion of debt issued by abbott. following this exchange, approximately $194.2 million of existing st. jude medical notes remained outstanding. there were no significant costs associated with the exchange of this debt. in addition, during the first quarter of 2017, abbott assumed and subsequently repaid approximately
 in 2017, abbott borrowed $2.8 billion on an unsecured basis under a 5-year term loan agreement and borrowed $1.7 billion under its lines of credit. proceeds from such borrowings were used to finance the acquisition of alere, to repay certain indebtedness of abbott and alere, and to pay fees and expenses in connection with the acquisition. the borrowings bore interest based on a eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin based on abbott's credit ratings. abbott paid off the term loan in january 2018, ahead of its 2022 due date and paid off $550 million of the line of credit in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the remaining $1.15 billion on january 5, 2018. in the fourth quarter of 2017, in conjunction with the acquisition of alere, abbott assumed and subsequently repaid $3.0 billion of alere's debt.
in 2018 abbott committed to reducing its debt levels and on february 16, 2018, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. redemptions under this authorization during 2018 included $0.947 billion principal amount of its 5.125% notes due 2019 and $2.850 billion principal amount of its 2.35% notes due 2019. abbott incurred a net charge of $14 million related to the early repayment of this debt.
on september 17, 2018, abbott repaid upon maturity the $500 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2.00% senior notes due 2018.
on october 28, 2018, abbott redeemed $4.0 billion principal amount of its outstanding long-term debt. this amount is in addition to the $5 billion authorization discussed above. in conjunction with the redemption, abbott unwound approximately $1.1 billion in interest rate swaps relating to the 3.40% note due in 2023 and the 3.75% note due in 2026. abbott incurred a net charge of $153 million related to the early repayment of this debt and the unwinding of related interest rate swaps.
the 2018 transactions described above, including the repayment of $2.8 billion under the 5-year term loan and $1.15 billion of borrowings under the lines of credit, resulted in the net repayment of approximately $8.3 billion of debt.
on january 25, 2019, abbott notified the holders of its 2.80% notes due 2020, that it will redeem the $500 million outstanding principal amount of these notes on february 24, 2019. after the redemption of the 2.80% notes, approximately $700 million of the $5 billion debt redemption authorized by abbott's board of directors in 2018 will remain available.
in september 2014, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of abbott's common shares from time to time. under the program authorized in 2014, abbott repurchased 36.2 million shares at a cost of $1.7 billion in 2015, 10.4 million shares at a cost of $408 million in 2016 and 1.9 million shares at a cost of $130 million in 2018 for a total of approximately $2.2 billion.
on april 27, 2016, the board of directors authorized the issuance and sale for general corporate purposes of up to 75 million common shares that would result in proceeds of up to $3 billion. no shares have been issued under this authorization.
abbott declared dividends of $1.16 per share in 2018 compared to $1.075 per share in 2017, an increase of approximately 8 percent. dividends paid were $1.974 billion in 2018 compared to $1.849 billion in 2017. the year-over-year change in dividends paid reflects the impact of the increase in the dividend rate.
working capital working capital was $5.6 billion at december 31, 2018 and $11.2 billion at december 31, 2017. the decrease in working capital in 2018 reflects the use of cash to repay long-term debt and dividends.
abbott monitors the credit worthiness of customers and establishes an allowance against a trade receivable when it is probable that the balance will not be collected. in addition to closely monitoring economic conditions and budgetary and other fiscal developments, abbott regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. abbott also monitors the potential for and periodically has utilized factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a material amount of total outstanding receivables.
venezuela operations since january 2010, venezuela has been designated as a highly inflationary economy under u.s. gaap. on february 17, 2016, the venezuelan government announced that its three-tier exchange rate system would be reduced to two rates renamed the dipro and dicom rates. the dipro was the official rate for food and medicine imports and was adjusted from 6.3 to 10 bolivars per u.s. dollar. the dicom rate was a floating market rate published daily by the venezuelan central bank, which at the end of the first quarter of 2016 was approximately 263 bolivars per u.s. dollar. as a result of decreasing government approvals to convert bolivars to u.s. dollars to pay for intercompany accounts, as well as the accelerating deterioration of economic conditions in the country, abbott concluded that it was appropriate to move to the dicom rate at the end of the first quarter of 2016. as a result, abbott recorded a foreign currency exchange loss of $480 million in 2016 to revalue its net monetary assets in venezuela. after the revaluation, abbott's investment in its venezuelan operations was not significant.
capital expenditures capital expenditures of $1.4 billion in 2018, $1.1 billion in 2017 and $1.1 billion in 2016 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing and research and development facilities and equipment in various segments, investments in information technology, and laboratory instruments placed with customers.
long-term debt, including current maturities       $19,626                     $7            $4,658            $3,105       $11,856

purchase commitments are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital expenditure requirements.
other long-term liabilities include estimated payments for the transition tax under the tcja, net of applicable credits.
net unrecognized tax benefits totaling approximately $465 million are excluded from the table above as abbott is unable to reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities on such items. see note 15  taxes on earnings from continuing operations for further the company has employee benefit obligations consisting of pensions and other post-employment benefits, including medical and life, which have been excluded from the table. a discussion of the company's pension and post-retirement plans, including funding matters is included in note 14  post-employment benefits.
contingent obligations abbott has periodically entered into agreements with other companies in the ordinary course of business, such as assignment of product rights, which has resulted in abbott becoming secondarily liable for obligations that abbott was previously primarily liable. since abbott no longer maintains a business relationship with the other parties, abbott is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments, if any, under these obligations. based upon past experience, the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote. in addition, abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events.
legislative issues abbott's primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world. abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. a more complete discussion of these factors is contained in item 1, business, and item 1a, risk factors.
recently issued accounting standards in february 2018, the fasb issued asu 2018-02, reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income, which allows companies to reclassify stranded tax effects resulting from the tcja, from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to retained earnings (earnings employed in the business). the standard would have become effective for abbott beginning in the first quarter of 2019, with early adoption permitted. abbott elected to adopt the new standard at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2018. as a result of the adoption of the new standard, approximately $337 million of stranded tax effects were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings employed in the business.
in august 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-12, targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities, which makes changes to the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results. the standard would have become effective for abbott beginning in the first quarter of 2019, with early adoption permitted. abbott elected to early adopt asu 2017-12 in the fourth quarter of 2018. the impact of adopting the standard is not significant to abbott's consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of earnings.
in march 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-07, compensation  retirement benefits (topic 715): improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost which changes the financial statement presentation requirements for pension and other postretirement benefit expense. while service cost continues to be reported in the same financial statement line items as other current employee compensation costs, the asu requires all other components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense to be presented separately from service cost, and outside any subtotal of income from operations. the standard was adopted by abbott beginning in the first quarter of 2018. the change in the presentation of the components of pension cost per year was applied retrospectively. as a result, approximately $160 million of net pension-related income per year was moved from the operating lines of the consolidated statement of earnings to non-operating income for 2017 and 2016.
in november 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-18, statement of cash flows: restricted cash, which requires that restricted cash be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. abbott adopted this standard beginning in the first quarter of 2018, and applied the guidance retrospectively to all periods presented. abbott did not have any restricted cash balances in the periods presented except for $75 million of restricted cash acquired as part of the alere acquisition in october 2017. the restrictions on this cash were eliminated prior to the end of 2017.
in october 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-16, income taxes (topic 740): intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory, which requires the recognition of the income tax effects of intercompany sales and transfers of assets, other than inventory, in the period in which the transfer occurs. abbott adopted the standard on january 1, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach and recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment to earnings employed in the business in the consolidated balance sheet that was not significant.
in august 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-15, statement of cash flows: classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments, which clarifies how companies should present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. the asu became effective for abbott in the first quarter of 2018 and did not have a material impact to the company's consolidated statement of cash flows.
in february 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-02, leases, which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases on the balance sheet. the standard becomes effective for abbott beginning in the first quarter of 2019. abbott completed a detailed review of its leases. abbott will use the modified retrospective approach with the package of practical expedients which allows abbott to carry forward the historical lease classification for existing or expired leases and to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for its lessee arrangements. abbott does not expect the new lease accounting standard to have a material impact on the amounts reported in the consolidated statement of earnings. as a result of adopting asu 2016-02, abbott expects to record approximately $800 million to $900 million of right of use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases on the consolidated balance sheet.
in january 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-01, financial instruments  recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, which provides new guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities. abbott adopted the standard on january 1, 2018. under the new standard, changes in the fair value of equity investments with readily determinable fair values are recorded in other (income) expense, net within the consolidated statement of earnings. previously, such fair value changes were recorded in other comprehensive income. abbott has elected the measurement alternative allowed by asu 2016-01 for its equity investments without readily determinable fair values. these investments are measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus any changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. changes in the measurement of these investments are being recorded in other (income) expense, net within the consolidated statement of earnings. as part of the adoption, the cumulative-effect adjustment to earnings employed in the business in the consolidated balance sheet for net unrealized losses on equity investments that were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of december 31, 2017 was not significant.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers, which provides a single comprehensive model for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers and supersedes nearly all previously existing revenue recognition guidance. the core principle of the asu is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. abbott adopted the new standard as of january 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective approach method. under this method, entities recognize the cumulative effect of applying the new standard at the date of initial application with no restatement of comparative periods presented. the cumulative effect of applying the new standard resulted in an increase to earnings employed in the business in the consolidated balance sheet of $23 million which was recorded on january 1, 2018. the new standard has been applied only to those contracts that were not completed as of january 1, 2018. the impact of adopting asu 2014-09 was not significant to individual financial statement line items in the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of earnings.
private securities litigation reform act of 1995  a caution concerning forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, abbott cautions investors that any forward-looking statements or projections made by abbott, including those made in this document, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect abbott's operations are discussed in item 1a, risk factors.
item 7a.    quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments and risk management market price sensitive investments the fair value of equity securities held by abbott with a readily determinable fair value was approximately $13 million and $11 million as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. these equity securities are subject to potential changes in fair value. a hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at december 31, 2018 by approximately $3 million. changes in the fair value of these securities are recorded in earnings. the fair value of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan was approximately $307 million and $363 million as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. changes in the fair value of these investments are recorded in earnings.
non-publicly traded equity securities abbott holds equity securities that are not traded on public stock exchanges. the carrying value of these investments was $211 million and $228 million as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. no individual investment is recorded at a value in excess of $61 million. abbott measures these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.
interest rate sensitive financial instruments at december 31, 2018 and 2017, abbott had interest rate hedge contracts totaling $2.9 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt. the effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate for the portion of the debt that is hedged. abbott does not use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities. the fair value of long-term debt at december 31, 2018 and 2017 amounted to $19.9 billion and $29.0 billion, respectively (average interest rates of 3.5% and 3.6% as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively) with maturities through 2046. at december 31, 2018 and 2017, the fair value of current and long-term investment securities amounted to approximately $1.1 billion. a hypothetical 100-basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows, income or fair values. (a 100-basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in rates.)
foreign currency sensitive financial instruments certain abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the u.s. dollar. these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are marked-to-market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). gains or losses will be included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally within the next twelve to eighteen months. at december 31, 2018 and 2017, abbott held $5.1 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, of such contracts. contracts held at december 31, 2018 will mature in 2019 or 2020 depending upon the contract. contracts held at december 31, 2017 matured in 2018 or will mature in 2019 depending upon the contract.
abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and third-party trade payables and receivables. the contracts are marked-to-market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. at december 31, 2018 and 2017, abbott held $13.6 billion and $20.1 billion, respectively, of such contracts, which mature in the next 24 months.
in march 2017, abbott repaid its $479 million foreign denominated short-term debt which was designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign subsidiary. at december 31, 2016, the value of this short-term debt was $454 million, and changes in the fair value of the debt up through the date of repayment due to changes in exchange rates were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.
the following table reflects the total foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at december 31, 2018 and 2017:
primarily u.s. dollars to be exchanged for the following currencies:

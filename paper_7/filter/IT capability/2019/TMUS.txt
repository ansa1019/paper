business overview un-carrier strategy we are the un-carrier. through our un-carrier strategy, we have disrupted the wireless communications services industry, rattling the status quo, by actively engaging with and listening to our customers and eliminating their existing pain points, including providing them with an unrivaled value, an exceptional experience and implementing signature un-carrier initiatives that have changed wireless for good.
proposed sprint transactions on april 29, 2018, we entered into the business combination agreement with sprint to merge in an all-stock transaction at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.10256 shares of t-mobile common stock for each share of sprint common stock, or 9.75 shares of sprint common stock for each share of t-mobile common stock. if the merger closes, the combined company will be named "t-mobile" and, as a result of the merger, is expected to be able to build upon our recently launched foundational 5g network 600 mhz spectrum to deliver transformational broad, deep and nationwide 5g for all, accelerate innovation and increase competition in the u.s. wireless, video and broadband industries. immediately following the merger, it is anticipated that dt and softbank group corp. ("softbank") will hold, directly or indirectly, on a fully diluted basis, approximately 41.5% and 27.2%, respectively, of the outstanding t-mobile common stock, with the remaining approximately 31.3% of the outstanding t-mobile common stock held by other stockholders, based on closing share prices and certain other assumptions as of december 31, 2019. the consummation of the merger remains subject to certain closing conditions. we expect the merger will be permitted to close in early 2020.
for more information regarding our business combination agreement, see note 2 - business combinations of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
5g launch in december 2019, t-mobile launched america's first nationwide 5g network, including prepaid 5g with metro by t-mobile, covering more than 200 million people and more than 5,000 cities and towns across the united states with 5g.
tvision home in april 2019, we introduced tvisiontm home, a rebranded and upgraded version of layer3 tv. tvisiontm home delivers what customers want most from high-end home tv, including a premium tv experience and hd and 4k channels. tvisiontm home launched in eight markets.
t-mobile money in april 2019, we launched t-mobile money nationwide, offering customers a no-fee, interest-earning, mobile-first checking account which can be opened and managed from customers' smartphones. accounts are held at bankmobile, a division of customers bank, member federal deposit insurance corporation.
our ability to acquire and retain branded customers is important to our business in the generation of revenues and we believe our un-carrier strategy, along with ongoing network improvements, has been successful in attracting and retaining customers as evidenced by continued branded customer growth and improved branded postpaid phone and branded prepaid customer churn.

guarantor subsidiaries pursuant to the applicable indentures and supplemental indentures, the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties issued by t-mobile usa ("issuer") is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by t-mobile
("parent") and certain of the issuer's 100% owned subsidiaries ("guarantor subsidiaries"). the financial condition and results of operations of the parent, issuer and guarantor subsidiaries is substantially similar to our consolidated financial condition. in 2019, certain non-guarantor subsidiaries became guarantor subsidiaries. certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentations. the most significant components of the financial condition of our non-guarantor subsidiaries were as follows:

year ended december 31,                                                     change the change to the results of operations of our non-guarantor subsidiaries was primarily from:
•higher service revenues, primarily due to an increase in activity of the non-guarantor subsidiary that provides premium services, primarily driven by a net increase in rates as well as growth in our customer base related to a premium service that launched at the end of august 2018 and sales of a new product; partially offset by
•higher cost of equipment sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily due to higher cost devices used for device insurance claims fulfillment, partially offset by an increase in device liquidations; and
•higher selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily due to higher costs related to outsourced functions.
all other results of operations of the parent, issuer and guarantor subsidiaries are substantially similar to the company's consolidated results of operations. see note 18 - guarantor financial information of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
performance measures in managing our business and assessing financial performance, we supplement the information provided by our financial statements with other operating or statistical data and non-gaap financial measures. these operating and financial measures are utilized by our management to evaluate our operating performance and, in certain cases, our ability to meet liquidity requirements. although companies in the wireless industry may not define each of these measures in precisely the same way, we believe that these measures facilitate comparisons with other companies in the wireless industry on key operating and financial measures.
total customers a customer is generally defined as a sim number with a unique t-mobile identifier which is associated with an account that generates revenue. branded customers generally include customers that are qualified either for postpaid service utilizing phones, wearables, digits or other connected devices which includes tablets and syncup drivetm, where they generally pay after receiving service, or prepaid service, where they generally pay in advance. our branded prepaid customers include customers of t-mobile and metro by t-mobile. wholesale customers include m2m and mvno customers that operate on our network but are managed by wholesale partners.
starting with the three months ended march 31, 2020, we plan to discontinue reporting wholesale customers and instead focus on branded customers and wholesale revenues, which we consider more relevant than the number of wholesale customers given the expansion of m2m and iot products.
on july 18, 2019, we entered into an agreement whereby certain t-mobile branded prepaid products will now be offered and distributed by a current mvno partner. upon the effective date, the agreement resulted in a base adjustment to reduce branded prepaid customers by 616,000, as we no longer actively support the branded product offering. prospectively, new customer activity associated with these products is recorded within wholesale customers and revenue for these customers is recorded within wholesale revenues in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

customers per account customers per account is calculated by dividing the number of branded postpaid customers as of the end of the period by the number of branded postpaid accounts as of the end of the period. an account may include branded postpaid phone customers and branded postpaid other customers which includes wearables, digits, and other connected devices such as tablets and syncup drivetm. we believe branded postpaid customers per account provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate our branded postpaid customer base.
the following table sets forth the branded postpaid customers per account:

branded postpaid customers per account increased 3% primarily from continued growth of new customer segments and rate plans such as unlimited 55+, military, business and essentials, promotional activities targeting families and the continued success of other connected devices and wearables, specifically tablets and the apple watch.
starting with the three months ended march 31, 2020, we plan to report average revenue per postpaid account or postpaid arpa, in addition to our existing arpu metrics, reflecting the increasing importance of non-phone devices to our customers. we also plan to discontinue reporting branded postpaid customers per account.
churn churn represents the number of customers whose service was disconnected as a percentage of the average number of customers during the specified period. the number of customers whose service was disconnected is presented net of customers that subsequently have their service restored within a certain period of time. we believe that churn provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate customer retention and loyalty.
the following table sets forth the churn:

branded prepaid churn decreased 14 basis points, primarily from increased customer satisfaction and loyalty from ongoing improvements to network quality and the continued success of our prepaid brands due to promotional activities and rate plan offers.
average revenue per user arpu represents the average monthly service revenue earned from customers. we believe arpu provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our service revenue per customer and assist in forecasting our future service revenues generated from our customer base. branded postpaid phone arpu excludes branded postpaid other customers and related revenues which includes wearables, digits and other connected devices such as tablets and syncup drivetm.

•the removal of certain branded prepaid customers associated with products now offered and distributed by a current mvno partner as those customers had lower arpu.
adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda represents earnings before interest expense, net of interest income, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation and certain income and expenses not reflective of our operating performance. net income margin represents net income divided by service revenues. adjusted ebitda margin represents adjusted ebitda divided by service revenues.
adjusted ebitda is a non-gaap financial measure utilized by our management to monitor the financial performance of our operations. we use adjusted ebitda internally as a measure to evaluate and compensate our personnel and management for their performance, and as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors. management believes analysts and investors use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to evaluate overall operating performance and facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications services companies because it is indicative of our ongoing operating performance and trends by excluding the impact of interest expense from financing, non-cash depreciation and amortization from capital investments, non-cash stock-based compensation, network decommissioning costs and costs related to the transactions, as they are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, as well as certain other nonrecurring income and expenses. adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations, net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap").
the following table illustrates the calculation of adjusted ebitda and reconciles adjusted ebitda to net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable gaap financial measure:

(1)stock-based compensation includes payroll tax impacts and may not agree to stock-based compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements. additionally, certain stock-based compensation expenses associated with the transactions have been included in merger-related costs.
(2)other, net may not agree to the consolidated statements of comprehensive income primarily due to certain non-routine operating activities, such as other special items that would not be expected to reoccur or are not reflective of t-mobile's ongoing operating performance, and are therefore excluded in adjusted ebitda.
adjusted ebitda increased $985 million, or 8%, primarily due to:
•the positive impact of the new lease standard of approximately $195 million; partially offset by
•higher selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding merger-related costs;
•the impact from hurricane-related reimbursements, net of costs, of $158 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. there were no significant impacts from hurricanes for the year ended december 31, 2019.
•the impact from commission costs capitalized and amortized beginning upon the adoption of asc 606 on january 1, 2018, reduced adjusted ebitda by $337 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, compared to year ended december 31, 2018.
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, proceeds from issuance of long-term debt and common stock, financing leases, the sale of certain receivables, financing arrangements of vendor payables which effectively extend payment terms and secured and unsecured revolving credit facilities with dt. upon consummation of the transactions, we will incur substantial third-party indebtedness which will increase our future financial commitments, including aggregate interest payments on higher total indebtedness, and may adversely impact our liquidity. further, the incurrence of additional indebtedness may inhibit our ability to incur new debt under the terms governing our existing and future indebtedness, which may make it more difficult for us to incur new debt in the future to finance our business strategy.
cash flows the following is a condensed schedule of our cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018:

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased $2.9 billion, or 75%, from:
•a $2.0 billion decrease in net cash outflows from changes in working capital, primarily due to lower use from accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and equipment installment plan receivables, partially offset by higher use from inventories; and with the adoption of the new lease standard, changes in operating lease right-of-use assets and short and long-term operating lease liabilities are now presented in changes in operating assets and liabilities. the net impact of changes in these accounts decreased net cash provided by operating activities by $235 million for the year ended december 31, 2019.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased $3.5 billion, or 612%. the use of cash for the year ended december 31, 2019, was primarily from:
•$6.4 billion in purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest, primarily driven by growth in network build as we continued deployment of low band spectrum, including 600 mhz, and launched our nationwide 5g network;
•$967 million in purchases of spectrum licenses and other intangible assets, including deposits; and
•$632 million in net cash related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange arrangements, see note 7 - fair value measurements of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information; partially offset by
•$3.9 billion in proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities decreased $1.0 billion, or 29%. the use of cash for the year ended december 31, 2019, was primarily from:
•$798 million for repayments of financing lease obligations;
•$775 million for repayments of short-term debt for purchases of inventory, property and equipment;
•$600 million for repayments of long-term debt; and
•$156 million for tax withholdings on share-based awards.
•activity under the revolving credit facility included borrowing and full repayment of $2.3 billion, for a net of $0 impact.
free cash flow free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less payments for purchases of property and equipment, including proceeds from sales of tower sites and proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions, less cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs. free cash flow is a non-gaap financial measure utilized by our management, investors and analysts of our financial information to evaluate cash available to pay debt and provide further investment in the business.
in 2019, we sold tower sites for proceeds of $38 million which are included in proceeds from sales of tower sites within net cash used in investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. as these proceeds were from the sale of fixed assets and are used by management to assess cash available for capital expenditures during the year, we determined the proceeds are relevant for the calculation of free cash flow and included them in the table below. other proceeds from the sale of fixed assets for the periods presented are not significant. we have presented the impact of the sales in the table below, which illustrates the calculation of free cash flow and reconciles free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, which we consider to be the most directly comparable gaap financial measure.

•higher net cash provided by operating activities, as described above; and
•lower cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; partially offset by
•lower proceeds related to our deferred purchase price from securitization transactions; and
•higher cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest of $473 million and $362 million for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
•free cash flow includes $442 million and $86 million in payments for merger-related costs for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
borrowing capacity and debt financing as of december 31, 2019, our total debt and financing lease liabilities were $27.3 billion, excluding our tower obligations, of which $24.9 billion was classified as long-term debt.
effective april 28, 2019, we redeemed $600 million aggregate principal amount of our dt senior reset notes. the notes were redeemed at a redemption price equal to 104.666% of the principal amount of the notes (plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon) and were paid on april 29, 2019. the redemption premium was $28 million and was included in other expense, net in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income and in cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
certain components of the reset features were required to be bifurcated from the dt senior reset notes and were separately accounted for as embedded derivatives. the write-off of embedded derivatives upon redemption resulted in a gain of $11 million, which was included in other expense, net in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. see note 7 - fair value measurements of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
we maintain a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility with dt which is comprised of a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement and a $1.5 billion secured revolving credit agreement. in december 2019, we amended the terms of the revolving credit facility with dt to extend the maturity date to december 29, 2022. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility.
we maintain a financing arrangement with deutsche bank ag, which allows for up to $108 million in borrowings. under the financing arrangement, we can effectively extend payment terms for invoices payable to certain vendors. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no outstanding balances.
we maintain vendor financing arrangements with our primary network equipment suppliers. under the respective agreements, we can obtain extended financing terms. during the year ended december 31, 2019, we utilized $800 million and repaid $775 million under the vendor financing arrangements. invoices subject to extended payment terms have various due dates through the first quarter of 2020. payments on vendor financing agreements are included in repayments of short-term debt for purchases of inventory, property and equipment, net, in our consolidated statements of cash flows. as of december 31, 2019, there were $25 million in outstanding borrowings under the vendor financing agreements which were included in short-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. as of december 31, 2018, there was no outstanding balance.
consents on debt on may 18, 2018, under the terms and conditions described in the consent solicitation statement dated as of may 14, 2018, we obtained consents necessary to effect certain amendments to certain of our existing debt and certain existing debt of our subsidiaries. if the merger is consummated, we will make payments for requisite consents to third-party note holders. there was no payment accrued as of december 31, 2019.
in connection with the entry into the business combination agreement, dt and t-mobile usa entered into a financing matters agreement, dated as of april 29, 2018, pursuant to which dt agreed, among other things, to consent to the incurrence by t-mobile usa of secured debt in connection with and after the consummation of the merger. if the merger is consummated, we will make payments for requisite consents to dt. there was no payment accrued as of december 31, 2019. see note 8 - debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
commitment letter in connection with the entry into the business combination agreement, t-mobile usa entered into a commitment letter, dated as of april 29, 2018 (as amended and restated on may 15, 2018 and on september 6, 2019, the "commitment letter"). in connection with the financing provided for in the commitment letter, we expect to incur certain fees payable to the financial institutions, including certain financing fees on the secured term loan commitment. if the merger closes, we will incur additional fees for the financial institutions structuring and providing the commitments and certain take-out fees associated with the issuance of permanent secured bond debt in lieu of the secured bridge loan. in total, we may incur up to approximately $340 million in fees associated with the commitment letter. we began incurring certain commitment letter fees on november 1, 2019, which were recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. there were $12 million of fees accrued as of december 31, 2019. see note 8 - debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
future sources and uses of liquidity we may seek additional sources of liquidity, including through the issuance of additional long-term debt in 2020, to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses or other assets in private party transactions or for the refinancing of existing long-term debt on an opportunistic basis. excluding liquidity that could be needed for spectrum acquisitions, or for other assets, we expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for business operations for the next 12 months as well as our longer-term liquidity needs. our intended use of any such funds is for general corporate purposes, including for capital expenditures, spectrum purchases, opportunistic investments and acquisitions, redemption of high yield callable debt and stock purchases.
in october 2018, we entered into interest rate lock derivatives with notional amounts of $9.6 billion. the fair value of interest rate lock derivatives was a liability of $1.2 billion and $447 million as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and was included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.
in november 2019, we extended the mandatory termination date on our interest rate lock derivatives to june 3, 2020. in december 2019, we made net collateral transfers to certain of our derivative counterparties totaling $632 million, which included variation margin transfers to (or from) such derivative counterparties based on daily market movements. these collateral transfers are included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and in net cash related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange arrangements within net cash used in investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. the interest rate lock derivatives will be settled upon the earlier of the issuance of fixed-rate debt or the current mandatory termination date. upon settlement of the interest rate lock derivatives, we will receive, or make, a cash payment in the amount of the fair value of the cash flow hedge as of the settlement date. we expect our existing sources of liquidity to be sufficient to meet the requirements of the interest rate lock derivatives.
we determine future liquidity requirements, for both operations and capital expenditures, based in large part upon projected financial and operating performance, and opportunities to acquire additional spectrum. we regularly review and update these projections for changes in current and projected financial and operating results, general economic conditions, the competitive landscape and other factors. there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial and operating results and capital requirements to differ materially from our projections, which could cause future liquidity to differ materially from our assessment.
the indentures and credit facilities governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding capital leases, contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the issuer and the guarantor subsidiaries to incur more debt, pay dividends and make distributions on our common stock, make certain investments, repurchase stock, create liens or other encumbrances, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries, and merge, consolidate or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. certain provisions of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties restrict the ability of the issuer to loan funds or make payments to the parent. however, the issuer is allowed to make certain permitted payments to the parent under the terms of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties. we were in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants as of december 31, 2019.
financing lease facilities we have entered into uncommitted financing lease facilities with certain partners, which provide us with the ability to enter into financing leases for network equipment and services. as of december 31, 2019, we have committed to $3.9 billion of financing leases under these financing lease facilities, of which $898 million was executed during the year ended december 31, 2019.
capital expenditures our liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses and the construction, expansion and upgrading of our network infrastructure. property and equipment capital expenditures primarily relate to our network transformation, including the build-out of our network to utilize our 600 mhz spectrum licenses and the deployment of 5g. we expect cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest of approximately $400 million, to be $5.9 to $6.2 billion and cash purchases of property and equipment, excluding capitalized interest, to be $5.5 to $5.8 billion in 2020. this includes expenditures for 600 mhz and 5g deployment. this does not include property and equipment obtained through financing lease agreements, vendor financing agreements, leased wireless devices transferred from inventory or any additional purchases of spectrum licenses.
share repurchases on december 6, 2017, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program for up to $1.5 billion of our common stock through december 31, 2018 (the "2017 stock repurchase program"). repurchased shares are retired. the 2017 stock repurchase program was completed on april 29, 2018.
on april 27, 2018, our board of directors authorized an increase in the total stock repurchase program to $9.0 billion, consisting of the $1.5 billion in repurchases previously completed and up to an additional $7.5 billion of repurchases of our common stock through the year ending december 31, 2020 (the "2018 stock repurchase program"). the additional $7.5 billion repurchase authorization is contingent upon the termination of the business combination agreement and the abandonment of the transactions contemplated under the business combination agreement. there were no repurchases of our common stock under the 2018 stock repurchase program in 2019 or 2018. see note 12 - repurchases of common stock of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
dividends we have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. our credit facilities and the indentures and supplemental indentures governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding financing leases, contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of december 31, 2019 and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods:
financing lease liabilities, including imputed interest                1,013                        1,147                        172                            115               2,447
operating lease liabilities, including imputed interest                2,754                        4,894                      3,523                          3,797              14,968
(1)represents principal amounts of long-term debt to affiliates and third parties at maturity, excluding unamortized premium from purchase price allocation fair value adjustment, financing lease obligations and vendor financing arrangements. see note 8 - debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
(2)future minimum payments, including principal and interest payments and imputed lease rental income, related to the tower obligations. see note 9 - tower obligations of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
(3)the minimum commitment for certain obligations is based on termination penalties that could be paid to exit the contracts. termination penalties are included in the above table as payments due as of the earliest we could exit the contract, typically in less than one year. for certain contracts that include fixed volume purchase commitments and fixed prices for various products, the purchase obligations are calculated using fixed volumes and contractually fixed prices for the products that are expected to be purchased. this table does not include open purchase orders as of december 31, 2019 under normal business purposes. see note 16 - commitments and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
certain commitments and obligations are included in the table based on the year of required payment or an estimate of the year of payment. other long-term liabilities have been omitted from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments, combined with the absence of historical trending to be used as a predictor of such payments. see note 17 - additional financial information of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
the purchase obligations reflected in the table above are primarily commitments to purchase and lease spectrum licenses, wireless devices, network services, equipment, software, marketing sponsorship agreements and other items in the ordinary course of business. these amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which we are contractually committed. where we are committed to make a minimum payment to the supplier regardless of whether we take delivery, we have included only that minimum payment as a purchase obligation. the acquisition of spectrum licenses is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.
in october 2018, we entered into interest rate lock derivatives with notional amounts of $9.6 billion. the fair value of interest rate lock derivatives was a liability of $1.2 billion and $447 million as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and was included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. balances related to the cash flow hedges have been omitted from the table above due to the uncertainty of the amount and timing of settlements. see note 7 - fair value measurements of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
related party transactions we have related party transactions associated with dt or its affiliates in the ordinary course of business, including intercompany servicing and licensing. see note 17 - additional financial information of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
disclosure of iranian activities under section 13(r) of the securities exchange act of 1934
section 219 of the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 added section 13(r) to the exchange act of 1934, as amended ("exchange act"). section 13(r) requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to iran or with designated natural persons or entities involved in terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. disclosure is required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted outside the u.s. by non-u.s. affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under u.s. law.
as of the date of this report, we are not aware of any activity, transaction or dealing by us or any of our affiliates for the year ended december 31, 2019, that requires disclosure in this report under section 13(r) of the exchange act, except as set forth below with respect to affiliates that we do not control and that are our affiliates solely due to their common control with dt. we have relied upon dt for information regarding their activities, transactions and dealings.
dt, through certain of its non-u.s. subsidiaries, is party to roaming and interconnect agreements with the following mobile and fixed line telecommunication providers in iran, some of which are or may be government-controlled entities: mtn irancell, telecommunication kish company, mobile telecommunication company of iran, and telecommunication infrastructure company of iran. in addition, during the year ended december 31, 2019, dt, through certain of its non-u.s. subsidiaries, provided basic telecommunications services to three customers in germany identified on the specially designated nationals and blocked persons list maintained by the u.s. department of treasury's office of foreign assets control: bank melli, bank sepah, and europäisch-iranische handelsbank. these services have been terminated or are in the process of being terminated. for the year ended december 31, 2019, gross revenues of all dt affiliates generated by roaming and interconnection traffic and telecommunications services with the iranian parties identified herein were less than $0.1 million, and the estimated net profits were less than $0.1 million.
in addition, dt, through certain of its non-u.s. subsidiaries that operate a fixed-line network in their respective european home countries (in particular germany), provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to the embassy of iran in those european countries. gross revenues and net profits recorded from these activities for the year ended december 31, 2019 were less than $0.1 million. we understand that dt intends to continue these activities.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have arrangements, as amended from time to time, to sell certain eip accounts receivable and service accounts receivable on a revolving basis as a source of liquidity. as of december 31, 2019, we derecognized net receivables of $2.6 billion upon sale through these arrangements. see note 4 - sales of certain receivables of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition as they require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
eight of these policies, discussed below, are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. actual results could differ from those estimates.
management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies.
leases we adopted the new lease standard on january 1, 2019 and recognized right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases that have not previously been recorded.
the most significant judgments and impacts upon adoption of the standard include the following:
•in evaluating contracts to determine if they qualify as a lease, we consider factors such as if we have obtained or transferred substantially all of the rights to the underlying asset through exclusivity, if we can or if we have transferred the ability to direct the use of the asset by making decisions about how and for what purpose the asset will be used and if the lessor has substantive substitution rights. identification of a lease may require significant judgment.
•we recognized right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities for operating leases that have not previously been recorded. the lease liability for operating leases is based on the net present value of future minimum lease payments. the right-of-use asset for operating leases is based on the lease liability adjusted for the reclassification of certain balance sheet amounts such as prepaid rent and deferred rent which we remeasured at adoption due to the application of hindsight to our lease term estimates. deferred and prepaid rent will no longer be presented separately.
•capital lease assets previously included within property and equipment, net were reclassified to financing lease right-of-use assets, and capital lease liabilities previously included in short-term debt and long-term debt were reclassified to financing lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.
•certain line items in the consolidated statements of cash flows and the "supplemental disclosure of cash flow information" have been renamed to align with the new terminology presented in the new lease standard; "repayment of capital lease obligations" is now presented as "repayments of financing lease obligations" and "assets acquired under capital lease obligations" is now presented as "financing lease right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations." in the "operating activities" section of the consolidated statements of cash flows we have added "operating lease right-of-use assets" and "short and long-term operating lease liabilities" which represent the change in the operating lease asset and liability, respectively. additionally, in the "supplemental disclosure of cash flow information" section of the consolidated statements of cash flows we have added "operating lease payments," and in the "noncash investing and financing activities" section we have added "operating lease right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations."
•in determining the discount rate used to measure the right-of-use asset and lease liability, we use rates implicit in the lease, or if not readily available, we use our incremental borrowing rate. our incremental borrowing rate is based on an estimated secured rate comprised of a risk-free libor rate plus a credit spread as secured by our assets. determining a credit spread as secured by our assets may require significant judgment.
•certain of our lease agreements include rental payments based on changes in the consumer price index ("cpi"). lease liabilities are not remeasured as a result of changes in the cpi; instead, changes in the cpi are treated as variable lease payments and are excluded from the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. these payments are recognized in the period in which the related obligation was incurred. our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.
•we elected the use of hindsight whereby we applied current lease term assumptions that are applied to new leases in determining the expected lease term period for all cell sites. upon adoption of the new lease standard and application of hindsight our expected lease term has shortened to reflect payments due for the initial non-cancelable lease term only. this assessment corresponds to our lease term assessment for new leases and aligns with the payments that have been disclosed as lease commitments in prior years. as a result, the average remaining lease term for cell sites has decreased from approximately nine to five years based on lease contracts in effect at transition on january 1, 2019. the aggregate impact of using hindsight is an estimated decrease in total operating expenses of $240 million in fiscal year 2019.
•we were also required to reassess the previously failed sale-leasebacks of certain t-mobile-owned wireless communications tower sites and determine whether the transfer of the assets to the tower operator under the arrangement met the transfer of control criteria in the revenue standard and whether a sale should be recognized. determining whether the transfer of control criteria has been met requires significant judgement.
•we concluded that a sale has not occurred for the 6,200 tower sites transferred to crown castle international corp. ("cci") pursuant to a master prepaid lease arrangement; therefore, these sites will continue to be accounted for as failed sale-leasebacks.
•we concluded that a sale should be recognized for the 900 tower sites transferred to cci pursuant to the sale of a subsidiary and for the 500 tower sites transferred to phoenix tower international ("pti"). upon adoption on january 1, 2019, we derecognized our existing long-term financial obligation and the tower-related property and equipment associated with these 1,400 previously failed sale-leaseback tower sites and recognized a lease liability and right-of-use asset for the leaseback of the tower sites. the impacts from the change in accounting conclusion are primarily a decrease in other revenues of $44 million and a decrease in interest expense of $34 million in fiscal year 2019.
•rental revenues and expenses associated with co-location tower sites are presented on a net basis under the new lease standard. these revenues and expenses were presented on a gross basis under the former lease standard.
lease expense we have operating leases for cell sites, retail locations, corporate offices and dedicated transportation lines, some of which have escalating rentals during the initial lease term and during subsequent optional renewal periods. we recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for operating leases based on the net present value of future minimum lease payments. lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable lease term and renewal periods that are considered reasonably certain.
we consider several factors in assessing whether renewal periods are reasonably certain of being exercised, including the continued maturation of our network nationwide, technological advances within the telecommunications industry and the availability of alternative sites.
see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies and note 15 - leases of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
revenue recognition we primarily generate our revenue from providing wireless services to customers and selling or leasing devices and accessories. our contracts with customers may involve multiple performance obligations, which include wireless services, wireless devices or a combination thereof, and we allocate the transaction price between each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price.
significant judgments the most significant judgments affecting the amount and timing of revenue from contracts with our customers include the following items:
•revenue for service contracts that we assess are not probable of collection is not recognized until the contract is completed or terminated and cash is received. collectibility is re-assessed when there is a significant change in facts or circumstances. our assessment of collectibility considers whether we may limit our exposure to credit risk through our right to stop transferring additional service in the event the customer is delinquent as well as certain contract terms such as down payments that reduce our exposure to credit risk. customer credit behavior is inherently uncertain. see "allowances," below, for more discussion on how we assess credit risk.
•promotional eip bill credits offered to a customer on an equipment sale that are paid over time and are contingent on the customer maintaining a service contract may result in an extended service contract based on whether a substantive penalty is deemed to exist. determining whether contingent eip bill credits result in a substantive termination penalty may require significant judgment.
•the identification of distinct performance obligations within our service plans may require significant judgment.
•revenue is recorded net of costs paid to another party for performance obligations where we arrange for the other party to transfer goods or services to the customer (i.e., when we are acting as an agent). for example, performance obligations relating to services provided by third-party content providers where we neither control a right to the content provider's service nor control the underlying service itself are presented net because we are acting as an agent. the determination of whether we control the underlying service or right to the service prior to our transfer to the customer requires, at times, significant judgment.
•for transactions where we recognize a significant financing component, judgment is required to determine the discount rate. for eip sales, the discount rate used to adjust the transaction price primarily reflects current market interest rates and the estimated credit risk of the customer. customer credit behavior is inherently uncertain. see "allowances", below, for more discussion on how we assess credit risk.
•our products are generally sold with a right of return, which is accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. device return levels are estimated based on the expected value method as there are a large number of contracts with similar characteristics and the outcome of each contract is independent of the others. historical return rate experience is a significant input to our expected value methodology.
•sales of equipment to indirect dealers who have been identified as our customer (referred to as the sell-in model) often include credits subsequently paid to the dealer as a reimbursement for any discount promotions offered to the end consumer. these credits (payments to a customer) are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize from the sales of equipment to indirect dealers and are estimated based on historical experience and other factors, such as expected promotional activity.
•the determination of the standalone selling price for contracts that involve more than one performance obligation may require significant judgment, such as when the selling price of a good or service is not readily observable.
•for capitalized contract costs, determining the amortization period over which such costs are recognized as well as assessing the indicators of impairment may require significant judgment.
see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies and note 10 - revenue from contracts with customers of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
allowances we maintain an allowance for credit losses, which is management's estimate of such losses inherent in our receivables portfolio, comprised of accounts receivable and eip receivable segments. changes in the allowance for credit losses and, therefore, in related provision for credit losses ("bad debt expense") can materially affect earnings. credit risk characteristics are assessed for each receivable segment. in applying the judgment and review required to determine the allowance for credit losses, management considers a number of factors, including receivable volumes, receivable delinquency status, historical loss experience and other conditions influencing loss expectations, such as macro-economic conditions. while our methodology attributes portions of the allowance to specific portfolio segments, the entire allowance for credit losses is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total receivables portfolio.
management also considers an amount that represents management's judgment of risks inherent in the process and assumptions used in establishing the allowance for credit losses, including process risk and other subjective factors, including industry trends and emerging risk assessments.
to the extent that actual loss experience differs significantly from historical trends or assumptions, the appropriate allowance levels for realized credit losses could differ from the estimate. we write off account balances if collection efforts are unsuccessful and the receivable balance is deemed uncollectible, based on factors such as customer credit ratings and the length of time from the original billing date.
we offer certain retail customers the option to pay for their devices and other purchases in installments over a period of up to 36 months using an eip. eip receivables not held for sale are reported in our consolidated balance sheets at outstanding principal adjusted for any charge-offs, allowance for credit losses and unamortized discounts. receivables held for sale are reported at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. at the time of an installment sale, we impute a discount for interest if the eip term exceeds 12 months as there is no stated rate of interest on the eip receivables. the eip receivables are recorded at their present value, which is determined by discounting future cash payments at the imputed interest rate. the difference between the recorded amount of the eip receivables and their unpaid principal balance (i.e., the contractual amount due from the customer) results in a discount which is allocated to the performance obligations of the arrangement and recorded as a reduction in transaction price. we determine the imputed discount rate based primarily on current market interest rates and the estimated credit risk on the eip receivables. as a result, we do not recognize a separate credit loss allowance at the time of issuance as the effects of uncertainty about future cash flows resulting from credit risk are included in the initial present value measurement of the receivable. the imputed discount on eip receivables is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and recognized as other revenues in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
subsequent to the initial determination of the imputed discount, we assess the need for and, if necessary, recognize an allowance for credit losses to the extent the amount of estimated probable losses on the gross eip receivable balances exceed the remaining unamortized imputed discount balances.
deferred purchase price assets in connection with the sales of certain service and eip accounts receivable pursuant to the sale arrangements, we have deferred purchase price assets measured at fair value that are based on a discounted cash flow model using unobservable level 3 inputs, including customer default rates and credit worthiness, dilutions and recoveries. see note 4 - sales of certain receivables of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
depreciation depreciation commences once assets have been placed in service. we generally depreciate property and equipment over the period the property and equipment provide economic benefit. leased wireless devices are depreciated to their estimated residual value over the period expected to provide utility to us, which is generally shorter than the lease term and considers expected losses. depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property, plant and equipment. these studies consider actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution. when these factors indicate that the useful life of an asset is different from the previous assessment, the remaining book values are depreciated prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies and note 5 - property and equipment of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding depreciation of assets, including management's underlying estimates of useful lives.
evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment we assess the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our spectrum licenses, for potential impairment annually as of december 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate such assets might be impaired.
we have identified two reporting units for which discrete financial information is available and results are regularly reviewed by management: wireless and layer3. the layer3 reporting unit consists of the assets and liabilities of layer3 tv, inc., which was acquired in january 2018. the wireless reporting unit consists of the remaining assets and liabilities of t-mobile us, inc., excluding layer3 tv, inc. we separately evaluate these reporting units for impairment.
when assessing goodwill for impairment we may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. if we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative test. we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
we employed a qualitative approach to assess the wireless reporting unit. the fair value of the wireless reporting unit is determined using a market approach, which is based on market capitalization. we recognize market capitalization is subject to volatility and will monitor changes in market capitalization to determine whether declines, if any, necessitate an interim impairment review. in the event market capitalization does decline below its book value, we will consider the length, severity and reasons for the decline when assessing whether potential impairment exists, including considering whether a control premium should be added to the market capitalization. we believe short-term fluctuations in share price may not necessarily reflect the underlying aggregate fair value.
we employed a quantitative approach to assess the layer3 reporting unit. the fair value of the layer3 reporting unit is determined using an income approach, which is based on estimated discounted future cash flows.
we made estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, discount rates and long-term growth rates to determine the reporting unit's estimated fair value. the key assumptions used were as follows:
•expected cash flows underlying the layer3 business plan for the periods 2020 through 2024, which took into account estimates of subscribers for tvision services, average revenue and content cost per subscriber, operating costs and capital expenditures.
•cash flows beyond 2024 were projected to grow at a long-term growth rate estimated at 3%. estimating a long-term growth rate requires significant judgment about future business strategies as well as micro- and macro-economic environments that are inherently uncertain.
•we used a discount rate of 32% to risk adjust the cash flow projections in determining the estimated fair value.
the estimated fair value of the layer3 reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 3% as of december 31, 2019. delays in the national launch of tvision services or cash flows that do not meet our projections could result in a goodwill impairment of layer3 in the future. the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the layer3 reporting unit was $218 million as of december 31, 2019.
we test our spectrum licenses for impairment on an aggregate basis, consistent with our management of the overall business at a national level. we may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying value. if we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset. if the estimated fair value of the spectrum licenses is lower than their carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. we estimate fair value using the greenfield methodology, which is an income approach, to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. the greenfield methodology values the spectrum licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the asset to be valued (in this case, spectrum licenses). the value of the spectrum licenses can be considered as equal to the present value of the cash flows of this hypothetical start-up company. we base the assumptions underlying the greenfield methodology on a combination of market participant data and our historical results, trends and business plans. future cash flows in the greenfield methodology are based on estimates and assumptions of market participant revenues, ebitda margin, network build-out period and a long-term growth rate for a market participant. the cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital.
the valuation approaches utilized to estimate fair value for the purposes of the impairment tests of goodwill and spectrum licenses require the use of assumptions and estimates, which involve a degree of uncertainty. if actual results or future expectations are not consistent with the assumptions, this may result in the recording of significant impairment charges on goodwill or spectrum licenses. the most significant assumptions within the valuation models are the discount rate, revenues, ebitda margins, capital expenditures and the long-term growth rate. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies and note 6 - goodwill, spectrum license transactions and other intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our annual impairment test and impairment charges.
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these differences are realized. a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions within the carryforward periods available.
we account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. we assess whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position and adjust the unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law.

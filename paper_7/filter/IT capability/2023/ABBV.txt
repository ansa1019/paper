executive overview company overview abbvie is a global, diversified research-based biopharmaceutical company positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio that has leadership positions across immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. abbvie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases.
abbvie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from abbvie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. in the united states, abbvie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. outside the united states, abbvie sells products primarily to wholesalers or through distributors, and depending on the market works through largely centralized national payers systems to agree on reimbursement terms. certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. abbvie operates as a single global business segment and has approximately 50,000 employees.
2024 strategic objectives abbvie's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines and products that solve serious health issues today and address the medical challenges of tomorrow while achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution. abbvie intends to execute its strategy and advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) maximizing the benefits of a diversified revenue base with multiple long-term growth drivers; (ii) leveraging abbvie's commercial strength and international infrastructure across therapeutic areas and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches; (iii) continuing to invest in and expand its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iv) generating substantial operating cash flows to support investment in innovative research and development, and return cash to shareholders via a strong and growing dividend while also continuing to repay debt. in addition, abbvie anticipates several regulatory submissions and data readouts from key clinical trials in the next 12 months.
abbvie expects to achieve its strategic objectives through:
•skyrizi and rinvoq revenue growth driven by increasing market share and skyrizi indication expansion.
•successful integration of the immunogen, inc. and proposed cerevel therapeutics acquisitions.
•advancing our oncology portfolio driven by venclexta, strong commercial execution of epkinly, elahere and other new product launches and effectively managing regulatory, market and competitive challenges impacting imbruvica.
•aesthetics revenue growth driven by global expansion, increasing market penetration of botox and juvederm collection and strong commercial execution of new product launches.
•maximizing abbvie's existing eye care portfolio.
•the favorable impact of pipeline products and indications recently approved or currently under regulatory review where approval is expected in 2024. these products are described in greater detail in the section labeled "research and development" included as part of this item 7.
2023 financial results abbvie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, maximizing the benefits of a diversified revenue base, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. the company's financial performance in 2023 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $54.3 billion, operating earnings of $12.8 billion, diluted earnings per share of $2.72 and cash flows from operations of $22.8 billion. worldwide net revenues decreased by 6% on a reported and constant currency basis due to humira biosimilar competition which was partially offset by growth across the non-humira product portfolio.
diluted earnings per share in 2023 was $2.72 and included the following after-tax costs: (i) $6.7 billion related to the amortization of intangible assets; (ii) $5.0 billion for the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; (iii) $3.5 billion related to intangible asset impairment; and (iv) $122 million of acquisition and integration expenses. these costs were partially offset by an after-tax gain of $381 million related to a favorable settlement of a litigation matter. additionally, financial results reflected continued funding to support all stages of abbvie's pipeline assets and continued investment in abbvie's on-market brands.
regulation the inflation reduction act of 2022 has and will continue to have a significant impact on how drugs are covered and paid for under the medicare program, including through the creation of financial penalties for drugs whose price increases outpace inflation, the redesign of medicare part d benefits to shift a greater portion of the costs to manufacturers, and through government price-setting for certain medicare part b and part d drugs. in 2023, imbruvica was selected as one of the first 10 medicines subject to government-set prices beginning in 2026. the price-setting process will conclude in 2024 and the centers for medicare & medicaid services will publish prices that will be applicable to the 10 selected drugs beginning in 2026. it is possible that more of our products, including products that generate substantial revenues, could be selected in future years, which could, among other things, accelerate revenue erosion prior to expiration of intellectual property protections. the effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products would significantly impact our results of operations. see part i, item 1 "business - regulation - commercialization, distribution and manufacturing," part i, item 1a "risk factors" and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
research and development research and innovation are the cornerstones of abbvie's business as a global biopharmaceutical company. abbvie's long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.
abbvie's pipeline currently includes approximately 90 compounds, devices or indications in development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important specialties as immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. of these programs, approximately 50 are in mid- and late-stage development.
the following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from mid-stage development to late-stage development as well as developments in significant late-stage and registration programs. abbvie expects multiple mid-stage programs to transition into late-stage programs in the next 12 months.

income tax expense the effective income tax rate was 22% in 2023, 12% in 2022 and 11% in 2021. the effective income tax rates differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the impact of foreign operations with lower income tax rates in locations outside the united states, the u.s. global minimum tax, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, tax credits and incentives in the united states, puerto rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, and business development activities. the effective income tax rate in 2023 was higher than prior periods due to increased changes in fair value of contingent consideration, intangible asset impairments and the impacts of the transition from the puerto rico excise tax to an income tax.
in 2022, puerto rico enacted act 52-2002 (the "puerto rico act") allowing for a transition from a puerto rico excise tax levied on gross inventory purchases to an income-based tax beginning in 2023. the company completed the transition requirements of the puerto rico act in 2022, resulting in the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on income tax rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future. the net tax benefit recognized in 2022 from the remeasurement of deferred taxes related to the puerto rico act was $323 million.
our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by future tax policy and law changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including changes in tax law related to the projects undertaken by the organization for economic cooperation and development ("oecd"). these projects include a global minimum tax rate of 15%, referred to as "pillar two", and the creation of a new global system to tax income based on the location to which products are sold, referred to as "pillar one." numerous countries have agreed to a statement in support of the oecd model rules and european union member states have agreed to implement pillar two. this implementation includes aspects of legislation that are effective starting in 2024. more widespread implementation of pillar two is expected to continue, and incremental aspects of the legislation may start in 2025. significant details around the provision are still emerging. these changes increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact income tax expense in future years. we will continue to monitor pending legislation and implementation by individual countries and evaluate the potential impact on our business in future periods.

access to capital the company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations or has the ability to issue additional debt. the company's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company's key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. at the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives.
credit ratings in 2023, moody's investors service upgraded abbvie's senior unsecured long-term credit rating to a3 with a stable outlook from baa1 with a positive outlook and affirmed abbvie's prime-2 short-term credit rating. in addition, standard and poor's global ratings upgraded abbvie's long-term issuer credit rating to a- with a stable outlook from bbb+ with a positive outlook. unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company's ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company's outstanding debt.

acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2023, abbvie entered into a definitive agreement to acquire cerevel therapeutics for a total value of approximately $8.7 billion. the transaction is expected to close in 2024 subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
subsequent to 2023, on february 12, 2024, abbvie completed its previously announced acquisition of immunogen for a total value of approximately $10.1 billion.
in connection with these acquisitions, abbvie entered into several debt and financing arrangements. see note 5 and note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
collaborations, licensing and other arrangements abbvie enters into collaborative, licensing and other arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, or commercial milestones. individually, these arrangements are insignificant in any one annual reporting period. however, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. from a business perspective, the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate future cash flows from product sales. it is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these collaboration arrangements.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. a summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the company's financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. actual results may vary from these estimates.
revenue recognition abbvie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the company's customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration abbvie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. abbvie
45       | 2023 form 10-k generates revenue primarily from product sales. for the majority of sales, the company transfers control, invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer.
rebates abbvie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers, state government medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer medicare drug plans, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities.
rebate and chargeback accruals are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold. provisions for rebates and chargebacks totaled $56.8 billion in 2023, $41.4 billion in 2022 and $33.9 billion in 2021. rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. for each type of rebate, the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant.
in order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals, the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate. to estimate the rebate percentage or net price, the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer. the company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers, available prescription volume information, product pricing, historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves. abbvie regularly monitors its reserves and records adjustments when rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate. historically, adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings.
the following table is an analysis of the three largest accruals for rebates and chargebacks, which comprise approximately 94% of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks recorded as reductions to revenues in 2023. remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings.
provisions                                   9,622             11,306                      11,286
provisions                                  11,713             14,119                      13,070
provisions                                  15,153             23,978                      14,191
other allowances other allowances include cash discounts, product returns, sales incentives and other adjustments, which are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related product is sold. reserves for cash discounts and sales incentives are readily determinable because the company's experience of payment history is fairly consistent. product returns can be reliably estimated based on the company's historical return experience. cash discounts totaled $2.0 billion in 2023, $1.8 billion in 2022 and $1.6 billion in 2021. allowances other than cash discounts are not significant.
pension and other post-employment benefits abbvie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the pension and other post-employment benefit plans that are direct obligations of abbvie. the valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions. the significant assumptions, which are reviewed annually, include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates and are disclosed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
the discount rate is selected based on current market rates on high-quality, fixed-income investments at december 31 each year. abbvie employs a yield-curve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists. the yield curve is developed using high-quality bonds. the yield-curve approach reflects the plans' specific cash flows (i.e. duration) in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve. abbvie reflects the plans' specific cash flows and applies them to the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense. for other countries, abbvie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate.
abbvie's assumed discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other post-employment plans as of december 31, 2023. a 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on abbvie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2024 and projected benefit obligations as of december 31, 2023:
(in millions) (brackets denote a reduction)        increase                       decrease defined benefit plans net periodic benefit cost                          $(49)                          $70
projected benefit obligation                       (674)                          756
other post-employment plans net periodic benefit cost                          $(6)                            $7
projected benefit obligation                       (53)                            59
the expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation, historical performance and the current view of expected future returns. abbvie considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market influences. the current long-term rate of return on plan assets for each plan is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target asset allocation. abbvie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of december 31, 2023 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2024. a one percentage point change in assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2024 by $106 million.
the health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases. the current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of each plan. assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of december 31, 2023 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2024.
income taxes abbvie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pre-tax earnings based on current tax laws. deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. a valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
litigation the company is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. accordingly, abbvie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore, the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. as information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected.
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets abbvie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that abbvie records at fair value. transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur between companies in
47       | 2023 form 10-k the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion. the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. in-process research and development (ipr&d) acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained, at which time it is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. ipr&d acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately, unless deemed to have an alternative future use. payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life.
abbvie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
annually, the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macro-economic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors, the overall financial performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. if the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. abbvie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. if the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed.
for its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease projected cash flows and the estimated fair value of the related intangible assets. future changes to these estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on the company's results of operations. actual results may differ from the company's estimates.
contingent consideration the fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved. the potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a monte carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs, which are disclosed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period.

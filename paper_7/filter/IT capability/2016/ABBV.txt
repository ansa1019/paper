item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition of abbvie inc. (abbvie or the company) as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 and results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2016. this commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."
executive overview company overview abbvie is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company formed in 2013 following separation from abbott laboratories (abbott). abbvie's mission is to use its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. abbvie's products are focused on treating conditions such as chronic autoimmune diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology and dermatology; oncology, including blood cancers; virology, including hepatitis c (hcv) and human immunodeficiency virus (hiv); neurological disorders, such as parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis; metabolic diseases, including thyroid disease and complications associated with cystic fibrosis; as well as other serious health conditions. abbvie also has a pipeline of promising new medicines across such important medical specialties as immunology, virology, oncology and neurology, with additional targeted investment in cystic fibrosis and women's health.
abbvie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from abbvie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. in the united states, abbvie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients. outside the united states, sales are made either directly to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. abbvie has approximately 30,000 employees. abbvie operates in one business segment-pharmaceutical products.
2016 financial results abbvie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. in 2016, abbvie's worldwide net revenues grew by 12% to $25.6 billion, driven primarily by the continued strength of humira, post-acquisition revenue growth related to imbruvica and revenue growth in other key products including creon and duodopa. these increases were partially offset by a decline in net revenues of kaletra and viekira.
the company's financial performance in 2016 included delivering diluted earnings per share of $3.63. 2016 results included the following after-tax costs: (i) $615 million related to the amortization of intangible assets; (ii) a $298 million currency devaluation loss related to venezuela; (iii) $273 million related to the acquisition of stemcentrx and boehringer ingelheim (bi) compounds; (iv) $228 million for changes in contingent consideration; (v) $200 million for acquired in-process research and development (ipr&d); (vi) $187 million associated with a tax law change for regulations issued in the fourth quarter of 2016 that revised the treatment of foreign currency translation gains and losses for certain operations; and (vii) milestone payments of $80 million. additionally, 2016 financial results reflected added funding to support abbvie's emerging mid- and late-stage pipeline assets and continued investment in abbvie's growth brands.
in 2016, the company generated cash flows from operations of $7.0 billion, which abbvie utilized to continue to enhance its pipeline through licensing and collaboration activities, pay cash dividends to stockholders of $3.7 billion and repurchase approximately 34 million shares for $2.1 billion in the open market (excluding the shares repurchased under an accelerated repurchase agreement). in october 2016, abbvie's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.64 per share of common stock payable in february 2017. this reflects an increase of approximately 12% over the previous quarterly rate of $0.57 per share of common stock.
in april 2016, abbvie acquired all rights to risankizumab (bi 655066), an anti-il-23 monoclonal biologic antibody, from bi pursuant to a global collaboration agreement. in june 2016, abbvie acquired stemcentrx, a privately held biotechnology company. the transaction expands abbvie's oncology pipeline by adding the late-stage asset rovalpituzumab tesirine (rova-t), four additional early-stage clinical compounds in solid tumor indications and a significant portfolio of pre-clinical assets. rova-t is currently in registrational trials for small cell lung cancer and in early-stage clinical development for other solid tumors. in connection with the stemcentrx acquisition, abbvie's board of directors authorized a $4.0 billion increase to abbvie's existing share repurchase program. promptly following the closing of the stemcentrx transaction, abbvie entered into and executed a $3.8 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement (asr) with a third party financial institution to reacquire nearly all of the newly-issued equity. in may 2016, abbvie issued $7.8 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes. of the $7.7 billion net proceeds, $2.0 billion was used to repay the company's outstanding term loan that was due to mature in november 2016, approximately $1.9 billion was used to finance the acquisition of stemcentrx and approximately $3.8 billion was used to finance the asr. in november 2016, the company issued €3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior euro notes and repaid the company's outstanding 1.75% senior notes that were due to mature in november 2017. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the acquisition of stemcentrx and bi compounds, note 9 for additional information related to the senior euro notes and note 12 for additional information related to the asr.
2017 strategic objectives abbvie's mission is to be an innovation-driven, patient-focused specialty biopharmaceutical company capable of achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution and a consistent stream of innovative new medicines. abbvie intends to continue to advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) growing revenues through continued strong performance from its existing portfolio of on-market products, including its flagship brands, humira and imbruvica as well as growth from pipeline products; (ii) expanding operating margins; (iii) continued investment in its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology, virology and neurology as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iv) augmentation of its pipeline through concerted focus on strategic licensing, acquisition and partnering activity with a focus on identifying compelling programs that fit abbvie's strategic criteria; and (v) returning cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. in addition, abbvie anticipates several regulatory submissions and key data readouts from key clinical trials in the next twelve months.
abbvie expects to achieve its strategic objectives as follows:
•   humira sales growth by driving biologic penetration across disease categories, increasing market leadership and strong commercial execution.
•   imbruvica revenue growth driven by increasing market share within its five currently approved indications.
•   the favorable impact of pipeline products approved in 2016 or currently under regulatory review where approval is expected in 2017. these products are described in greater detail in the section labeled "research and development" included as part of this item 7.
abbvie remains committed to driving continued expansion of operating margins and expects to achieve this objective through productivity initiatives in supply chain, ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses and continued leverage from revenue growth. abbvie also remains committed to returning cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.
research and development research and innovation are the cornerstones of abbvie's business as a global biopharmaceutical company. abbvie's long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.
abbvie's pipeline currently includes more than 50 compounds or indications in clinical development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important medical specialties as immunology, oncology, virology and neurology along with targeted investments in cystic fibrosis and women's health. of these programs, more than 30 are in mid- and late-stage development.
the following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from phase 2 development to phase 3 development as well as developments in significant phase 3 and registration programs. abbvie expects multiple phase 2 programs to transition into phase 3 programs in the next twelve months.
significant programs and developments immunology humira
•   in may 2016, the european medicines agency (ema) granted approval for humira for the treatment of pediatric patients aged six years or older, with moderate to severely active crohn's disease.
•   in june 2016, humira received both u.s. food and drug administration (fda) and ema approval to treat adults with non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis. humira is now the first and only fda-approved non-corticosteroid therapy available for adults with non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis. this approval marks the 10th approved indication for humira in the united states for immune-mediated disease and the 14th approved indication in all geographies.
•   in november 2016, abbvie announced that that the committee for medicinal products for human use (chmp) granted a positive opinion for humira to treat adolescents with hidradenitis suppurativa (hs). if future approval is granted by the european commission, humira will be the first and only treatment option for patients aged 12 and older with hs. humira was approved for adults with moderate to severe hs by the european commission in july 2015.
•   in april 2016, abbvie acquired all rights to risankizumab (bi 655066), an anti-il-23 monoclonal biologic antibody in phase 3 development for psoriasis, from bi pursuant to a global collaboration agreement. abbvie is also evaluating the potential of this biologic therapy in crohn's disease, psoriatic arthritis and asthma. in addition to risankizumab, abbvie also gained rights to an anti-cd40 antibody, bi 655064, currently in phase 1 development.
•   in november 2016, abbvie announced that the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) granted risankizumab orphan drug designation for the treatment of pediatric patients with crohn's disease.
•   abbvie continued to make progress with abt-494, the company's selective jak-1 inhibitor currently in late-stage development for rheumatoid arthritis. in first quarter of 2016, abbvie initiated three phase 3 studies in the registrational program. in the fourth quarter of 2016, the company started a fifth pivotal trial.
•   in july 2016, following an evaluation of data for the development of abt-122, a dual-variable domain (dvd) immunoglobulin targeting tnf and il-17 in phase 2 trials for rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis, abbvie determined that further development of abt-122 will not be pursued. while the trial data demonstrated that the dvd platform worked well, with clear evidence of biologic activity, the decision was based on a lack a differentiation from other candidates in abbvie's development pipeline.
•   in october 2016, abbvie opted not to exercise an option to license vobarilizumab, an anti-il-6r nanobody, from ablynx nv based on results of a phase 2 study in rheumatoid arthritis. abbvie retains an option to license vobarilizumab based on results of an on-going phase 2 study in systemic lupus erythematosus.
•   in march 2016, abbvie announced that the fda approved imbruvica as a first-line treatment for patients with cll. the approval was based on data from the phase 3 resonate-2 trial, which evaluated efficacy and safety of imbruvica versus traditional chemotherapy, chlorambucil, in treatment-naïve patients with cll or small lymphocytic leukemia. this is the first fda-approved chemotherapy-free treatment option for first-line cll patients. in may 2016, abbvie announced that the ema approved imbruvica as a first-line treatment option for adult patients with cll. imbruvica is now available to treat all lines of cll in the european union (eu). this is the fifth treatment indication in the eu for imbruvica.
•   in may 2016, abbvie announced that the fda updated the imbruvica prescribing information to include new data from two phase 3 trials supporting expanded use in patients with cll and small lymphocytic lymphoma. the label now includes overall survival results in previously-untreated cll/small lymphocytic lymphoma patients from the phase 3 resonate-2 trial. the imbruvica label has also been updated with safety and efficacy data from the phase 3 helios trial assessing the use of imbruvica in combination with bendamustine and rituximab versus placebo plus rituximab in relapsed/refractory patients with cll/small lymphocytic lymphoma. additionally, the fda approved a new imbruvica indication to include the treatment of patients with small lymphocytic lymphoma with or without the deletion of chromosome 17p.
•   in june 2016, abbvie announced that the fda granted imbruvica breakthrough therapy designation for chronic graft-versus-host-disease after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy, a rare condition with limited treatment options. this is the fourth breakthrough therapy designation for imbruvica.
•   in january 2017, abbvie announced that the fda approved imbruvica for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma (mzl) who require systemic therapy and have received at least one prior anti-cd20-based therapy. this indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate (orr) and continued approval may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. mzl is a slow-growing form of non-hodgkin's lymphoma. this marks the seventh fda approval and fifth disease indication for imbruvica since the medication's initial approval in 2013.
•   in april 2016, the fda granted accelerated approval of venclexta (venetoclax) tablets for patients diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll) with 17p deletion who have received at least one prior therapy. additionally, in january 2016, the fda granted two additional breakthrough therapy designations for venetoclax: (i) in combination with rituximab for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory cll, including patients with chromosome 17p deletion; and (ii) in combination with hypomethylating agents for the treatment of patients with untreated (treatment-naïve) acute myeloid leukemia (aml) who are ineligible to receive standard induction therapy (high-dose chemotherapy). a phase 3 clinical trial was recently initiated to study the safety and efficacy of venetoclax in combination with azacitidine in treatment naïve elderly subjects with aml who are ineligible for standard induction therapy.
•   in july 2016, abbvie announced the initiation of a phase 3 clinical trial to study the safety and efficacy of venetoclax in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who are considered sensitive or naive to proteasome inhibitors and have received one to three prior lines of therapy. the combination of venetoclax, bortezomib and dexamethasone will be compared to treatment with bortezomib, dexamethasone and placebo.
•   in december 2016, abbvie announced that the european commission (ec) has granted conditional marketing authorization for venclyxto (venetoclax) monotherapy for the treatment of cll in the presence of 17p deletion or tp53 mutation in adult patients who are unsuitable for or have failed a b-cell receptor pathway inhibitor; and for the treatment of cll in the absence of 17p deletion or tp53 mutation in adult patients who have failed both chemoimmunotherapy and a b-cell receptor pathway inhibitor. conditional marketing authorization is granted to medicines that address an unmet medical need, where the benefit of its immediate availability to patients outweighs the risk of limited data availability and where comprehensive data will be provided. venclyxto is a fist-in-class, oral, once-daily medicine that selectively inhibits the function of the bcl-2 protein. venclyxto is being developed by abbvie and genentech, a member of the roche group. it is jointly commercialized by the companies in the u.s. and by abbvie outside of the u.s.
•   in june 2016, abbvie acquired stemcentrx and its lead late-stage asset rova-t currently in registrational trials for small cell lung cancer (sclc). rova-t is a novel bio-marker-specific therapy that is derived from cancer stem cells and targets delta-like protein 3 (dll3) that is expressed in more than 80% of sclc patient tumors and is not present in healthy tissue. registrational trials for third-line sclc are expected to complete enrollment by the end of 2016. abbvie recently began enrollment of a phase 1 eight-arm "basket study" in neuroendocrine tumors and a phase 1/2 regimen selection study as a first-line treatment for sclc. beyond rova-t, stemcentrx has four novel compounds in clinical trials across several solid tumor indications and has additional pre-clinical compounds.
•   in july 2016, bms and abbvie announced a clinical trial collaboration to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of rova-t in combination with bms' opdivo (nivolumab) and opdivo + yervoy (ipilimumab) regimen as a treatment for relapsed extensive stage sclc. the phase 1/2 clinical program will explore the potential of combining bms' immune-oncology agents in conjunction with rova-t to drive improved and sustained efficacy and tolerability above the current standard of care.
•   in may 2016, bristol-myers squibb company (bms) and abbvie announced that the ema approved empliciti (elotuzumab) for the treatment of multiple myeloma as combination therapy with revlimid® (lenalidomide) and dexamethasone in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy. empliciti is now the first and only immunostimulatory antibody approved for multiple myeloma in the eu.
•   in june 2016, abbvie exercised its right to end its global collaboration with infinity pharmaceuticals, inc. (infinity), which it entered into in september 2014 to develop and commercialize duvelisib (ipi-145) for the treatment of patients with cancer. pursuant to the terms of the global collaboration agreement, the worldwide rights to duvelisib reverted to infinity.
•   in february 2016, abbvie announced that chmp granted a positive opinion for the use of viekira (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir tablets) + exviera (dasabuvir tablets) without ribavirin (rbv) in chronic hcv infected genotype 1b (gt1b) patients with compensated cirrhosis (child-pugh a). in april 2016, abbvie announced that the fda approved viekira pak (ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir tablets; dasabuvir tablets) without rbv in patients with gt1b chronic hcv infection and compensated cirrhosis. in july 2016, abbvie announced that the fda approved a new drug application (nda) for viekira xr (dasabuvir, ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir) extended-release tablets. viekira xr is a once-daily, extended-release co-formulation of the active ingredients in viekira pak (ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir tablets; dasabuvir tablets) and is for the treatment of patients with chronic genotype 1 (gt1) hcv, including those with compensated cirrhosis (child-pugh a).
•   in october 2016, abbvie announced that the fda granted breakthrough therapy designation for the investigational, pan-genotypic regimen of glecaprevir (abt-493)/pibrentasvir (abt-530) for the treatment of patients with hcv who failed previous therapy with direct-acting antivirals in genotype 1, including therapy with an ns5a inhibitor and/or protease inhibitor.
•   in january 2017, abbvie announced that its marketing authorization application (maa) has been validated and is now under accelerated assessment by the ema for the company's investigational, pan-genotypic regimen of g/p for the treatment of all major chronic hcv genotypes. g/p is also intended to address the needs of patients with specific treatment challenges, including those with severe chronic kidney disease (ckd) and those not cured with previous direct-acting antiviral (daa) treatment. in february 2017, abbvie announced that the fda accepted its new drug application (nda) and granted priority review for the company's investigational, pan-genotypic regimen of g/p for the treatment of all major chronic hcv genotypes.
•   in may 2016, biogen and abbvie announced that the fda approved zinbryta (daclizumab) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (rms). zinbryta is a once-monthly, self-administered, subcutaneous injection. biogen and abbvie will co-promote zinbryta in the united states. in july 2016, biogen and abbvie announced that the ema granted a marketing authorization for zinbryta for the treatment of adult patients with rms. zinbryta launched in the third quarter of 2016.
•   in january 2016, abbvie announced the initiation of the first of two planned phase 3 studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of elagolix in the treatment of patients with uterine fibroids. abbvie made a milestone payment of $15 million to neurocrine biosciences, inc., abbvie's collaboration partner, upon enrollment of the first patient. elagolix is also in phase 3 development for endometriosis.
results of operations net revenues the comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency net revenues at the prior year's foreign exchange rates. this measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and the current periods. abbvie believes that the non-gaap measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the gaap measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.

research and development (r&d) expenses in 2016 increased compared to 2015 principally due to increased funding to support the company's emerging mid- and late-stage pipeline assets. these increases were partially offset by the following factors: (i) 2015 r&d expenses included a $350 million charge related to the purchase of a priority review voucher from a third party; (ii) development milestones decreased in 2016 to $80 million compared to $133 million in 2015; and (iii) 2015 results included restructuring charges of $32 million. acquisition costs decreased in 2016 to $140 million compared to $152 million in 2015. in addition to the 2015 factors discussed above, r&d expense in 2014 included regulatory milestone payments of $40 million made to a collaboration partner for regulatory milestones related to the company's hcv program.

interest expense in 2016 increased due to the may 2015 issuance of $16.7 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, which were issued primarily to finance the acquisition of pharmacyclics and the may 2016 issuance of $7.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, which were issued primarily to finance the acquisition of stemcentrx and to repay an outstanding term loan. additionally, interest expense in 2016 included a debt extinguishment charge of $39 million related to the 1.75% senior notes redemption. these increases were partially offset by the absence of bridge financing-related costs of $86 million in 2015 incurred in connection with the acquisition of pharmacyclics. interest income in 2016 increased due to growth in the company's investment securities. interest expense, net in 2015 increased due to the may 2015 issuance of $16.7 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. interest expense, net in 2014 included $141 million of financing related fees incurred in connection with the terminated proposed combination with shire.
net foreign exchange loss in 2016 included losses totaling $298 million related to the devaluation of abbvie's net monetary assets denominated in the venezuelan bolivar. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the venezuelan devaluation. net foreign exchange loss in 2015 included losses of $170 million to complete the liquidation of the company's remaining foreign currency positions related to the terminated proposed combination with shire. in 2014, abbvie entered into certain undesignated forward contracts to hedge the then anticipated foreign currency cash outflows associated with the then proposed combination with shire. net foreign exchange loss in 2014 included losses of $666 million associated with the shire-related forward contracts.
other expense, net in 2016 included a charge of $228 million related to the change in fair value of the bi and stemcentrx contingent consideration liabilities. the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by the passage of time and multiple other inputs, including the probability of success of achieving regulatory/commercial milestones, discount rates and other market-based factors. in 2016, the change in fair value represented mainly the passage of time, as increases to the bi contingent consideration liability due to higher probabilities of success were fully offset by the effects of rising interest rates and changes in other market-based assumptions. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the acquisitions of stemcentrx and bi compounds. other expense, net for 2015 included impairment charges totaling $36 million related to certain of the company's equity investment securities. other expense, net in 2014 primarily consisted of income of $34 million from the resolution of a contractual agreement.
income tax expense the effective income tax rate was 24% in 2016, 23% in 2015 and 25% in 2014. the effective tax rate in each period differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the benefit from foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the united states, tax exemptions and incentives in puerto rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, business development activities and the cost of repatriation decisions. the increase in the effective tax rate for 2016 over the prior year was principally due to changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings, as well as certain discrete factors and events, including acquisitions and collaborations. the effective tax rate in 2016 included additional expense of $187 million related to the recognition of the tax effect of regulations issued by the internal revenue service on december 7, 2016 that changed the determination of the u.s. taxability of foreign currency gains and losses related to certain foreign operations. the effective income tax rate in 2015 included a tax benefit of $103 million from a reduction of state valuation allowances. the effective income tax rate in 2014 included state valuation allowances of $129 million and additional expenses of $129 million related to the branded prescription drug fee, which is non-deductible.

cash flows provided by operations in 2016 was $7.0 billion compared to $7.5 billion in 2015. operating cash flows in 2016 reflected improved results of operations resulting from revenue growth and an improvement in operating margin, offset by income tax payments. cash provided by operating activities also reflected abbvie's voluntary contributions, primarily to its domestic defined benefit plans of $150 million in 2016, $150 million in 2015 and $370 million in 2014. abbvie also made a voluntary contribution of $150 million to this plan subsequent to december 31, 2016. abbvie paid $350 million to purchase a priority review voucher from a third party in 2015. cash flows provided by operations in 2015 was $7.5 billion compared to $3.5 billion in 2014. the increase was primarily due to improved results of operations due to revenue growth and an improvement in operating margin as well as the absence of after-tax transaction and financing-related and other costs of $1.8 billion incurred in connection with the termination of the proposed combination with shire, including net foreign exchange losses related to the settlement of undesignated forward contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows and the exit of certain foreign currency positions. realized excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation totaled $55 million in 2016, $61 million in 2015 and $56 million in 2014 and were presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as an outflow within the operating section and an inflow within the financing section.
investing cash flows in 2016 primarily included $1.9 billion cash consideration paid to acquire stemcentrx in june 2016, $595 million upfront payment to acquire certain rights from bi in april 2016 and net purchases of investment securities totaling $3.0 billion. investing activities in 2015 primarily included the $11.5 billion cash consideration paid to acquire pharmacyclics in may 2015 (net of cash acquired of $877 million). investing activities in 2015 also included cash outflows related to other acquisitions and investments of $964 million, including a $500 million payment to calico, $100 million related to an exclusive worldwide license agreement with c2n to develop and commercialize anti-tau antibodies for the treatment of alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders and $130 million paid to infinity due to the achievement of a development milestone under the collaboration agreement. investing activities in 2014 included cash outflows related to other acquisitions and investments totaling $622 million, including $275 million paid to infinity and $250 million paid to calico. cash flows from investing activities in 2016, 2015 and 2014 also reflected capital expenditures. abbvie incurred additional expenditures in 2014 to purchase a manufacturing facility and in 2015 to build a new biologics facility on that site.
in 2016 and 2015, the company issued and redeemed commercial paper. the balance of commercial paper outstanding was $377 million as of december 31, 2016 and $400 million as of december 31, 2015. abbvie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed. in november 2016, the company issued €3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior euro notes. the company used the proceeds to redeem $4.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.75% senior notes due to mature in november 2017. in connection with the offering, abbvie incurred $17 million of issuance costs. in may 2016, the company issued $7.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. approximately $2.0 billion of the net proceeds were used to repay an outstanding term loan that was due to mature in november 2016, approximately $1.9 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of stemcentrx and approximately $3.8 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance an asr. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the asr transactions. in connection with the may 2016 issuance of senior notes, abbvie incurred $52 million of issuance costs.
in may 2015, the company issued $16.7 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes. approximately $11.5 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of pharmacyclics and $5.0 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance an asr. in 2015 the company paid $86 million of costs relating to an $18.0 billion, 364-day bridge term loan credit agreement (the bridge loan) as well as $93 million of costs relating to the may 2015 issuance of senior notes. no amounts were drawn under the bridge loan, which was terminated as a result of the issuance of the senior notes. in september 2015, abbvie entered into a three-year $2.0 billion term loan credit facility and a 364-day $2.0 billion term loan credit facility. in november 2015, abbvie drew on these term facilities and used the proceeds to refinance its $4.0 billion of senior notes that matured in 2015.
cash dividend payments totaled $3.7 billion in 2016 and $3.3 billion in 2015. the increase in cash dividend payments was primarily due to an increase in the dividend rate. on october 28, 2016, abbvie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend from $0.57 per share to $0.64 per share beginning with the dividend payable on february 15, 2017 to stockholders of record as of january 13, 2017. this reflects an increase of approximately 12% over the previous quarterly rate. the timing, declaration, amount of and payment of any dividends is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including abbvie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of abbvie's debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors.
in addition to the asrs, the company repurchased approximately 34 million shares for $2.1 billion in the open market in 2016 and approximately 46 million shares for $2.8 billion in the open market in 2015. purchases of abbvie shares under this program may be made from time to time at management's discretion. the program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. abbvie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was $36 million as of december 31, 2016. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the asr. on february 16, 2017, abbvie's board of directors authorized a $5.0 billion increase to abbvie's existing stock repurchase program. the stock repurchase authorization permits shares to be repurchased in open market or private transactions, has no time limit and may be discontinued at any time.
cash and equivalents were also negatively impacted by net unfavorable exchange rate changes totaling $338 million in 2016 and $300 million in 2015. the unfavorable exchange rate changes in 2016 were primarily due to the devaluation of abbvie's net monetary assets denominated in the venezuelan bolivar. the unfavorable exchange rate changes in 2015 were principally due to the weakening of the euro and other foreign currencies on the translation of the company's euro-denominated assets and cash denominated in foreign currencies. while a significant portion of cash and equivalents at december 31, 2016 are considered reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries, abbvie does not expect such reinvestment to affect its liquidity and capital resources. if these funds were needed for operations in the united states, abbvie would be required to accrue and pay u.s. income taxes to repatriate these funds. abbvie believes that it has sufficient sources of liquidity to support its assumption that the disclosed amount of undistributed earnings at december 31, 2016 has been reinvested indefinitely.
credit risk abbvie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. abbvie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. abbvie establishes an allowance against accounts receivable when it is probable they will not be collected. abbvie also monitors the potential for and periodically has utilized factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables.
abbvie continues to do business with foreign governments in certain countries, including greece, portugal, italy and spain, that have historically experienced challenges in credit and economic conditions. substantially all of abbvie's trade receivables in greece, portugal, italy and spain are with government health systems. outstanding net governmental receivables in these countries totaled $244 million as of december 31, 2016 and $525 million at december 31, 2015. the company also continues to do business with foreign governments in certain oil-exporting countries, which have recently experienced a deterioration in economic conditions, including saudi arabia and russia. outstanding net governmental receivables were $122 million related to saudi arabia and $110 million related to russia as of december 31, 2016. due to oil market conditions in recent years, liquidity issues in certain countries may result in delays in the collection of receivables. global economic conditions and customer-specific factors may require the company to periodically re-evaluate the collectability of its receivables and the company could potentially incur credit losses.
currently, abbvie does not believe the economic conditions in oil-exporting countries will have a significant impact on the company's liquidity, cash flow or financial flexibility. however, if government funding were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse changes in their reimbursement practices were to occur, abbvie may not be able to collect the entire balance outstanding as of december 31, 2016.
39 | 2016 form 10-k credit facility, access to capital and credit ratings credit facility abbvie currently has a $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility, which matures in october 2019. the revolving credit facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. at december 31, 2016, the company was in compliance with all its credit facility covenants. commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility as of december 31, 2016 and 2015.
access to capital the company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations, or by issuing additional debt. the company's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt, or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company's key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. at the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives.
credit ratings on april 28, 2016, following the announcement of the proposed acquisition of stemcentrx, s&p global ratings (s&p) lowered abbvie's corporate credit rating and senior unsecured debt rating to "a-" from "a". abbvie's "a-1" short-term rating remained unchanged. s&p revised its ratings outlook to "stable" from "negative". on june 1, 2016, moody's investor service downgraded abbvie's senior unsecured long-term rating to baa2 from baa1 and affirmed abbvie's prime-2 short-term rating. there were no additional changes in the company's credit ratings in 2016.
unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company's ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company's outstanding debt.

(a)   includes estimated future interest payments on long-term debt securities and capital lease obligations. interest payments on debt are calculated for future periods using forecasted interest rates in effect at the end of 2016. projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements. certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates or other factors or events. the projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at december 31, 2016. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company's debt instruments and note 10 for additional information on the interest rate agreements outstanding at december 31, 2016.
(b)   includes the company's significant unconditional purchase obligations. these commitments do not exceed the company's projected requirements and are made in the normal course of business.
(c)   amounts less than one year includes a voluntary contribution of $150 million abbvie made to its main domestic defined benefit plan subsequent to december 31, 2016. amounts otherwise exclude pension and other post-employment benefits and related deferred compensation cash outflows. timing of funding is uncertain and dependent on future movements in interest rates and investment returns, changes in laws and regulations and other variables. also included in this amount are components of other long-term liabilities including restructuring. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on restructuring and note 11 for additional information on the pension plan.
(d)   excludes liabilities associated with the company's unrecognized tax benefits as it is not possible to reliably estimate the timing of the future cash outflows related to these liabilities. see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these unrecognized tax benefits.
(e)   includes $4.2 billion of contingent consideration liabilities related to the acquisitions of stemcentrx and bi compounds which are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. potential contingent consideration payments that exceed the fair value recorded on the consolidated balance sheet are not included in the table of contractual obligations. see notes 5 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these liabilities.
abbvie enters into r&d collaboration arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, or commercial milestones. individually, these arrangements are insignificant in any one annual reporting period. however, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. from a business perspective, the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from product sales. it is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. as a result, these potential payments are not included in the table of contractual obligations. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these collaboration arrangements.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. a summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the company's financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. actual results may vary from these estimates.
revenue recognition abbvie recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured. revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer.
rebates abbvie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers, state government medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer medicare drug plans, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities.
rebate and chargeback accruals are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold. rebates and chargebacks totaled $10.8 billion in 2016, $8.6 billion in 2015 and $5.9 billion in 2014. rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. for each type of rebate, the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant.
in order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals, the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate. to estimate the rebate percentage or net price, the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer. the company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers, available prescription volume information, product pricing, historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves. abbvie regularly monitors its reserves and
41 | 2016 form 10-k records adjustments when rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate. historically, adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings.
the following table is an analysis of the three largest rebate accruals and chargeback allowances, which comprise approximately 90% of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks recorded as reductions to revenues in 2016. remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings.
provisions                                     1,015                               970                            2,825
provisions                                     1,716                             2,215                            3,866
provisions                                     2,606                             3,146                            3,987
cash discounts and product returns allowances for cash discounts and product returns, which totaled $964 million in 2016, $898 million in 2015 and $610 million in 2014, are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related product is sold. the reserve for cash discounts is readily determinable because the company's experience of payment history is fairly consistent. product returns can be reliably estimated based on the company's historical return experience.
pension and other post-employment benefits abbvie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the plans that are direct obligations of abbvie. the valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions. the significant assumptions, which are reviewed annually, include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates. the significant assumptions used in determining these calculations are disclosed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
the discount rate is selected based on current market rates on high-quality, fixed-income investments at december 31 each year. abbvie employs a yield-curve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists. the yield curve is developed using high-quality bonds. the yield curve approach reflects the plans' specific cash flows (i.e. duration) in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve. beginning in 2016, abbvie also reflected the plans' specific cash flows and applied them to the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense. for other countries, abbvie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate. abbvie's assumed discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other post-employment plans as of december 31, 2016. a 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on abbvie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2017 and projected benefit obligations as of december 31, 2016:
(in millions) (brackets denote a reduction)   increase                decrease defined benefit plans service and interest cost                     $(50      )             $54
projected benefit obligation                  (452      )             511
projected benefit obligation                  (51       )              58
effective december 31, 2015, abbvie elected to change the method it uses to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs. historically, abbvie estimated these service and interest cost components of this expense utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. in late 2015, abbvie elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. abbvie elected to make this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. abbvie has accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle. this change reduced abbvie's net periodic benefit cost by approximately $41 million in 2016. this change had no effect on the 2015 expense and will not affect the measurement of abbvie's total benefit obligations.
the expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation, historical performance and the current view of expected future returns. abbvie considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market influences. the current long-term rate of return on plan assets is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target asset allocation. abbvie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of december 31, 2016 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2017. a one percentage point change in assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2017 by $49 million.
the health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases. the current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of the plan. assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of december 31, 2016 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2017. a one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on abbvie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2017 and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31, 2016:
projected benefit obligation                  120                 (95       )
income taxes abbvie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement
43 | 2016 form 10-k carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. a valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
litigation the company is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. accordingly, abbvie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore, the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. as information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected.
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets abbvie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that abbvie records at fair value. transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion. the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. ipr&d acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained, at which time it is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. ipr&d acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately, unless deemed to have an alternative future use. payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life.
abbvie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to ipr&d, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
annually, the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macro-economic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors, which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows, the overall financial performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. if the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. abbvie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets using a quantitative impairment test.
for its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, foreign currency exchange rates, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views of a company and similar companies. the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the company's results of operations. actual results may differ from the company's estimates.
contingent consideration the fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products still in development. changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved. significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these inputs. changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period. at december 31, 2016, a 50 basis point increase/decrease in the assumed discount rate would have decreased/increased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately $180 million. additionally, at december 31, 2016, a five percentage point increase/decrease in the assumed probability of success across all potential indications would have increased/decreased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately $360 million.

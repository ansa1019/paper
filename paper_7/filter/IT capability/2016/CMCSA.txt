item 7: management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and overview we are a global media and technology company with two primary businesses, comcast cable and nbcuniversal. we present our operations for comcast cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as cable communications, and our operations for nbcuniversal in four reportable business segments: cable networks, broadcast television, filmed entertainment and theme parks (collectively, the "nbcuniversal segments").
the following provides an overview of our businesses.
cable communications segment comcast cable is one of the nation's largest providers of video, high-speed internet and voice services ("cable services") to residential customers under the xfinity brand, and we also provide these and other services to business customers. as of december 31, 2016, our cable systems had 28.6 million total customer relationships, of which 26.5 million were residential customer relationships; served 22.5 million video customers, 24.7 million high-speed internet customers and 11.7 million voice customers; and passed more than 56 million homes and businesses.
our cable communications segment generates revenue primarily from residential and business customers subscribing to our cable services, which we market individually and as bundled services, and from the sale of advertising. customers are typically billed in advance on a monthly basis based on the services and features comcast 2016 annual report on form 10-k   40
they receive and the type of equipment they use. the majority of our residential cable services customers are not subject to minimum-term contracts for their services, while substantially all of our business customers are. minimum-term contracts are typically 2 years in length for residential customers and typically range from 2 to 5 years for business services customers. customers with minimum-term contracts may only discontinue service in accordance with the terms of their contracts, which typically include an early termination fee.
nbcuniversal segments nbcuniversal is one of the world's leading media and entertainment companies that develops, produces and distributes entertainment, news and information, sports, and other content for global audiences, and owns and operates theme parks worldwide.
cable networks our cable networks segment consists primarily of a diversified portfolio of cable television networks. our cable networks are comprised of our national cable entertainment networks (usa network, e!, syfy, bravo, oxygen, sprout, esquire network, chiller, universal hd and cloo), our national cable news and information networks (msnbc, cnbc and cnbc world), our national cable sports networks (nbc sports network and golf channel), our regional sports and news networks, our international cable networks, our cable television studio production operations, and related digital media properties.
our cable networks segment generates revenue primarily from the distribution and licensing of its programming and from the sale of advertising on its networks.
broadcast television our broadcast television segment consists primarily of the nbc and telemundo broadcast television networks, our nbc and telemundo owned local broadcast television stations, the nbc universo national cable network, our broadcast television studio production operations, and related digital media properties.
our broadcast television segment generates revenue primarily from the sale of advertising on its networks, from the licensing of its programming, and from fees received under retransmission consent agreements and associated fees received from nbc-affiliated local broadcast television stations.
filmed entertainment our filmed entertainment segment primarily produces, acquires, markets and distributes filmed entertainment worldwide, and it also develops, produces and licenses live stage plays. our films are produced primarily under the universal pictures, illumination and focus features names, and in august 2016, we acquired dreamworks animation. dreamworks animation creates animated feature films, television series and specials, live entertainment and related consumer products.
our filmed entertainment segment generates revenue primarily from the worldwide distribution of our owned and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters and from the licensing and sale of our owned and acquired films.
theme parks our theme parks segment consists primarily of our universal theme parks in orlando, florida and hollywood, california and our 51% interest in the universal studios theme park in osaka, japan ("universal studios japan"), which we acquired in november 2015. in addition, along with a consortium of chinese state-owned companies, we are developing a theme park in china.
41      comcast 2016 annual report on form 10-k corporate and other our other business interests consist primarily of the operations of comcast spectacor, which owns the philadelphia flyers and the wells fargo center arena in philadelphia, pennsylvania and operates arena management-related businesses.
we currently anticipate launching a comcast-branded wireless phone service in 2017 using our virtual network operator rights to provide the service over a third party's wireless network, although we are still evaluating the parameters of the anticipated offering. a wireless phone service will have success-based working capital requirements, primarily associated with the procurement of handsets and other equipment, as we launch the new service.
2016 developments the following are the more significant developments in our businesses during 2016:
cable communications segment
   an increase in revenue of 6.6% to $50.0 billion and an increase in operating income before depreciation and amortization of 5.6% to $20.1 billion
   a decrease in operating margin to 40.2% primarily due to higher programming expenses, which were partially offset by increases in high-speed internet, video and business services revenue
   investments to improve the customer experience, including by hiring additional personnel and developing and deploying various technology and software tools
   an increase in capital expenditures of 7.9% to $7.6 billion primarily due to:
   an increased investment in line extensions, primarily for the expansion of our business services
   an increased investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity
   the continued deployment of wireless gateways
   the continued deployment of our x1 platform, which is now available in all of the markets in which we operate, and our cloud dvr technology, which is now available in substantially all of our markets
               an increase in total nbcuniversal revenue of 11.0% to $31.6 billion; excluding $1.6 billion of revenue associated with our broadcast of the rio olympics in august 2016, as well as $376 million of revenue associated with our broadcast of the super bowl in february 2015, total nbcuniversal revenue increased 6.7%
   an increase in total nbcuniversal operating income before depreciation and amortization of 13.8% to $7.2 billion
   an increase in cable networks segment revenue of 8.7%, including $432 million associated with our broadcast of the 2016 rio olympics
   an increase in broadcast television segment revenue of 19.0%, including $1.2 billion associated with our broadcast of the 2016 rio olympics
   the acquisition of dreamworks animation for $3.8 billion in our filmed entertainment segment comcast 2016 annual report on form 10-k   42
   an increase in theme parks segment revenue of 12.7% on a pro forma combined basis to include universal studios japan
   the announcement that we anticipate launching a comcast-branded wireless phone service in 2017 using our virtual network operator rights to provide the service over a third party's wireless network competition the results of operations of our reportable business segments are affected by competition, as all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment, news and information content to consumers.
for additional information on the competition our businesses face, see item 1: business and refer to the "competition" discussion within that section and see item 1a: risk factors and refer to the risk factors within that section entitled "our businesses currently face a wide range of competition, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively" and "changes in consumer behavior driven by new technologies and distribution platforms for viewing content may adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models."
seasonality and cyclicality each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. in our cable communications segment, our results are impacted by the seasonal nature of customers receiving our cable services in college and vacation markets. this generally results in a reduction in net customer additions in the second quarter and an increase in net customer additions in the third and fourth quarters of each year.
revenue in our cable communications, cable networks and broadcast television segments is subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. advertising revenue in the u.s. is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year, due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season. advertising revenue in the u.s. is also cyclical, with a benefit in even-numbered years due to advertising related to candidates running for political office and issue-oriented advertising. revenue in our cable networks and broadcast television segments fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired, which typically results in higher advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year. our revenue and operating costs and expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization ("operating costs and expenses") are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events, such as the olympic games, which affect our cable networks and broadcast television segments, and the super bowl, which affects our broadcast television segment. our advertising revenue increases in the period of these broadcasts due to increased demand for advertising time, and our operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs and the amortization of the related rights fees.
revenue in our filmed entertainment segment fluctuates due to the timing of the release of films in movie theaters, on standard-definition digital video discs and blu-ray discs (together, "dvds") and through various other distribution platforms. release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. as a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holiday season. revenue in our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment segments also fluctuates due to the timing of when our content is made available to licensees.
43      comcast 2016 annual report on form 10-k revenue in our theme parks segment fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and weather variations, local entertainment offerings and the opening of new attractions as well as with changes in currency exchange rates. our theme parks generally experience peak attendance during the spring holiday period, the summer months when schools are closed and the holiday season.

consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2016 and 2015 primarily due to increases in capital expenditures, as well as expenditures for software, in our cable communications segment in recent years. we continue to invest to increase our network capacity and in customer premise equipment, primarily for our x1 platform and cloud dvr technology and for wireless gateways. in addition, because these assets generally have shorter estimated useful lives, our depreciation expenses have increased and we expect this will continue in 2017. nbcuniversal depreciation and amortization expense also increased due to the acquisition of the 51% interest in universal studios japan in november 2015 and our investments in new attractions in the theme parks segment.
segment operating results our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information. we use operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, excluding impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses from the sale of assets, if any, as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. this measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. additionally, it is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. we use this measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. it is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. we believe that this measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. because we use operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization to measure our segment profit or loss, we reconcile it to operating income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap"), in the business segment footnote to our comcast 2016 annual report on form 10-k   46
consolidated financial statements (see note 17 to comcast's consolidated financial statements and note 16 to nbcuniversal's consolidated financial statements). this measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to comcast corporation or nbcuniversal, net cash provided by operating activities, or other measures of performance or liquidity we have reported in accordance with gaap.
the revenue and operating costs and expenses associated with our broadcasts of the 2016 rio olympics and the sochi olympics in february 2014 were reported in our cable networks and broadcast television segments. the revenue and operating costs and expenses associated with our broadcast of the 2015 super bowl were reported in our broadcast television segment.
we have adjusted prior period segment operating results to reflect certain changes in our management reporting presentation. see note 17 to comcast's consolidated financial statements for additional information on these changes.

cable communications segment  revenue video our cable communications segment offers a broad variety of video service packages that may include premium networks, pay-per-view services and our on demand service. our video customers may subscribe for additional fees to our high-definition ("hd") video and digital video recorder ("dvr") advanced services. we are actively deploying set-top boxes for our internet protocol ("ip") and cloud-enabled video platform, referred to as our x1 platform, and cloud dvr technology throughout our footprint.
comcast 2016 annual report on form 10-k   48
video revenue increased 3.9% and 3.6% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. the increases in revenue in both years were primarily due to rate adjustments and an increase in the number of residential customers subscribing to additional services such as premium channels and advanced services, which accounted for increases in revenue of 3.9% and 4.5% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. as of december 31, 2016, 14.8 million customers subscribed to at least one of our hd or dvr advanced services compared to 13.9 million customers and 13.0 million customers as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. net additional video customers increased in 2016 primarily due to reduced customer churn, which we believe is a result of our continued deployment of our x1 platform as well as improvements we have made in the customer experience. the increase in revenue in 2015 was partially offset by a decrease in the number of residential video customers, which was primarily due to competitive pressures and the impact of rate adjustments.
as of december 31, 2016, 39.9% of the homes and businesses in the areas we serve subscribed to our video services, compared to 40.1% and 40.9% as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. we have in the past, and may in the future, experience declines in the number of residential video customers due to competitive pressures and the impact of rate adjustments.
high-speed internet we offer high-speed internet services with downstream speeds from a range of up to 10 mbps to fiber-based speeds up to 2 gbps. we are actively deploying wireless gateways throughout our footprint, which combine a customer's wireless router, cable modem and voice adapter, to improve the performance of multiple ip-enabled devices used at the same time within the home, provide faster internet speeds and create an in-home wi-fi network. we are continuing to expand our network of residential, outdoor and business wi-fi hotspots to allow most of our high-speed internet customers to access our high-speed internet services inside and outside the home. as of december 31, 2016, there were approximately 15.8 million of these hotspots.
high-speed internet revenue increased 8.5% and 10.2% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. increases in the number of residential customers receiving our high-speed internet services accounted for increases in revenue of 5.8% in both 2016 and 2015. the remaining increases in revenue in both 2016 and 2015 were primarily due to increases in the number of customers receiving higher levels of service and the impact of rate adjustments.
as of december 31, 2016, 43.8% of the homes and businesses in the areas we serve subscribed to our high-speed internet services, compared to 41.9% and 40.2% as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. our customer base continues to grow as consumers choose our high-speed internet service and seek higher-speed offerings.
voice revenue decreased 1.9% and 1.7% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. while the number of residential customers receiving voice services through our discounted bundled service offerings increased in both years, revenue was negatively impacted by the allocation of voice revenue for our customers who receive bundled services. the amount allocated to voice revenue in the rate charged for bundled services decreased in both years because video and high-speed internet rates increased while voice rates remained relatively flat.

49      comcast 2016 annual report on form 10-k business services we offer our cable services to small and medium-sized businesses and to large enterprises with multiple locations. we offer ethernet network services that connect multiple locations and provide higher downstream and upstream speed options to medium-sized businesses and large enterprises. we also provide cellular backhaul services to mobile network operators to help those customers manage network bandwidth.
business services revenue increased 16.1% and 20.0% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. the increase in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in the number of small business customers, as well as continued growth in our medium-sized business services, including ethernet network and advanced voice services. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to an increase in the number of small business customers receiving our high-speed internet and voice services and rate adjustments. in 2016, 2015 and 2014, our small business customers represented more than 70% of total business services revenue. we believe the increases in the number of business customers were primarily the result of our efforts to gain market share from competitors by offering competitive services and pricing, although the rate of growth in the number of our small business customers may slow as the business matures.
advertising our cable communications segment also sells advertising. as part of our distribution agreements with cable networks, we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time on cable networks that we sell through our advertising business, spotlight, to local, regional and national advertisers. in most cases, the available advertising units are sold by our sales force. in some cases, we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising units allocated to us. we also represent the advertising sales efforts of other multichannel video providers in some markets. in addition, we generate revenue from the sale of advertising online and on our on demand service. advertising revenue is affected by the strength of the advertising market and general economic conditions.
advertising revenue increased 9.6% in 2016 primarily due to an increase in political advertising revenue. advertising revenue decreased 3.8% in 2015 primarily due to a decrease in political advertising revenue. excluding the impact of political advertising revenue, advertising revenue increased slightly in 2016 and 3.0% in 2015.

other other revenue primarily includes revenue related to cable franchise and other regulatory fees. we also receive revenue related to fees from other services, such as our home security and automation services. cable franchise and other regulatory fees represent the fees we are required to pay to federal, state and local authorities that we pass through to our customers. under the terms of our cable franchise agreements, we are generally required to pay to the cable franchising authority an amount based on our gross video revenue. the changes in franchise and other regulatory fees collected from our cable services customers are generally due to changes in the revenue to which the fees apply.
other revenue increased 13.8% and 11.3% in 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to increases in cable franchise and other regulatory fees, revenue from our home security and automation services and revenue from other services.

cable communications segment  operating costs and expenses programming expenses programming expenses, which represent our most significant operating expense, are the fees we incur to provide content to our video customers. these expenses are affected by the programming license fees charged by cable networks, the fees charged for retransmission of the signals from local broadcast television stations, the number of video customers we serve and the amount of content we provide. programming expenses increased in 2016 and 2015 primarily due to increases in programming license fees, including retransmission consent fees, sports programming costs and fees to secure rights for additional programming for distribution across an increasing number of platforms.
we anticipate that our programming expenses will increase at a higher growth rate in 2017, as the fees we pay will increase primarily due to the timing of contract renewals and increases in retransmission consent fees and sports programming costs; as we provide additional content to our video customers; and as we deliver this content through an increasing number of platforms, including on demand, online and through our mobile apps. we believe that adding more content and delivering it on various platforms will help us to attract and retain video customers.
technical and product support expenses technical and product support expenses include costs to complete service call and installation activities, as well as costs for network operations, product development, fulfillment and provisioning. technical and product support expenses increased in 2016 and 2015 primarily due to expenses related to the development, delivery and support of our enhanced devices and services, including our x1 platform, cloud dvr technology and wireless gateways, and continued growth in business services and home security and automation services. the increases in both years were also due to expenses related to investments to improve the customer experience.
customer service expenses customer service expenses include the personnel and other costs associated with handling the sale of services to customers and customer service activity. customer service expenses increased in 2016 and 2015 primarily due to increased support for improving the customer experience and increases in total labor costs, which reflect sales and support activities associated with the continued deployment of our enhanced devices and services, including our x1 platform and wireless gateways, and continued growth in business services and home security and automation services. the rate of growth of our customer service expenses decreased in 2016 primarily due to reduced call volumes.
franchise and other regulatory fees franchise and other regulatory fees increased in 2016 and 2015 primarily due to increases in the revenue to which the fees apply.
advertising, marketing and promotion expenses advertising, marketing and promotion expenses increased in 2016 and 2015 primarily due to increases in spending associated with attracting new residential and business services customers and encouraging existing customers to add additional or higher-tier services.
other operating costs and expenses other operating costs and expenses increased in 2016 and 2015 primarily due to increases in costs to support our advertising sales business, as well as increases in other administrative costs.

distribution revenue increased in 2016 primarily due to increases in the contractual rates charged under distribution agreements and contract renewals, as well as $298 million of revenue associated with our broadcast of the 2016 rio olympics, which were partially offset by a decline in the number of subscribers at some of our cable networks. distribution revenue increased in 2015 primarily due to increases in the contractual rates charged under distribution agreements that were partially attributable to the premiere of nascar programming on the nbc sports network in 2015. the increases in 2015 were partially offset by a decrease in revenue from a decline in the number of subscribers at some of our cable networks and $177 million of revenue in 2014 associated with our broadcast of the 2014 sochi olympics. excluding revenue associated with our broadcasts of the 2016 rio olympics and the 2014 sochi olympics, distribution revenue increased 5.8% and 6.5% in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
advertising advertising revenue is generated from the sale of advertising units sold on our cable networks and related digital media properties. advertising revenue is primarily based on the price we charge for each advertising unit, which is generally based on audience ratings, the value of our viewer demographics to advertisers and the number of advertising units we can place in our cable networks' programming schedules. advertising revenue is affected by the audience ratings of our programming, the strength of the national advertising market and general economic conditions. audience ratings at our cable networks have declined, which has negatively affected advertising revenue in recent years, and may continue to decline as the number of programming choices, such as subscription video on demand services, continues to increase and as more viewers use dvrs and video on demand services to view our content outside of traditional audience ratings measurement periods.
advertising revenue increased in 2016 primarily due to $134 million of revenue associated with our broadcast of the 2016 rio olympics. also, higher prices for advertising units were offset by the impact of declining audience ratings. advertising revenue decreased in 2015 primarily due to $80 million of revenue in 2014 associated with our broadcast of the 2014 sochi olympics. in addition, the impact of declining audience ratings in 2015 was partially offset by higher prices for, and an increase in the volume of, advertising units sold, as well as increased advertising revenue associated with the broadcast of nascar programming. excluding revenue associated with our broadcasts of the 2016 rio olympics and the 2014 sochi olympics, advertising revenue decreased slightly in 2016 and increased slightly in 2015 due to the broadcast of nascar programming.

advertising revenue increased in 2016 primarily due to $1.0 billion of revenue associated with our broadcast of the 2016 rio olympics. advertising revenue also increased due to higher prices for advertising units sold, the premiere of thursday night football and higher political advertising, which was partially offset by revenue in 2015 associated with our broadcast of the 2015 super bowl and a decline in audience ratings. advertising revenue decreased in 2015 primarily due to $730 million of revenue in 2014 associated with our broadcast of the 2014 sochi olympics, which was partially offset by $376 million of revenue in 2015 associated with our broadcast of the 2015 super bowl. excluding revenue associated with our broadcasts of the 2016 rio olympics and the 2015 super bowl, revenue increased 7.7% in 2016. excluding revenue associated with our broadcasts of the 2015 super bowl and the 2014 sochi olympics, revenue increased 4.1% in 2015 primarily due to higher prices for, and an increase in the volume of, advertising units sold.
content licensing content licensing revenue is generated from the licensing of our owned programming in the united states and internationally to various distribution platforms, including to cable and broadcast networks, as well as to subscription video on demand services. in addition, our broadcast television studio production operations develop and produce original content that they license to broadcast networks, cable networks and local broadcast television stations owned by us and third parties, as well as to subscription video on demand services. the production and distribution costs related to our owned programming generally exceed the revenue generated from the initial network license, which means the subsequent licensing of our owned programming series following the initial network license is critical to their financial success.
distribution and other we generate distribution and other revenue primarily from fees for retransmission consent of our owned local broadcast television stations and associated fees received from nbc-affiliated local broadcast television stations, as well as from the sale of our owned programming on dvds and through digital distribution services. the sale of our owned programming is driven primarily by the popularity of our broadcast networks and programming series and therefore fluctuates based on consumer spending and acceptance. distribution and other revenue also includes distribution revenue associated with our periodic broadcasts of the olympic games.
distribution and other revenue increased in 2016 primarily due to increases in fees recognized under our retransmission consent agreements, as well as $140 million of distribution revenue associated with our broadcast of the 2016 rio olympics. distribution and other revenue decreased in 2015 primarily due to $116 million of distribution revenue in 2014 that was associated with our broadcast of the 2014 sochi olympics. the decrease was partially offset by an increase in fees recognized under our retransmission consent agreements, as well as new syndication agreements entered into in 2015.

other income (expense), net for 2015 included gains of $335 million on the sales of a business and an investment, $240 million recorded on the settlement of a contingent consideration liability with general electric company related to the acquisition of nbcuniversal, and $43 million related to an equity method investment. these gains were partially offset by $236 million of expenses related to fair value adjustments to a contractual obligation.
other income (expense), net for 2014 included a $27 million favorable settlement of a contingency related to the at&t broadband transaction in 2002, which was more than offset by $208 million of expenses related to fair value adjustments to a contractual obligation and $35 million of expenses related to an indemnification receivable associated with an adjustment to our accruals for uncertain tax positions.
consolidated income tax expense income tax expense reflects federal and state income taxes and adjustments associated with uncertain tax positions. our effective income tax rate in 2016, 2015 and 2014 was 37.0%, 37.1% and 31.1%, respectively.
in 2014, we reduced our accruals for uncertain tax positions and the related accrued interest on these tax positions and, as a result, our income tax expense decreased by $759 million. see note 14 to comcast's consolidated financial statements for additional information on the changes in our accruals for uncertain tax positions and related interest on these tax positions.
we expect our 2017 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 35% to 37%, absent changes in tax laws or significant changes in uncertain tax positions. the expected annual effective tax rate includes the impact of the adoption of the new accounting guidance related to share-based compensation (see note 3 to comcast's consolidated financial statements). if significant tax legislation is enacted in 2017 that includes a change to the federal statutory rate, this could significantly impact our deferred income taxes. for example, using information as of december 31, 2016, for each 1% change in the federal statutory rate, our deferred income tax liability would change by $850 million, which would primarily result in a corresponding change to income tax expense.
consolidated net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock the increases in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock in 2016 and 2015 were primarily due to nbcuniversal's acquisition of the 51% interest in universal studios japan.

(b)                                                purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are legally binding on us and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and price provisions. our purchase obligations related to our cable communications segment and other activities include programming contracts with cable networks and local broadcast television stations; contracts with customer premise equipment manufacturers; communications vendors and multichannel video providers for which we provide advertising sales representation; contracts to acquire handsets and other equipment; and other contracts entered into in the normal course of business. cable communications programming contracts in the table above include amounts payable under fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments and do not represent the total fees that are expected to be paid under programming contracts, which we expect to be significantly higher because these contracts are generally based on the number of subscribers receiving the programming. our purchase obligations related to our nbcuniversal segments consist primarily of commitments to acquire film and television programming, including u.s. broadcast rights to future olympic games through 2032, sunday night football through the 2022-23 season, including the super bowl in 2018 and
2021, thursday night football through the 2017-18 season, nhl games through the 2020-21 season, spanish-language u.s. broadcast rights to fifa world cup games through 2022, u.s broadcast rights to english premier league soccer games through the 2021-22 season, certain pga tour and other golf events through 2030, and certain nascar events through 2024, as well as obligations under various creative talent agreements, including obligations to actors, producers and television personalities, and various other television commitments. purchase obligations do not include contracts with immaterial future commitments.
(c)                                                      other long-term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet consist primarily of subsidiary preferred shares; deferred compensation obligations; and postretirement, pension and postemployment benefit obligations. a contractual obligation with a carrying value of $1.1 billion is not included in the table above because it is uncertain if the arrangement will be settled. the contractual obligation involves an interest held by a third party in the revenue of certain theme parks. the arrangement provides the counterparty with the right to periodic payments associated with current period revenue and, beginning in june 2017, the option to require nbcuniversal to purchase the interest for cash in an amount based on a contractual formula. the contractual formula is based on an average of specified historical theme park revenue at the time of exercise, which amount could be significantly higher than the carrying value. if the option had been exercisable as of december 31, 2016, the estimated value of the contractual obligation would have been approximately $1.4 billion, based on inputs to the contractual formula as of that date. see note 16 to comcast's consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this arrangement. reserves for uncertain tax positions of $1.1 billion are not included in the table above because it is uncertain if or when these reserves will become payable. payments of $2.4 billion of participations and residuals are also not included in the table above because we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which these obligations will be settled.
(d)   our contractual obligations do not include our commitment to invest up to $4 billion at any one time as an investor in atairos due to our inability to estimate the timing of this funding. as of december 31, 2016, our remaining commitment is $2.4 billion based on the capital comcast 2016 annual report on form 10-k   66
calls received as of that date (see note 7 to comcast's consolidated financial statements). in addition, our contractual obligations do not include any future expenditures related to the construction and development of the proposed universal studios theme park in beijing, china or the comcast technology center, as we do not currently have any obligation to fund either initiative.

critical accounting judgments and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. we base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of our cable franchise rights and the accounting for film and television costs are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors, and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them, which are presented below. see notes 9 and 6 to comcast's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to these items.
valuation and impairment testing of cable franchise rights our largest asset, our cable franchise rights, results from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area. the value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market additional services, such as advanced video services and high-speed internet and voice services, in a particular service area. the amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions. typically when we acquire a cable system, the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights. often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas. we currently serve approximately 6,400 franchise areas in the united states.
we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows. accordingly, we do not amortize our cable franchise rights but assess the carrying value of our cable franchise rights annually, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed the fair value ("impairment testing").
67      comcast 2016 annual report on form 10-k for the purpose of our impairment testing, we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our three cable communications divisions or units of account. we evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level.
the annual impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles allows for the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible is less than its carrying amount. an entity may choose to perform the qualitative assessment or an entity may bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. if it is determined, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is, more likely than not, less than its carrying value, the quantitative impairment test is required. when performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment. when analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models, we also consider multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization generated by the underlying assets, current market transactions and profitability information.
in 2016, we performed a qualitative assessment of our cable franchise rights. at the time of our previous quantitative assessment in 2014, the estimated fair values of our franchise rights exceeded the carrying value in our three cable communications divisions by 26%, 42% and 50%, respectively. we also considered various factors that would affect the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights in our qualitative assessment in 2016, including changes in our projected future cash flows associated with our cable communications segment; market transactions and macroeconomic conditions; weighted-average cost of capital; and an increase in our market capitalization. based on this assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights were higher than the carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required.
since the adoption of the accounting guidance related to goodwill and intangible assets in 2002, we have not recorded any significant impairment charges to cable franchise rights as a result of our impairment testing.
we could record impairment charges in the future if there are changes in long-term market conditions, in expected future operating results, or in federal or state regulations that prevent us from recovering the carrying value of these cable franchise rights. assumptions made about increased competition and economic conditions could also impact the results of any qualitative assessment and the valuations used in future annual quantitative impairment testing and result in a reduction in the fair values of our cable franchise rights. in addition, a future change in the unit of account could result in the recognition of an impairment charge.
film and television costs we capitalize film and television production costs, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest. we amortize capitalized film and television production costs, including acquired libraries, and accrue costs associated with participation and residual payments to programming and production expenses. we generally record the amortization and the accrued costs using the individual film forecast computation method, which amortizes the costs using the ratio of the current period's revenue to estimated total remaining revenue from all sources ("ultimate revenue"). estimates of ultimate revenue have a significant impact on how quickly capitalized costs are amortized and, therefore, are updated regularly.
our estimates of ultimate revenue for films generally include revenue from all sources that are expected to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film's initial release. these estimates are based on the historical performance of similar content, as well as factors unique to the content itself. the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for a film intended for theatrical release is the film's theatrical performance, as subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of a film has historically exhibited a high correlation to its theatrical performance. upon a film's release, our estimates of revenue from succeeding comcast 2016 annual report on form 10-k   68
markets, including from content licensing across multiple platforms and home entertainment sales, are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends.
with respect to television series or other owned television programming, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond its initial license. initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue contracted for each episode under the initial license. once it is determined that a television series or other owned television programming can be licensed for subsequent platforms, revenue estimates for these platforms, such as u.s. and international syndication, home entertainment, and other distribution platforms, are included in ultimate revenue. revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or, if still in production, 5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later.
we capitalize the costs of programming content that we license but do not own, including rights to multiyear, live-event sports programming, at the earlier of when payments are made for the programming or when the license period begins and the content is made available for use. we amortize capitalized programming costs as the associated programs are broadcast. we generally amortize multiyear, live-event sports programming rights using the ratio of the current period revenue to the estimated ultimate revenue or under the terms of the contract.
capitalized film and television costs, as well as stage play production costs, are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified. if the fair value of a production were to fall below its unamortized cost, we would record an adjustment for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the production's fair value. the fair value assessment is generally based on estimated future discounted cash flows, which are supported by our internal forecasts. adjustments to capitalized film and stage play production costs of $14 million, $42 million and $26 million were recorded in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

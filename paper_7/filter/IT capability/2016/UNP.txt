item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and applicable notes to the financial statements and supplementary data, item 8, and other information in this report, including risk factors set forth in item 1a and critical accounting policies and cautionary information at the end of this item 7.
the railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our one reportable business segment. although revenue is analyzed by commodity, we analyze the net financial results of the railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of the rail network.
·   safety - during 2016, we continued our focus on safety to reduce risk and eliminate incidents for our employees, our customers and the public. we achieved our best ever reportable personal injury incidents per 200,000 employee-hours of 0.75. in addition, we finished 2016 with a 3% improvement in our reportable derailment incident rate per million train miles compared to the prior year. these results demonstrate our employees' dedication to our safety initiatives and our efforts to further engage the workforce through programs such as courage to care, total safety culture, and up way (our continuous improvement culture).
·   financial performance - in 2016, we generated operating income of $7.3 billion, a 10% decrease compared to 2015. despite a 7% decrease in carloads, resulting in our second lowest volume levels since 1998, 2016 was our third-best earnings performance. core pricing gains, productivity initiatives, and efficient network operations partially offset lower volumes. our operating ratio for 2016 was 63.5%, increasing 0.4 points from last year's record operating ratio of 63.1%, but matching our second best record from 2014. net income of $4.2 billion translated into earnings of $5.07 per diluted share for 2016.
·   freight revenues - our freight revenues declined 9% year-over-year to $18.6 billion as a result of lower volume levels in four of our six commodity groups and lower fuel surcharge revenue, partially offset by core pricing gains. volume declines in coal, intermodal, frac sand, crude oil, finished vehicles, and metals shipments more than offset volume growth in grain, automotive parts, and industrial chemicals shipments.
·   network operations - continued improvements were made in our operating and service metrics, as our average train speed, as reported to the aar, increased 5% in 2016 compared to 2015, and our average terminal dwell time decreased 4%, both reflecting the impact of lower volumes and improved network fluidity.
·   fuel prices - our average price per gallon of diesel fuel in 2016 decreased 20% from the average price in 2015, as both crude oil and the conversion spreads between crude oil and diesel declined in 2016. the lower price decreased operating expenses by $347 million (excluding any impact from year-over-year volume declines). gross-ton miles decreased 8%, which also decreased fuel expense. in addition, our fuel consumption rate, computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles in thousands, improved 1%.
·   free cash flow - cash generated by operating activities totaled $7.5 billion, yielding free cash flow of $2.3 billion after reductions of $3.4 billion for cash used in investing activities and a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.55 to $0.605 declared and paid in the fourth quarter of 2016. free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities and dividends paid.
free cash flow is not considered a financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. (gaap) by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation s-k and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. we believe free cash flow is important to management and investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financings. free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. the following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (gaap measure) to free cash flow (non-gaap measure):
cash provided by operating activities            $7,525          $7,344          $7,385
cash used in investing activities               (3,393)         (4,476)         (4,249)
·   safety - operating a safe railroad benefits all our constituents: our employees, customers, shareholders and the communities we serve. we will continue using a multi-faceted approach to safety, utilizing technology, risk assessment, training and employee engagement, quality control, and targeted capital investments. we will continue using and expanding the deployment of total safety culture and courage to care throughout our operations, which allows us to identify and implement best practices for employee and operational safety. we will continue our efforts to increase detection of rail defects; improve or close crossings; and educate the public and law enforcement agencies about crossing safety through a combination of our own programs (including risk assessment strategies), industry programs and local community activities across our network.
·   network operations - in 2017, we will continue to align resources with customer demand, maintain an efficient network, and ensure surge capability with our assets.
·   fuel prices - fuel price projections for crude oil and natural gas continue to fluctuate in the current environment. we again could see volatile fuel prices during the year, as they are sensitive to global and u.s. domestic demand, refining capacity, geopolitical events, weather conditions and other factors. as prices fluctuate, there will be a timing impact on earnings, as our fuel surcharge programs trail increases or decreases in fuel price by approximately two months.
continuing lower fuel prices could have a positive impact on the economy by increasing consumer discretionary spending that potentially could increase demand for various consumer products that we transport. alternatively, lower fuel prices could likely have a negative impact on other commodities such as coal and domestic drilling-related shipments.
·   capital plan - in 2017, we expect our capital plan to be approximately $3.1 billion, including expenditures for ptc, approximately 60 locomotives scheduled to be delivered, and intermodal containers and chassis, and freight cars. the capital plan may be revised if business conditions warrant or if new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments. (see further discussion in this item 7 under liquidity and capital resources - capital plan.)
·   financial expectations - economic conditions in many of our market sectors continue to drive uncertainty with respect to our volume levels. we expect volume to grow in the low single digit range in 2017 compared to 2016, but it will depend on the overall economy and market conditions. one of the more significant uncertainties is the outlook for energy markets, which will bring both challenges and opportunities. in the current environment, we expect continued margin improvement driven by continued pricing opportunities, ongoing productivity initiatives, and the ability to leverage our resources and strengthen our franchise. over the longer term, we expect the overall u.s. economy to continue to improve at a modest pace, with some markets outperforming others.

we generate freight revenues by transporting freight or other materials from our six commodity groups. freight revenues vary with volume (carloads) and average revenue per car (arc). changes in price, traffic mix and fuel surcharges drive arc. we provide some of our customers with contractual incentives for meeting or exceeding specified cumulative volumes or shipping to and from specific locations, which we record as reductions to freight revenues based on the actual or projected future shipments. we recognize freight revenues as shipments move from origin to destination. we allocate freight revenues between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period and recognize expenses as we incur them.
other revenues include revenues earned by our subsidiaries, revenues from commuter rail operations that we manage, accessorial revenues, which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by us or when we perform additional services such as switching or storage, and miscellaneous contract revenue. we recognize other revenues as we perform services or meet contractual obligations.
freight revenues decreased 9% in 2016 compared to 2015 due to a 7% decline in carloadings, and lower fuel surcharge revenue, partially offset by core pricing gains. volume declines in coal, intermodal, frac sand, crude oil, finished vehicles, and metals shipments more than offset volume growth in grain, automotive parts, and industrial chemicals shipments.
freight revenues from five of our six commodity groups decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to a 6% decline in carloadings and lower fuel surcharge revenue, partially offset by core pricing gains.  volume declines in coal, international intermodal, frac sand, metals, crude oil, and grain shipments more than offset volume growth in domestic intermodal, finished vehicles, automotive parts, industrial chemicals and plastics shipments.
our fuel surcharge programs generated freight revenues of $560 million, $1.3 billion, and $2.8 billion in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. fuel surcharge revenue in 2016 decreased $740 million as a result of a 20% decrease in fuel price, a 7% reduction in carloadings, and the lag impact on fuel surcharge recovery (it can generally take up to two months for changing fuel prices to affect fuel surcharge recoveries). fuel surcharge revenue in 2015 decreased $1.5 billion as a result of a 38% decrease in fuel price and a 6% reduction in carloadings.
in 2016, other revenue decreased from 2015 due to lower revenues at our subsidiaries, primarily those that broker intermodal and automotive services, and lower intermodal accessorial revenue and demurrage fees.
in 2015, other revenue decreased from 2014 due to lower revenues at our subsidiaries, primarily those that broker intermodal and automotive services, partially offset by higher accessorial revenue driven by increased revenue for container usage and demurrage fees.
the following tables summarize the year-over-year changes in freight revenues, revenue carloads, and arc by commodity type:

agricultural products - freight revenue from agricultural products increased compared to 2015 driven by volume growth and core pricing gains, partially offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue and mix of traffic. grain shipments increased 11% in 2016 compared to 2015 due to strong export demand in the second half of the year. market conditions in south america and ample supply of u.s. grains led to competitive u.s. pricing relative to the global market.   2016 agricultural products carloads lower fuel surcharge revenue and volume declines, partially offset by core pricing gains, decreased freight revenue from agricultural shipments in 2015 compared to 2014.  grain shipments decreased 11% in 2015 compared to 2014. the strength of the u.s. dollar, lower grain commodity prices, and higher worldwide inventories contributed to the reduction in overall demand.
automotive - freight revenue from automotive shipments decreased compared to 2015 as a result of lower fuel surcharge revenue and mix of traffic, partially offset by core pricing gains. volume was flat compared to 2015 as a 7% growth in automotive parts from truck-to-rail conversions was offset by a 5% decrease in finished vehicles resulting from a partial contract loss during the year. overall u.s. vehicle production was flat compared to 2015.   2016 automotive carloads freight revenue from automotive shipments increased in 2015 compared to 2014 driven by volume growth and core pricing gains, which were partially offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue. higher automotive production and record sales levels drove the volume growth.
chemicals - freight revenue from chemical shipments declined in 2016 versus 2015 due to volume declines and lower fuel surcharge revenue, which were partially offset by core pricing gains. crude oil shipments declined significantly resulting from continued low crude oil prices, regional pricing differences and available pipeline capacity. fertilizer shipments also declined due to weak world-wide demand for potash in the first half of the year and the strong u.s. dollar. these decreases were partially offset by growth in industrial chemical and liquid petroleum gas shipments.   2016 chemicals carloads freight revenue from chemical shipments declined in 2015 versus 2014 due to lower fuel surcharge revenue and volume declines, which more than offset core price improvements.  crude oil shipments declined as a result of the drop in crude oil prices and production declines from various shale formations, which impacted the regional pricing differences for crude oil.  lower fertilizer shipments also decreased freight revenue in 2015.  strength in export plastics markets and industrial chemical shipments helped offset the decline in crude oil and fertilizer shipments.
coal - lower volume, lower fuel surcharge revenue, and mix of traffic resulted in a decline in freight revenue from coal shipments in 2016 compared to 2015. shipments out of the powder river basin (prb) declined 24% in 2016 due to high inventory levels at utilities and competitive natural gas prices. shipments out of colorado and utah declined 15% compared to 2015 due to the same drivers, combined with lower international demand.   2016 coal carloads lower volume and fuel surcharge revenue, partially offset by core pricing gains, drove the decline in freight revenue from coal shipments in 2015 compared to 2014. shipments out of the prb declined 15% in 2015 as a result of depressed coal markets due to low natural gas prices and high inventory levels.  shipments out of the prb also were negatively impacted as heavy rains in june 2015 flooded coal mines and washed out tracks in some areas, impacting both second and third quarter shipments.  shipments out of colorado and utah declined 33% in 2015 primarily due to lower domestic demand for colorado and utah coal.  this lower demand was a result of several utilities switching to other fuel sources due to lower natural gas prices.  in addition, coal exports declined due to a soft global market.
industrial products - freight revenue from industrial products shipments decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to volume declines, lower fuel surcharge revenue, and mix of traffic partially offset by core pricing gains. declines in shale drilling activity, due to lower oil prices, negatively impacted non-metallic mineral (frac sand) shipments compared to 2015. rock shipments also decreased as weather events and flooding in the southern region during the second and third quarters limited construction activity, thus limiting demand for transportation of materials. in addition, steel shipments declined as a result of reductions in shale drilling activity and strong   2016 industrial products carloads import levels associated with the strength of the u.s. dollar.
freight revenue from industrial products shipments decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to volume declines, lower fuel surcharge revenue, and lower arc due to the mix of traffic, partially offset by core price improvements. declines in shale drilling activity due to lower oil prices decreased non-metallic mineral shipments (primarily frac sand carloadings).  steel shipments also declined as a result of reductions in shale drilling activity, low commodity prices, and increased imports associated with the strength of the u.s. dollar.  low commodity prices for lumber and the strong u.s. dollar resulted in reduced lumber shipments.
intermodal - freight revenue from intermodal shipments decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to lower volume and lower fuel surcharge revenue, which were partially offset by core pricing gains. volume levels from international and domestic traffic decreased 11% and 2%, respectively, compared to last year due to weaker global trade activity, softer domestic sales, high retail inventories, and a customer bankruptcy.   2016 intermodal carloads lower fuel surcharge revenue and volume declines, partially offset by core pricing gains, resulted in a decline in freight revenue from intermodal shipments in 2015 compared to
2014.  international shipments declined 8% resulting from the supply chain disruptions stemming from the west coast port work disruptions and historically high retail inventories. domestic volume increased 3% driven by continued conversions from trucks and new premium services, more than offsetting the impact of high retail inventory levels and modest retail sales activity.
mexico business - each of our commodity groups includes revenue from shipments to and from mexico. freight revenue from mexico business was $2.2 billion, flat with 2015.  lower fuel surcharge revenue and mix of traffic offset the 4% of volume growth and core pricing gains.  volume growth was driven by agricultural products, coal, and automotive parts shipments.
revenue from mexico business decreased 4% to $2.2 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower fuel surcharge revenue. volume levels were flat compared to 2014 as lower shipments of intermodal, agricultural products, and industrial products were offset by growth in automotive, coal, and chemical shipments.

operating expenses decreased $1.1 billion compared to 2015 driven by lower fuel prices, volume-related savings, productivity gains and lower locomotive and freight car maintenance expense. these cost reductions were partially offset by inflation, depreciation, and higher environmental and other costs.             2016 operating expenses operating expenses decreased nearly $1.5 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 driven by significantly lower fuel prices and volume-related cost savings. productivity gains in the second half of 2015 also drove expenses lower. these decreases were partially offset by wage inflation, higher depreciation, and property taxes.  in addition, we incurred approximately $35 million of weather-related costs in 2014.
compensation and benefits - compensation and benefits include wages, payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension costs, other postretirement benefits, and incentive costs. in 2016, expenses decreased 8% compared to 2015, driven by lower volume-related costs, productivity gains, and lower training expense.  general wage and benefit inflation partially offset these decreases.
in 2015, lower volume-related costs and second half productivity gains were more than offset by general wage inflation and increased hiring and training expenses related to a larger workforce in the first half of the year.
purchased services and materials - expense for purchased services and materials includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors and other service providers (including equipment maintenance and contract expenses incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services); materials used to maintain the railroad's lines, structures, and equipment; costs of operating facilities jointly used by uprr and other railroads; transportation and lodging for train crew employees; trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers; leased automobile maintenance expenses; and tools and supplies. purchased services and materials decreased 7% compared to 2015 primarily due to lower volume-related costs and lower locomotive and freight car repair and maintenance expenses.
purchased services and materials in 2015 decreased $137 million compared to 2014 primarily due to lower volume-related costs, including a decrease in external transportation expenses incurred by our logistics subsidiaries. expenses also decreased due to lower locomotive and freight car repair and maintenance expenses.
fuel - fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and non-highway vehicles and heavy equipment. locomotive diesel fuel prices, which averaged $1.48 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in 2016, compared to $1.84 per gallon in 2015, reduced expenses $347 million. in addition, fuel costs were lower as gross-ton miles decreased 8%. the fuel consumption rate (c-rate), computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles in thousands, improved 1% compared to 2015.
locomotive diesel fuel prices, which averaged $1.84 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in 2015, compared to $2.97 per gallon in 2014, reduced expenses $1.2 billion in 2015. in addition, fuel costs in 2015 were lower as gross-ton miles decreased 9%. the fuel consumption rate (c-rate), computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles in thousands, increased 1% in 2015 compared to 2014. decreases in heavier, more fuel-efficient shipments, decreased gross-ton miles and increased the c-rate.
depreciation - the majority of depreciation relates to road property, including rail, ties, ballast, and other track material.  a larger depreciable asset base, reflecting higher capital spending in recent years, increased depreciation expense in 2016 compared to 2015. this increase was partially offset by our recent depreciation studies that resulted in lower depreciation rates for some asset classes.
a higher depreciable asset base, reflecting higher capital spending in recent years, increased depreciation expense in 2015 compared to 2014. this increase was partially offset by our recent depreciation studies that resulted in lower depreciation rates for some asset classes.        equipment and other rents - equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies; freight car, intermodal, and locomotive leases; and office and other rent expenses. equipment and other rents expense decreased $93 million compared to 2015 as lower volume levels drove a reduction in car hire and locomotive lease expenses.
other - other expenses include state and local taxes, freight, equipment and property damage, utilities, insurance, personal injury, environmental, employee travel, telephone and cellular, computer software, bad debt, and other general expenses.  other expenses increased 8% in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of higher environmental costs, state and local taxes, bad debt expense (customer bankruptcy), and the write-off of certain in-progress capital projects that were cancelled.  these cost increases were partially offset by lower expenses for damaged freight, property, and equipment not owned by the company.
other expenses were flat in 2015 compared to 2014 as higher property taxes were offset by lower costs in other areas.

other income - other income decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to large real estate transactions: a $113 million gain from a real estate sale in 2015, partially offset by $67 million of gains from two real estate sales in 2016.
income taxes - lower pre-tax income decreased income taxes in 2016 compared to 2015. our effective tax rate for 2016 was 37.4% compared to 37.7% in 2015.
lower pre-tax income decreased income taxes in 2015 compared to 2014. our effective tax rate for 2015 was 37.7% compared to 37.9% in 2014.
other operating/performance and financial statistics we report a number of key performance measures weekly to the association of american railroads.  we provide this data on our website at www.up.com/investor/aar-stb_reports/index.htm.
operating/performance statistics railroad performance measures are included in the table below:
% change        % change average train speed (miles per hour)        26.6     25.4      24.0       5   %           6   %
average train speed - average train speed is calculated by dividing train miles by hours operated on our main lines between terminals.  average train speed, as reported to the association of american railroads, improved 5% in 2016 compared to 2015.  velocity gains resulted from lower volumes, improved network fluidity and a strong resource position.
average train speed improved 6% in 2015 compared to 2014.  velocity gains resulted from lower volumes, improved network fluidity and a strong resource position. more favorable weather conditions in the first quarter of 2015 also contributed to the improvement in our average train speed.
average terminal dwell time - average terminal dwell time is the average time that a rail car spends at our terminals. lower average terminal dwell time improves asset utilization and service. average terminal dwell time improved 4% in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting the impact of lower volume and improved network operations.
average terminal dwell time improved 3% in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting the impact of lower volume and improved network operations.
gross and revenue ton-miles - gross ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded and empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled. revenue ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the number of tariff miles.  gross ton-miles and revenue ton-miles decreased 8% and 9%, respectively in 2016 compared to 2015, resulting from a 7% decrease in carloads. changes in commodity mix drove the variances in year-over-year declines between gross ton-miles, revenue ton-miles and carloads.
gross ton-miles and revenue ton-miles decreased 9% and 12%, respectively in 2015 compared to 2014, resulting from a 6% decrease in carloads. changes in commodity mix drove the variances in year-over-year declines between gross ton-miles, revenue ton-miles and carloads.
operating ratio - operating ratio is our operating expenses reflected as a percentage of operating revenue.  our operating ratio increased 0.4 points to 63.5% in 2016 compared to 2015.  core price improvements, network efficiencies, and productivity gains were more than offset by the impact of lower volume, inflation, and other costs.
our operating ratio improved 0.4 points to a new record low of 63.1% in 2015 compared to 2014.  core pricing gains, the impact of lower fuel prices, resource realignments, network efficiencies and productivity gains more than offset the impact of lower volume and inflation.
employees - employee levels decreased 10% in 2016 compared to 2015, driven by lower volume levels, productivity gains, a smaller capital workforce, and fewer transportation employees in training.
employee levels increased 1% in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by more employees in training and an increase in capital project work. more employees were in training as a result of the number of transportation employees hired during the last half of 2014 and early 2015 to handle expected volume increases, and who continued receiving training in 2015, most of which occurred in the first nine months of the year.

adjusted debt to capital is a non-gaap financial measure under sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation s-k, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. we believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the total amount of leverage in our capital structure, including off-balance sheet lease obligations, which we generally incur in connection with financing the acquisition of locomotives and freight cars and certain facilities.  operating leases were discounted using 4.7% and 4.8% at december 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively. the discount rate reflects our effective interest rate. we monitor the ratio of adjusted debt to capital as we manage our capital structure to balance cost-effective and efficient access to the capital markets with our overall cost of capital. adjusted debt to capital should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, debt to capital. the tables above provide reconciliations from debt to capital to adjusted debt to capital. our december 31, 2016 debt to capital ratios increased as a result of an $800 million increase in debt from december 31, 2015.
liquidity and capital resources as of december 31, 2016, our principal sources of liquidity included cash, cash equivalents, our receivables securitization facility, and our revolving credit facility, as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets. we had $1.7 billion of committed credit available under our credit facility, with no borrowings outstanding as of december 31, 2016. we did not make any borrowings under this facility during 2016. the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the $650 million capacity receivables securitization facility was $0 as of december 31, 2016. our access to this receivables securitization facility may be reduced or restricted if our bond ratings fall to certain levels below investment grade. if our bond rating were to deteriorate, it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity. access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financings is dependent on market conditions. deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to access capital markets as a source of liquidity. access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability. we expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity through any or all of the following sources or activities: (i) increasing the size or utilization of our receivables securitization, (ii) issuing commercial paper, (iii) entering into bank loans, outside of our revolving credit facility, or (iv) issuing bonds or other debt securities to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit markets. the company's $1.7 billion revolving credit facility is intended to support the issuance of commercial paper by upc and also serves as an emergency source of liquidity. the company currently does not intend to make any borrowings under this facility.
at december 31, 2016, we had a working capital deficit, which does not indicate a lack of liquidity.  we maintain adequate resources and, when necessary, have adequate access to capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements, in addition to sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities.  the decrease at 2016 year-end was primarily due to a decrease in other current assets related to a tax receivable for the late extension of bonus depreciation at december 31, 2015, along with an increase at december 31, 2016, in accounts payable and upcoming debt maturities. at december 31, 2015, we had a working capital surplus.

operating activities cash provided by operating activities increased in 2016 compared to 2015.  the timing of tax payments primarily related to bonus depreciation and changes in working capital more than offset lower net income.
cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower net income and changes in working capital, partially offset by the timing of tax payments.
in december of 2014, congress extended 50% bonus depreciation for 2014; however the related benefit was realized in 2015, rather than 2014.  similarly, in december of 2015, congress extended bonus depreciation through 2019, which delayed the benefit of 2015 bonus depreciation into 2016.  bonus depreciation will be at a rate of 50% for 2016 and 2017, 40% for 2018 and 30% for 2019.
investing activities lower capital investments, partially offset by short-term investment purchases, decreased cash used in investing activities in 2016 compared to 2015.
higher capital investments in locomotives and freight cars, including $327 million in early lease buyouts, which we exercised due to favorable economic terms and market conditions, drove the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014.
the following tables detail cash capital investments and track statistics for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:
total road infrastructure replacements             1,837         1,860         1,746
line expansion and other capacity projects           153           457           515

[a]   other includes bridges and tunnels, signals, other road assets, and road work equipment.
[c]   technology and other includes the $261 million early buyout of our headquarters building operating lease in 2014.
track miles of rail capacity expansion            52           103           119
capital plan - in 2017, we expect our capital plan to be approximately $3.1 billion, which may be revised if business conditions or the regulatory environment affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments.  while asset replacements will fluctuate as part of our renewal strategy, we expect to use 65% to 75% of our capital investments to renew and improve existing capital assets.  we will continue to invest in our network and terminals where appropriate, balancing terminal capacity with mainline capacity.  significant investments in technology improvements are planned, including approximately $300 million for ptc.  we also will continue commercial investments in rail facilities and equipment, including approximately 60 locomotives, intermodal containers and chassis, and freight cars.
we expect to fund our 2017 cash capital plan by using some or all of the following: cash generated from operations, proceeds from the sale or lease of various operating and non-operating properties, proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, and cash on hand. our annual capital plan is a critical component of our long-term strategic plan. we expect our plan will enhance the long-term value of the company for our shareholders by providing sufficient resources to (i) replace and improve our existing track infrastructure to provide safe and fluid operations, (ii) increase network efficiency by adding or improving facilities and track, and (iii) make investments that meet customer demand and take advantage of opportunities for long-term growth.
financing activities cash used in financing activities increased in 2016 compared to 2015. an increase of $457 million in debt repaid and a decrease of $1,345 million in debt issued more than offset a decrease of $465 million in dividends paid. the decrease in dividends paid was a result of adjusting the dividend payable dates in 2015 to align with the timing of the quarterly dividend declaration and payment dates within the same quarter. aligning the quarterly dividend declaration and payment resulted in two payments in the first quarter of 2015: the fourth quarter 2014 dividend of $438 million, which was paid on january 2, 2015, as well as the first quarter 2015 dividend of $484 million, which was paid on march 30, 2015. the second quarter 2015 dividend of $479 million was paid on june 30, 2015, the third quarter 2015 dividend of $476 million was paid on september 30, 2015, and the fourth quarter 2015 dividend of $467 million was paid on december 31, 2015.
cash used in financing activities increased in 2015 compared to 2014. an increase of $712 million in dividends paid and $240 million for the repurchase of shares under our common stock repurchase program more than offset an increase of $740 million in debt issued and a decrease of $154 million in debt repaid. the higher dividend payments primarily were a result of adjusting the dividend payable dates to align with the timing of the quarterly dividend declaration and payment within the same quarter as mentioned above.  higher dividends per share also contributed to the increase in dividends paid.
see note 15 of the consolidated financial statements for a description of all our outstanding financing arrangements and significant new borrowings.
ratio of earnings to fixed charges for each of the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 9.6, 11.6, and 13.5, respectively. the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis. earnings represent income from continuing operations, less equity earnings net of distributions, plus fixed charges and income taxes. fixed charges represent interest charges, amortization of debt discount, and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges.  (see exhibit 12 to this report for the calculation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges.)
common shareholders' equity dividend restrictions - our revolving credit facility includes a debt-to-net worth covenant (discussed in the credit facilities section above) that, under certain circumstances, restricts the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders. the amount of retained earnings available for dividends was $12.4 billion and $13.6 billion at december 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
management's assessments of market conditions and other pertinent facts guide the timing and volume of all repurchases.  we expect to fund any share repurchases under this program through cash generated from operations, the sale or lease of various operating and non-operating properties, debt issuances, and cash on hand.  repurchased shares are recorded in treasury stock at cost, which includes any applicable commissions and fees.
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and as referenced in the tables below, we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition. based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, including material sources of off-balance sheet and structured finance arrangements, other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets (as described in item 1a of part ii of this report),  there is no known trend, demand, commitment, event, or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. in addition, our commercial obligations, financings, and commitments are customary transactions that are similar to those of other comparable corporations, particularly within the transportation industry.
the following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of december 31, 2016:
capital lease obligations [c]                 1,355           221         193         179         187         158           417        -
other post retirement benefits [e]              465            47          47          47          47          47           230        -
[a]   excludes capital lease obligations of $1,105 million, as well as unamortized discount and deferred issuance costs of $(894) million. includes an interest component of $10,496 million.
[b]   includes leases for locomotives, freight cars, other equipment, and real estate.
[d]   purchase obligations include locomotive maintenance contracts; purchase commitments for fuel purchases, locomotives, ties, ballast, and rail; and agreements to purchase other goods and services. for amounts where we cannot reasonably estimate the year of settlement, they are reflected in the other column.
[e]   includes estimated other post retirement, medical, and life insurance payments, payments made under the unfunded pension plan for the next ten years.
[f]   future cash flows for income tax contingencies reflect the recorded liabilities and assets for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, as of december 31, 2016. for amounts where the year of settlement is uncertain, they are reflected in the other column.
amount of commitment expiration per period other commercial commitments                                                                                              after millions                                        total        2017        2018        2019        2020        2021          2021

[a]   none of the credit facility was used as of december 31, 2016.
[b]   none of the receivables securitization facility was utilized as of december 31, 2016. the full program matures in july 2019.
[d]   none of the letters of credit were drawn upon as of december 31, 2016.
off-balance sheet arrangements guarantees - at december 31, 2016, and 2015, we were contingently liable for $43 million and $53 million in guarantees. the fair value of these obligations as of both december 31, 2016, and 2015, was $0. we entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business, and they include guaranteed obligations related to our affiliated operations. the final guarantee expires in 2022. we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees. we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.     other matters labor agreements - approximately 84% of our 42,919 full-time-equivalent employees are represented by 14 major rail unions. on january 1, 2015, current labor agreements became subject to modification and we began the current round of negotiations with the unions. existing agreements remain in effect until new agreements are reached or the railway labor act's (rla) procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods, and the possibility of presidential emergency boards and congressional intervention) are exhausted.  the railroad industry is currently in mediation with all bargaining coalitions.  under the railway labor act, the national mediation board controls timing and location of mediation conferences and when to terminate mediation, moving the parties to the next stages of the rla process.  contract negotiations historically continue for an extended period of time and we rarely experience work stoppages while negotiations are pending.
inflation - long periods of inflation significantly increase asset replacement costs for capital-intensive companies. as a result, assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels, depreciation charges (on an inflation-adjusted basis) would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts.
sensitivity analyses - the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition. these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results.
market risk for fixed-rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31, 2016, and amounts to an increase of approximately $1.9 billion to the fair value of our debt at december 31, 2016. we estimated the fair values of our fixed-rate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates.
accounting pronouncements - see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.
asserted and unasserted claims - various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries. we cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. to the extent possible, we have recorded a liability where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated. we do not expect that any known lawsuits, claims, environmental costs, commitments, contingent liabilities, or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity after taking into account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters.
indemnities - our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements, including certain tax indemnifications, can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount, depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements. due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved, we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements. we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions.
climate change - although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance in the future (see risk factors under item 1a of this report), we are currently unable to predict the manner or severity of such impact. however, we continue to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment, including investments in new technologies, using training programs to reduce fuel consumption, and changing our operations to increase fuel efficiency.
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note 2 to the financial statements and supplementary data, item 8. these critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates. if these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material.
personal injury - the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year. we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability, including unasserted claims. the federal employers' liability act (fela) governs compensation for work-related accidents. under fela, damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out-of-court settlements. we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work.
our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments. approximately 94% of the recorded liability is related to asserted claims and approximately 6% is related to unasserted claims at december 31, 2016. because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims, it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately $290 million to $317 million. we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other.  estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation.
our personal injury liability activity was as follows:
changes in estimates for prior years                  (29)          (3)           9
our personal injury claims activity was as follows:
in conjunction with the liability update performed in 2016, we also reassessed our estimated insurance recoveries. we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december 31, 2016, and 2015. any changes to recorded insurance recoveries are included in the above table in the changes in estimates for prior years category.
asbestos - we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees and other parties allege exposure to asbestos. we assess our potential liability using a statistical analysis of resolution costs for asbestos-related claims.  this liability is updated annually and excludes future defense and processing costs. the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions:
·   the ratio of future claims by alleged disease would be consistent with historical averages adjusted for inflation.
·   the number of claims filed against us will decline each year.
·   the average settlement values for asserted and unasserted claims will be equivalent to historical averages.
our liability for asbestos-related claims is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments. approximately 20% of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 80% related to unasserted claims at december 31, 2016.  because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of asbestos-related claims, it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately $111 million to $118 million.  we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other.
our asbestos-related liability activity was as follows:
accruals/(credits)                                      12          -          1
our asbestos-related claims activity was as follows:
in conjunction with the liability update performed in 2016, we also reassessed our estimated insurance recoveries. we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december 31, 2016, and 2015.  the amounts recorded for asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts. however, future events, such as the number of new claims filed each year, average settlement costs, and insurance coverage issues, could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts. estimates also may vary in the future if strategies, activities, and outcomes of asbestos litigation materially change; federal and state laws governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of claimants; and there are material changes with respect to payments made to claimants by other defendants.
environmental costs - we are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. we have identified 292 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements. this includes 33 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the u.s. government, 21 of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list. certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites; consequently, our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties, in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site.
when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned, leased, or otherwise used in our business, we perform, with assistance of our consultants, environmental assessments on the property. we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred. we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated. our environmental liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments.
our environmental liability activity was as follows:
our environmental site activity was as follows:
open sites, beginning balance                290    270    268
new sites                                     85     66     55
closed sites                                (83)   (46)   (53)
open sites, ending balance at december 31    292    290    270
the environmental liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites, as well as ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties. cost estimates are based on information available for each site, financial viability of other potentially responsible parties, and existing technology, laws, and regulations. the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties, site-specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties, the degree of contamination by various wastes, the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites, and the speculative nature of remediation costs. estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal, state, and local laws governing environmental remediation. current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.
property and depreciation - our railroad operations are highly capital intensive, and our large base of homogeneous, network-type assets turns over on a continuous basis.  each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enable us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers.  assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria.  properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated service lives, which are measured in years, except for rail in high-density traffic corridors (i.e., all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment, yard and switching tracks, and electronic yards) for which lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track.  we use the group method of depreciation in which all items with similar characteristics, use, and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes, and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates.  the group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources, not as singular items.  we currently have more than 60 depreciable asset classes, and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology, asset strategies, or other factors.
we determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property by means of depreciation studies.  we perform depreciation studies at least every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets (i.e., rail and other track material, ties, and ballast) and other road property.  our depreciation studies take into account the following factors:
·   evaluation of any expected changes in current operations and the outlook for continued use of the assets;
·   evaluation of technological advances and changes to maintenance practices; and for rail in high-density traffic corridors, we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track.  it has been our experience that the lives of rail in high-density traffic corridors are closely correlated to usage (i.e., the amount of weight carried over the rail).  the service lives also vary based on rail weight, rail condition (e.g., new or secondhand), and rail type (e.g., straight or curve).  our depreciation studies for rail in high-density traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives.  for rail in high-density traffic corridors, we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross ton-miles carried over the rail (i.e., the weight of loaded and empty freight cars, locomotives and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail) by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile.  rail in high-density traffic corridors accounts for approximately 70 percent of the historical cost of rail and other track material.  based on the number of gross ton-miles carried over our rail in high density traffic corridors during 2016, the estimated service lives of the majority of this rail ranged from approximately 20 years to approximately 42 years.  for all other depreciable assets, we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives of our assets as determined from the analysis of our depreciation studies.  changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively.
estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property may vary over time due to changes in physical use, technology, asset strategies, and other factors that will have an impact on the retirement profiles of our assets.  we are not aware of any specific factors that are reasonably likely to significantly change the estimated service lives of our assets.  actual use and retirement of our assets may vary from our current estimates, which would impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in future periods.
changes in estimated useful lives of our assets due to the results of our depreciation studies could significantly impact future periods' depreciation expense and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year, annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately $65 million.  if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were decreased by one year, annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately $70 million.  our recent depreciation studies have resulted in lower depreciation rates for some asset classes. these lower rates will partially offset the impact of a projected higher depreciable asset base, resulting in an increase in total depreciation expense by approximately 3% to 4% in 2017 versus 2016.
under group depreciation, the historical cost (net of salvage) of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized.  the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using (i) inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and (ii) the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies.  the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes.  because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired, we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate.  in addition, we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies.  any deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets.
for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business, a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions: (i) it is unusual, (ii) it is material in amount, and (iii) it varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies.  during the last three fiscal years, no gains or losses were recognized due to the retirement of depreciable railroad properties.  a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations.
income taxes - we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. these expected future tax consequences are measured based on current tax law; the effects of future tax legislation are not anticipated.  future tax legislation, such as a change in the corporate tax rate, could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.  for example, a permanent 1% increase in future income tax rates would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately $410 million. similarly, a permanent 1% decrease in future income tax rates would decrease our deferred tax liability by approximately $410 million.
when appropriate, we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reflect that these tax assets may not be realized. in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, based on management's judgments using available evidence for purposes of estimating whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize a deferred tax asset. in 2017 and 2016, there were no valuation allowances.
we recognize tax benefits that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement. a liability for "unrecognized tax benefits" is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards.
pension and other postretirement benefits - we use an actuarial analysis to measure the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and medical and life insurance benefits (opeb) to eligible employees. in order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses, we must make several assumptions. the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rates and expected rate of return on pension assets. for opeb, the critical assumptions are the discount rates and health care cost trend rate.
we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually, and selected assumptions are based on the following factors:
·   beginning in 2016, we measure the service cost and interest cost components of our net periodic benefit cost by using individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year. discount rates are based on a mercer yield curve of high quality corporate bonds (rated aa by a recognized rating agency).
·   expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return, taking into consideration current and expected market conditions.
·   health care cost trend rate is based on our historical rates of inflation and expected market conditions.
the following tables present the key assumptions used to measure net periodic pension and opeb cost/(benefit) for 2017 and the estimated impact on 2017 net periodic pension and opeb cost/(benefit) relative to a change in those assumptions:

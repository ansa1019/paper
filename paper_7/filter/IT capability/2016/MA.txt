item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of mastercard incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including mastercard international incorporated ("mastercard international") (together, "mastercard" or the "company"), included elsewhere in this report. in the fourth quarter of 2016, the company began using the term "switched" transactions instead of "processed" transactions to differentiate our authorization, clearing and settlement activities from our issuer/acquirer processing activities. this change only relates to terminology; no previously reported amounts have changed. percentage changes provided throughout "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" were calculated on amounts rounded to the nearest thousand.
non-gaap financial information non-gaap financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company's performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap").  see "overview" for the tables that provide reconciliations of the non-gaap operating results and growth to the most directly comparable gaap measures. this report contains non-gaap financial measures that exclude the impact of the following special items ("special items"):
•   in 2016 and 2015, the company recorded provisions for litigation of $117 million ($85 million after tax, or $0.08 per diluted share) and $61 million ($44 million after tax, or $0.04 per diluted share), respectively, related to litigations with merchants in the u.k.
•   in 2015, the company recorded a settlement charge of $79 million ($50 million after tax, or $0.04 per diluted share) relating to the termination of its qualified u.s. defined benefit pension plan in general and administrative expenses (the "u.s. employee pension plan settlement charge").
the provisions for litigation for both years discussed above relate to separate merchant litigations in the u.k. (collectively the "u.k. merchant litigation provision"). see note 18 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 for further discussion. mastercard excluded the u.k. merchant litigation provision because its management monitors material litigation judgments and settlements separately from ongoing operations and evaluates ongoing performance without these amounts. the company also excluded the u.s. employee pension plan settlement charge because its management monitors significant one-time items separately from ongoing operations and evaluates ongoing performance without these amounts. for additional discussion regarding the u.s. employee pension plan settlement charge, see note 11 (pension, postretirement and savings plans) in part ii, item 8.
mastercard presents growth rates adjusted for the impact of foreign currency, which is a non-gaap financial measure. for 2016, the company presents currency-neutral growth rates, which are calculated by remeasuring the prior period's results using the current period's exchange rates for both the translational and transactional impacts on operating results. prior to 2016, the impact of foreign currency on our operating results were presented to include only translational impacts. the impact of foreign currency translation represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our u.s. dollar reporting currency. the impact of the transactional foreign currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in a currency other than the functional currency. mastercard's management believes the presentation of the impact of foreign currency provides relevant information.
mastercard's management believes that the non-gaap financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of mastercard's operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of its results between periods. mastercard's management uses non-gaap financial measures to, among other things, evaluate its ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. the presentation of non-gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company's related financial results prepared in accordance with gaap.

excluding the impact of special items, we had adjusted net income of $4.1 billion, or $3.77 per adjusted diluted share in 2016, versus adjusted net income of $3.9 billion, or $3.43 per adjusted diluted share in 2015. adjusted net income increased 6%, or 7% on a currency-neutral basis, in 2016 versus 2015. in addition, adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 10%, or 11% on a currency-neutral basis, in 2016 versus 2015.
key highlights for 2016 were as follows:
•   net revenue increased 11%, or 13% on a currency-neutral basis, in 2016 versus 2015, primarily driven by increases across revenue categories, partially offset by higher rebates and incentives. switched transaction growth of 16%, cross border growth of 12% and gross dollar volume increase of 11%, on a local currency basis and adjusted for the impact of the recent eu regulation change, contributed to the net revenue growth.
•   operating expenses increased 9% in 2016 versus 2015. excluding the impact of special items, adjusted operating expenses increased 10%, or 12% on a currency-neutral basis, in 2016 versus 2015. the increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs due to continued investment in our strategic initiatives, lapping the favorable impact of foreign exchange activity gains recognized in 2015 and higher data processing expenses.
•   total other expense decreased 5% in 2016 versus 2015, due to lower impairment charges and higher investment income in 2016, that were partially offset by higher interest expense from debt issued in 2015 and 2016.
•   the effective income tax rate increased 4.9 percentage points to 28.1% in 2016 versus 23.2% in 2015, primarily due to lapping of the favorable impact of settlements with tax authorities and the recognition of u.s. foreign tax credit benefits in 2015.
other financial highlights for 2016 were as follows:
•   we completed a debt offering for an aggregate principal amount of $2 billion.
•   we repurchased 37 million shares of our class a common stock for $3.5 billion in 2016.
business environment we process transactions from more than 210 countries and territories and in more than 150 currencies. net revenue generated in the united states was 38% of total revenue in 2016 and 39% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. no individual country, other than the united states, generated more than 10% of total revenue in any such period, but differences in market growth, economic health and foreign exchange fluctuations in certain countries can have an impact on the proportion of revenue generated outside the united states over time. while the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries, the significant concentration of our revenue generated in the united states makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the united states.
the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business. adverse economic trends (including distress in financial markets, turmoil in specific economies around the world and additional government intervention) have impacted the environment in which we operate. certain of our customers, merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands, have been directly impacted by these adverse economic conditions.
mastercard's financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies. in addition, political instability or a decline in economic conditions in the countries in which the company operates may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance. as a result, our revenue or results of operations may be negatively impacted. mastercard continues to monitor political and economic conditions around the world to identify opportunities for the continued growth of our business and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry. notwithstanding recent encouraging trends, the extent and pace of economic recovery in various regions remains uncertain and the overall business environment may present challenges for mastercard to grow its business.
for a full discussion of the various legal, regulatory and business risks that could impact our financial results, see "risk factors" in part i, item 1a.
impact of foreign currency rates our overall operating results are impacted by foreign currency translation, which represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our u.s. dollar reporting currency.
our operating results can also be impacted by transactional foreign currency. the impact of the transactional foreign currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expense transactions occurring in a currency other than the functional currency. changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume ("gdv") and gross euro volume ("gev"), which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and volume-related rebates and incentives. in most non-european regions, gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to u.s. dollars using average exchange rates for the period. in europe, gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period. as a result, our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and volume-related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar versus non-european local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus other european local currencies. for example, our billing in australia is in the u.s. dollar, however, consumer spend in australia is in the australian dollar. the foreign currency transactional impact of converting australian dollars to our u.s. dollar billing currency will have an impact on the revenue generated. the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar is evident when gdv growth on a u.s. dollar-converted basis is compared to gdv growth on a local currency basis. in 2016, gdv on a u.s. dollar-converted basis increased 6%, while gdv on a local currency basis increased 9% versus 2015. in 2015, gdv on a u.s. dollar-converted basis increased 2%, while gdv on a local currency basis increased 13% versus 2014. further, the impact from transactional foreign currency occurs in transaction processing revenue, other revenue and operating expenses when the local currency of these items are different than the functional currency.
the following table provides a summary of the foreign currency impact on growth for the following items in operating results for the years ended december 31, 2016, and 2015:
positive (negative) impact from foreign currency
1 excludes the impact from special items.
2 represents the foreign currency translational and transactional impact versus 2015.
3 represents the foreign currency translational impact versus 2014.
in addition, the company incurs foreign currency gains and losses from remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are in a currency other than the functional currency and from remeasuring foreign exchange derivative contracts ("foreign exchange activity"). the impact of foreign exchange activity has not been eliminated in our currency-neutral results (see "non-gaap financial information") and is recorded in general and administrative expenses. the company attempts to manage foreign currency balance sheet remeasurement and cash flow risk through its foreign exchange risk management activities, which are discussed further in note 20 (foreign exchange risk management) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8. since the company does not designate foreign currency derivatives as hedging instruments pursuant to the accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, it records gains and losses on foreign exchange derivatives on a current basis, with the associated offset being recognized as the exposures materialize.
the company generates revenue and has financial assets in countries at risk for currency devaluation. while these revenues and financial assets are not material to mastercard on a consolidated basis, they could be negatively impacted if a devaluation of local currencies occurs relative to the u.s. dollar.
financial results revenue revenue description mastercard's business model involves four participants in addition to us: cardholders, merchants, issuers (the cardholders' financial institutions) and acquirers (the merchants' financial institutions). our gross revenue is generated by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on the cards and other devices that carry our brands and from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related products and services. our revenue is based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers. our primary revenue billing currencies are the u.s. dollar, euro and brazilian real.
the price structure for our products and services is complex and is dependent on the nature of volumes, types of transactions and type of products and services we offer to our customers. our net revenue can be significantly impacted by the following:
•   domestic or cross-border transactions
•   signature-based or pin-based transactions
•   geographic region or country in which the transaction occurs
•   volumes/transactions subject to tiered rates
•   processed or not processed by mastercard
•   amount of rebates and incentives provided to customers the company classifies its net revenue into the following five categories:
1.   domestic assessments are fees charged to issuers and acquirers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry our brands where the merchant country and the issuer country are the same. domestic assessments include items such as card assessments, which are fees charged on the number of cards issued or assessments for specific purposes, such as acceptance development or market development programs.
2.   cross-border volume fees are charged to issuers and acquirers based on the dollar volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry our brands where the merchant country and the issuer country are different. in general, a cross-border transaction generates higher revenue than a domestic transaction since cross-border fees are higher than domestic fees, and may include fees for currency conversion.
3.   transaction processing revenue is earned for both domestic and cross-border transactions and is primarily based on the number of transactions. transaction processing includes the following:
•   switched transactions include the following products and services:
ø   authorization is the process by which a transaction is routed to the issuer for approval. in certain circumstances, such as when the issuer's systems are unavailable or cannot be contacted, mastercard or others, on behalf of the issuer approve in accordance with either the issuer's instructions or applicable rules (also known as "stand-in").
ø   clearing is the determination and exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has been successfully conducted at the point of interaction. mastercard clears transactions among customers through our central and regional processing systems.
ø   settlement is facilitating the exchange of funds between parties.
•   connectivity fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for network access, equipment and the transmission of authorization and settlement messages. these fees are based on the size of the data being transmitted and the number of connections to the company's network.
•   other processing fees include issuer and acquirer processing solutions; payment gateways for e-commerce merchants; and mobile gateways for mobile initiated transactions.
4.   other revenues: other revenues consist of other payment-related products and services and are primarily associated with the following:
•   consulting, data analytic and research fees are primarily generated by mastercard advisors, the company's professional advisory services group.
•   safety and security services fees are for products and services we offer to prevent, detect and respond to fraud and to ensure the safety of transactions made on mastercard products. we work with issuers, merchants and governments to help deploy standards for safe and secure transactions for the global payments system.
•   loyalty and rewards solutions fees are charged to issuers for benefits provided directly to consumers with mastercard-branded cards, such as access to a global airline lounge network, global and local concierge services, individual insurance coverages, emergency card replacement, emergency cash advance services and a 24-hour cardholder service center. for merchants, we provide targeted offers and rewards campaigns and management services for publishing offers, as well as opportunities for holders of co-brand or loyalty cards and rewards program members to obtain rewards points faster.
•   program management services provided to prepaid card issuers consist of foreign exchange margin, commissions, load fees, and atm withdrawal fees paid by cardholders on the sale and encashment of prepaid cards.
•   the company also charges for a variety of other payment-related products and services, including account and transaction enhancement services, rules compliance and publications.
5.   rebates and incentives (contra-revenue): rebates and incentives are provided to certain mastercard customers and are recorded as contra-revenue.
revenue analysis gross revenue in 2016 and 2015 increased 14% and 7% versus 2015 and 2014, respectively. the increases in 2016 versus 2015 and 2015 versus 2014 were primarily driven by an increase in dollar volume of activity and number of transactions on cards carrying our brands, as well as growth in our advisors business, which includes the impact of our data analytics business acquired in 2015, partially offset by the negative impact from foreign currency translation and the foreign currency impact on local billing.
rebates and incentives in 2016 and 2015 increased 20% for both periods, versus 2015 and 2014. the increases in rebates and incentives in 2016 versus 2015 and 2015 versus 2014 were primarily due to the impact from new and renewed agreements and increased volumes, partially offset by the positive impact of foreign currency translation.
the following table provides a summary of the trend in volume and transaction growth:
united states                          6        %              6         %             8        %              8         %

in 2016, our gdv was impacted by new eu interchange fee regulation related to card payments. the regulation was effective in june 2016 and required that we no longer collect fees on domestic european economic area payment transactions that do not use our network brand. prior to that, mastercard collected a de minimis assessment fee in a few countries, particularly france, on transactions with mastercard co-badged cards if the brands of domestic networks (as opposed to mastercard) were used. as a result, the non-mastercard co-badged volume is no longer being included.
the following table reflects gdv growth rates for europe and worldwide mastercard. for comparability purposes, we adjusted growth rates for the impact of article 8 of the eu interchange fee regulation related to card payments, to exclude the prior period co-badged volume processed by other networks.
for the years ended december 31, worldwide as adjusted for eu regulation          11%                       13%
europe as adjusted for eu regulation             18%                       19%
a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers. in 2016, the net revenue from these customers was approximately $2.5 billion, or 23%, of total net revenue. the loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenue. in addition, as part of our business strategy, mastercard, among other efforts, enters into business agreements with customers. these agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances. see our risk factor in "risk factor - business risks" in part i, item 1a for further discussion.

general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased 11% in 2016 versus 2015 and increased 6% in 2015 versus 2014. excluding the impact of the u.s. employee pension plan settlement charge, adjusted general and administrative expenses increased 14% in 2016 versus 2015 and increased 3% in 2015 versus 2014. in 2016, adjusted general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher personnel cost and the lapping of the impact of foreign exchange activity gains in 2015, partially offset by improved cost controls. in 2015, the increase was due to acquisitions and higher data processing costs, partially offset by improved cost controls, the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, lapping of the impact of the restructuring charge taken in 2014 and foreign exchange activity gains.

1 see "non-gaap financial information" for further information on special items.
the primary drivers of changes in general and administrative expenses in 2016 and 2015 were:
•   personnel expenses increased 6% in 2016 versus 2015 and 2% in 2015 versus 2014. these percentage changes include the impact of the u.s. employee pension plan settlement charge of $79 million recorded in 2015, which decreased personnel expense growth by 4 percentage points for 2016 and increased it by 4 percentage points for 2015. excluding the impact of the u.s. employee pension plan settlement charge, adjusted personnel expense grew 10% for 2016 versus 2015 and decreased 2% for 2015 versus 2014. the adjusted 2016 increase was driven by a higher number of employees to support our continued investment in the areas of digital, services, data analytics and geographic expansion. the adjusted 2015 decrease was due to the lapping of the restructuring charge of $87 million recorded in 2014 and improved cost controls, partially offset by an increase in the number of employees resulting from our acquisitions.
•   professional fees consist primarily of third-party services, legal costs to defend our outstanding litigation and the evaluation of regulatory developments that impact our industry and brand. the increase in 2016 versus 2015 is primarily due to higher legal costs to defend litigation. professional fees remained consistent in 2015 versus 2014.
•   data processing and telecommunication expense consists of expenses to support our global payments network infrastructure, expenses to operate and maintain our computer systems and other telecommunication system. these expenses increased in both 2016 and 2015 due to capacity growth of our business and higher third-party processing costs.
•   foreign exchange activity includes gains and losses on foreign exchange derivative contracts and the impact of remeasurement of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. see note 20 (foreign exchange risk management) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 for further discussion. during 2016, foreign exchange activity negatively impacted general and administrative expense growth by 4 percentage points versus the comparable period in 2015, due to the impact from foreign exchange derivative contracts and the lapping of balance sheet remeasurement gains in the prior year. in 2015 versus 2014, we recorded higher gains on derivative contracts, as well as balance sheet remeasurement gains related primarily to the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar.
•   other expenses include costs to provide loyalty and rewards solutions, travel and meeting expenses and rental expense for our facilities. other expenses increased in 2016 primarily due to higher cardholder services and loyalty costs. other expenses increased in 2015 primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and expenses incurred to support strategic development efforts including costs associated with loyalty and rewards programs.
advertising and marketing in 2016, advertising and marketing expenses decreased 1% versus 2015, mainly due to lower sponsorship promotions in the current year. advertising and marketing expenses decreased 5% in 2015, mainly due to the favorable impact from foreign currency translation and lower media spend, partially offset by higher sponsorship promotions to support our strategic initiatives. see value-added solutions and marketing sections included in part i, item 1 for further discussion of our marketing strategy.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses increased 2% in 2016 versus 2015 and increased 14% in 2015 versus 2014. the increase in 2016 was primarily due to higher depreciation from capital investments partially offset by certain intangibles becoming fully amortized. in 2015, the increase was primarily due to higher amortization of capitalized software costs and other intangibles associated with our acquisitions.
provision for litigation settlements during 2016 and 2015, the company recorded pre-tax charges of $117 million and $61 million, respectively, related to litigations with merchants in the u.k. see note 18 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 for further discussion.
other income (expense) is comprised primarily of investment income, interest expense, our share of income (losses) from equity method investments and other gains and losses. total other expense decreased to $115 million in 2016 versus $120 million in 2015 due to lower impairment charges taken on certain investments and higher investment income in 2016, partially offset by higher interest expense from debt issued in 2015 and 2016. total other expense increased in 2015 versus 2014 primarily due to impairment charges taken on certain investments in 2015 and higher interest expense resulting from incremental debt issued in 2014 and 2015.
income taxes the effective income tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were 28.1%, 23.2% and 28.8%, respectively.
the effective income tax rate for 2016 was higher than the effective income tax rate for 2015 primarily due to benefits associated with the impact of settlements with tax authorities in multiple jurisdictions in 2015, the lapping of a discrete benefit relating to certain foreign taxes that became eligible to be claimed as credits in the united states in 2015, and a higher u.s. foreign tax credit benefit associated with the repatriation of current year foreign earnings in 2015. these items were partially offset by a more favorable geographic mix of taxable earnings in 2016.
the effective income tax rate for 2015 was lower than the effective income tax rate for 2014 primarily due to settlements with tax authorities in multiple jurisdictions. further, the information gained related to these matters was considered in measuring uncertain tax benefits recognized for the periods subsequent to the periods settled. in addition, the recognition of other u.s. foreign tax credits and a more favorable geographic mix of taxable earnings also contributed to the lower effective tax rate in 2015.
the provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate of 35% to pretax income for the years ended december 31, as a result of the following:
for the years ended december 31, income before income taxes                      $5,646                                 $4,958                                 $5,079
state tax effect, net of federal benefit            22              0.4     %   27                         0.5     %   29                         0.6     %
foreign tax effect                                (188    )        (3.3    )%            (144    )        (2.9    )%            (108    )        (2.1    )%
impact of foreign tax credits 1                   (141    )        (2.5    )%            (281    )        (5.7    )%            (183    )        (3.6    )%
impact of settlements with tax authorities           -                -     %            (147    )        (2.9    )%               -                -     %
1 included within the impact of foreign tax credits were repatriation benefits of current year foreign earnings of $116 million, $172 million and $177 million, in addition to other foreign tax credit benefits which become eligible in the united states of $25 million, $109 million and $6 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
the company's gaap effective income tax rates for 2016 and 2015 were affected by the tax benefits related to the special items as previously discussed.
as of december 31, 2016, the company's unrecognized tax benefits related to positions taken during the current and prior period were $169 million, all of which would reduce the company's effective tax rate if recognized. see note 17 (income taxes) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 for further discussion. within the next twelve months, we believe that the resolution of certain federal, foreign and state and local tax examinations is reasonably possible and that a change in estimate, reducing unrecognized tax benefits, may occur. it is not possible to provide a range of the potential change until the examinations progress further or the related statute of limitations expire. during 2015, the company's unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken during the current and prior periods decreased by $183 million. this decrease was primarily due to settlements with tax authorities in multiple jurisdictions. further, the information gained related to these matters was considered in measuring uncertain tax benefits recognized for the periods subsequent to the periods settled.
during the fourth quarter of 2014, we implemented an initiative to better align our legal entity and tax structure with our operational footprint outside of the u.s. this initiative resulted in a one-time taxable gain in belgium relating to the transfer of intellectual property to a related foreign entity in the united kingdom. we believe this improved alignment will result in greater flexibility and efficiency with regard to the global deployment of cash, as well as ongoing benefits in our effective income tax rate. see note 17 (income taxes) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 for further discussion.
in 2010, in connection with the expansion of the company's operations in the asia pacific, middle east and africa region, the company's subsidiary in singapore, mastercard asia pacific pte. ltd. ("mappl"), received an incentive grant from the singapore ministry of finance. see note 17 (income taxes) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 for further discussion.
liquidity and capital resources we need liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations, credit and settlement exposure, capital expenditures, investments in our business and current and potential obligations. the company generates the cash required to meet these needs through operations. the following table summarizes the cash, cash equivalents, investments and credit available to the company at december 31:
cash, cash equivalents and investments 1      $8.3              $6.7
unused line of credit                          3.8               3.8
1 investments include available-for-sale securities and short-term held-to-maturity securities.  at december 31, 2016 and 2015, this amount excludes restricted cash related to the u.s. merchant class litigation settlement of $543 million and $541 million, respectively. this amount also excludes restricted security deposits held for customers of $991 million and $895 million at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
cash, cash equivalents and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries (i.e., any entities where earnings would be subject to u.s. tax upon repatriation) was $3.8 billion and $3.3 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, or 45% and 48% as of such dates. it is our present intention to indefinitely reinvest historic undistributed accumulated earnings associated with our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31, 2016 outside of the united states (as disclosed in note 17 (income taxes) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8), and our current plans do not require repatriation of these earnings. if these earnings are needed for u.s. operations or can no longer be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states, the company would be required to record a liability for such u.s. taxes for the historic undistributed accumulated earnings at that time. such taxes would be due upon repatriation of such earnings to the united states.
our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions. the company guarantees the settlement of many mastercard, cirrus and maestro-branded transactions between our issuers and acquirers. see note 19 (settlement and other risk management) to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 for a description of these guarantees. historically, payments under these guarantees have not been significant; however, historical trends may not be an indication of the future. the risk of loss on these guarantees is specific to individual customers, but may also be driven significantly by regional or global economic conditions, including, but not limited to the health of the financial institutions in a country or region.
our liquidity and access to capital could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. see our risk factor in "risk factors - legal and regulatory risks" in part i, item 1a and note 18 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8; and part ii, item 7 (business environment) for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business.
cash flow the table below shows a summary of the cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended december 31:
cash flow data:
net cash provided by operating activities                $4,484              $4,043              $3,407
net cash (used in) provided by investing activities      (1,167   )            (715   )             690
net cash used in financing activities                    (2,293   )          (2,458   )          (2,339   )
net cash provided by operating activities increased $441 million in 2016 versus 2015, primarily due to higher net income as adjusted for non-cash items and accrued expenses, partially offset by higher prepaid taxes. net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 versus 2014, increased by $636 million, primarily due to lower prepaid taxes and higher net income, partially offset by timing of customer settlements.
net cash used in investing activities increased $452 million in 2016 versus 2015, primarily due to lower sales and maturities of our investment securities, partially offset by cash used for acquisition activities in the prior year. the $1.4 billion decrease in investing activities in 2015 versus 2014 was primarily due to the higher proceeds from the sales and maturities of investment securities in 2014.
net cash used in financing activities decreased $165 million in 2016 versus 2015, primarily due to higher proceeds from debt, partially offset by higher dividends paid. net cash used in financing activities increased $119 million in 2015 versus 2014, primarily due to higher dividends paid and an increase in purchases of treasury stock in 2015, partially offset by increased proceeds from debt in 2015.
the table below shows a summary of select balance sheet data at december 31:
balance sheet data:
current assets            $13,228             $10,984
current liabilities         7,206               6,269
long-term liabilities       5,785               3,919
equity                      5,684               6,062
the company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents and investment securities balances, its cash flow generating capabilities, its borrowing capacity and its access to capital resources are sufficient to satisfy its future operating cash needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations and potential obligations.
debt and credit availability in november 2016, the company issued $650 million aggregate principal amount of notes due 2021, $750 million aggregate principal amount of notes due 2026 and $600 million aggregate principal amount of notes due 2046 (collectively the "2016 usd notes"). including the 2016 usd notes, our total debt outstanding as of december 31, 2016 was $5,239 million (collectively the "notes"). the company is not subject to any financial covenants under the notes. the notes are senior unsecured obligations and would rank equally with any future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. the proceeds of the notes are being used for general corporate purposes.
the company has established a commercial paper program (the "commercial paper program"), under which the company is authorized to issue up to $3.75 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. in conjunction with the commercial paper program, the company has entered into a committed unsecured $3.75 billion revolving credit facility (the "credit facility") which expires in october 2021.
borrowings under the commercial paper program and the credit facility are to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes, including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by the company's customers. in addition, the company may borrow and repay amounts under these facilities for business continuity purposes. mastercard had no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program or the credit facility at december 31, 2016 and 2015.
see note 12 (debt) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 for further discussion on the notes, the commercial paper program and the credit facility.
in june 2015, the company filed a universal shelf registration statement to provide additional access to capital, if needed. pursuant to the shelf registration statement, the company may from time to time offer to sell debt securities, preferred stock, class a common stock, depository shares, purchase contracts, units or warrants in one or more offerings.
dividends and share repurchases mastercard has historically paid quarterly dividends on its outstanding class a common stock and class b common stock. subject to legally available funds, we intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend. however, the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, available cash and current and anticipated cash needs. the following table summarizes the annual, per share dividends paid in the years reflected:
(in millions, except per share data)
shares in the company's common stock that are repurchased are considered treasury stock. the timing and actual number of additional shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the operating needs of the business, legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions. in december 2016, the company's board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the company to repurchase up to $4 billion of its class a common stock. this program will become effective after completion of the share repurchase program authorized in december 2015.
the following table summarizes the company's share repurchase authorizations of its class a common stock through december 31, 2016, as well as historical purchases:
(in millions, except average price data)
dollar-value of shares repurchased in 2016     $-                             $3,004                      $507                  $3,511
see note 13 (stockholders' equity) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 for further discussion.
off-balance sheet arrangements mastercard has no off-balance sheet debt, other than lease arrangements and other commitments as presented in the future obligations table that follows.
future obligations the following table summarizes our obligations as of december 31, 2016 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods. we believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our cash balances.
capital leases                               7                   5                     2                      -                           -
employee benefits 3                        200                  62                    34                     20                          84
1 the table does not include the $722 million provision as of december 31, 2016 related to litigation in the u.s. and the u.k. since the payments are not fixed and determinable. see note 18 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 for further discussion.
2 included in the payments due in 2017 is £700 million (approximately $860 million as of december 31, 2016) related to a definitive agreement for the company to acquire a controlling interest in vocalink holdings limited ("vocalink"). see note 2 (acquisitions) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 for further discussion. additional amounts primarily relate to sponsorships to promote the mastercard brand. future cash payments that will become due to our customers under agreements which provide pricing rebates on our standard fees and other incentives in exchange for transaction volumes are not included in the table because the amounts due are contingent on future performance. we have accrued $2.7 billion as of december 31, 2016 related to customer and merchant agreements.
3 amounts relate to severance liabilities along with expected funding requirements for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans.
4 the company has recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $169 million at december 31, 2016. within the next twelve months, the company believes that the resolution of certain federal, foreign and state and local examinations are reasonably possible and that a change in estimate, reducing unrecognized tax benefits, may occur. it is not possible to provide a range of the potential change until the examinations progress further or the related statute of limitations expire. these amounts have been excluded from the table since the settlement period of this liability cannot be reasonably estimated. the timing of these payments will ultimately depend on the progress of tax examinations with the various authorities.
seasonality the company does not experience meaningful seasonality. no individual quarter in 2016, 2015 or 2014 accounted for more than 30% of net revenue.
critical accounting estimates the application of u.s. gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect the company's reported financial condition. we have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period. the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that the company considers to be the most critical to its financial statements. an accounting estimate is considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the company's financial condition. senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of the company's board of directors. the company's significant accounting policies, including recent accounting pronouncements, are described in note 1 (summary of significant accounting policies) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8.
revenue recognition application of the various accounting principles in u.s. gaap related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires the company to make judgments and estimates.  specifically, complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. domestic assessment revenue requires an estimate of our customers' performance in order to recognize this revenue. rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue based on these estimates. we consider various factors in estimating customer performance, including a review of specific transactions, historical experience with that customer and market and economic conditions. differences between actual results and the company's estimates are adjusted in the period the customer reports actual performance. if our customers' actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, net revenue may be materially different.
loss contingencies the company is currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. the company regularly reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses its potential financial exposure. if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. as additional information becomes available, the company reassesses the potential liability related to its pending claims and litigation and may revise its estimates. due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes. see note 18 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 for further discussion.
income taxes in calculating our effective income tax rate, we need to make estimates regarding the timing and amount of taxable and deductible items which will adjust the pretax income earned in various tax jurisdictions. through our interpretation of local tax regulations, adjustments to pretax income for income earned in various tax jurisdictions are reflected within various tax filings. although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may be materially different than the estimated amounts.
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. significant judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance. we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. if it is determined that we are able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of the net carrying value or to the extent we are unable to realize a deferred tax asset, we would adjust the valuation allowance in the period in which such a determination is made, with a corresponding increase or decrease to earnings.
we record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, which may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. we consider all relevant facts and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether any benefit resulting from an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and, if so, how current law impacts the amount reflected within these financial statements. if upon examination, we realize a tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained, this would decrease or increase earnings in the period. in certain situations, the company will have offsetting tax credits or taxes in other jurisdictions.
we do not record u.s. income tax expense for foreign earnings which we intend to reinvest indefinitely to expand our international operations. we consider business plans, planning opportunities, and expected future outcomes in assessing the needs for future expansion and support of our international operations. if our business plans change or our future outcomes differ from our expectations, u.s. income tax expense and our effective tax rate could increase or decrease in that period.
valuation of assets the valuation of assets acquired in a business combination and asset impairment reviews require the use of significant estimates and assumptions. the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the company to estimate the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price consideration. impairment testing for assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required, an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets.
we evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. the impairment evaluation utilizes a quantitative assessment using a two-step impairment test. the first step is to compare the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill, to the fair value. the company uses its market capitalization for estimating the fair value of its reporting unit. if the fair value exceeds the carrying value, then no potential impairment is considered to exist. if the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the second step is performed to determine if the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit. an impairment charge would be recorded if the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value.
the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a qualitative assessment to evaluate all relevant events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets.  in performing the qualitative assessment, we consider relevant events and conditions, including but not limited to, macroeconomic trends, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, cost factors, company-specific events, and legal and regulatory factors. if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than their carrying amounts, the company must perform a quantitative impairment test.
the company's estimates in the valuation of these assets are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. these valuations require the use of management's assumptions, which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur.

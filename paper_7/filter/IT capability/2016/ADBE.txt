item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.
acquisitions during fiscal 2015, we completed our acquisition of privately held fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, images, graphics and hd videos, for $807.5 million. during fiscal 2015, we integrated fotolia into our digital media reportable segment.
we also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. pro forma information has not been presented for any of our fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 acquisitions as the impact to our consolidated financial statements was not material.
subsequent to december 2, 2016, we completed our acquisition of tubemogul, a publicly held video advertising platform company, for approximately $549 million in cash consideration, as well as the assumption of certain employee equity awards. the initial purchase accounting for this transaction has not yet been completed given the short period of time between the acquisition date and the issuance of these financial statements. tubemogul will be integrated into our digital marketing reportable segment for financial reporting purposes in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
see note 2 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these acquisitions.
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the sec, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. we base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. on a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. we also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors.
we believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business combinations, goodwill impairment and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. these areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.
revenue recognition our revenue is derived from the subscription, non-software related hosted services, perpetual and term-based licensing of software products, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training and technical support. most of our enterprise customer arrangements are complex, involving multiple solutions and various license rights, bundled with post-contract customer support and other meaningful rights that together provide a complete end-to-end solution to the customer. throughout the contract period, customers use our solutions to complete various phases of the creative and/or marketing processes allowing them to concurrently work on multiple projects. in response to evolving customer and market expectations, we frequently expand and improve our technology to keep up with the pace of change, to provide enhancements to our tools to meet industry needs and to provide support at each stage of the customer's life cycle.
we recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report.
we enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, maintenance and support, hosted services and consulting.
for our software and software-related multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor-specific objective evidence ("vsoe"); and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements. vsoe of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the undelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements. absent vsoe, revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which vsoe of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered. however, if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.
we determine vsoe for each element based on historical stand-alone sales to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the elements contained in the initial arrangement. in determining vsoe, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range.
we have established vsoe for our software maintenance and support services, custom software development services, consulting services and training, when such services are sold optionally with software licenses.
for multiple-element arrangements containing our non-software services, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of vsoe of selling price, third-party evidence ("tpe") of selling price or best-estimated selling price ("besp"), as applicable; and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method.
for multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to software or software-related elements as a group and any non-software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy. we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vsoe of selling price, if it exists, or tpe of selling price. if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exist for a deliverable, we use besp. once revenue is allocated to software or software-related elements as a group, we recognize revenue in conformance with software revenue accounting guidance. revenue is recognized when revenue recognition criteria are met for each element.
we are generally unable to establish vsoe or tpe for non-software elements and as such, we use besp. besp is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, major product groupings, geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. pricing practices taken into consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. we must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. accordingly, our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.
product revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met. we reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future returns, rebates and price protection at the time the related revenue is recorded. in determining our estimate for returns and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. product returns may be more or less than what was estimated. the amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. our estimate of the rate of sell-through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus impacting our financial position and results of operations.
in the future, actual returns and price protection may exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing products. while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. accordingly, if our estimates change, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which would impact the total net revenue we report.
we recognize revenue for hosted services that are priced based on a committed number of transactions ratably beginning on the date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term. over-usage fees, and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which we capture data, are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred. we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.
our consulting revenue is recognized on a time and materials basis and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable.
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, assumed equity awards, as well as to in-process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets, deferred revenue obligations and equity assumed.
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:
•   future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;
•   expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed;
•   the acquired company's trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company's product portfolio; and in connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed. the estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. the cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. the estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical costs related to fulfilling the obligations.
in connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the equity awards assumed. the estimated fair value is determined utilizing a modified binomial option pricing model which assumes employees exercise their stock options when the share price exceeds the strike price by a certain dollar threshold. if the acquired company has significant historical data on their employee's exercise behavior, then this threshold is determined based upon the acquired company's history. otherwise, our historical exercise experience is used to determine the exercise threshold. zero coupon yields implied by u.s. treasury issuances, implied volatility for our common stock and our historical forfeiture rate are other inputs to the binomial model.
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
goodwill impairment we complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis, during the second quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently, if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist. as part of our annual goodwill impairment test, we first evaluate goodwill to determine if it is more likely than not that the occurrence of an event or change in circumstances has reduced the fair value of a reporting segment below its carrying value. this qualitative assessment requires that we consider events or circumstances that may include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in management or key personnel, changes in strategy and changes in customers.
if the qualitative assessment indicates that the two-step quantitative analysis should be performed, we exercise judgment at various steps, including the identification of reporting segments, assignment of goodwill to reporting segments, and determination of the fair value of each reporting segment. in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill, we typically estimate future revenue, consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows. based on these key assumptions, judgments and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value. assumptions, judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective. they can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. although we believe the assumptions, judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results.
we completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and determined there was no impairment. the results of our annual impairment test indicate that the fair values of our reporting units are significantly in excess of their carrying values.
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. in addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset.
our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. in addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. we expect future examinations to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. we regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from such examinations. we believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, the final determination of any of these examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.
our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.
we are a united states-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple u.s. and foreign tax jurisdictions. a significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our irish subsidiaries. in addition to providing for u.s. income taxes on earnings from the united states, we provide for u.s. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the united states. while we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related u.s. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings.
our income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations. unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in, or our interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. the united states, countries in the european union and other countries where we do business have been considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as adobe. these potential changes could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 1 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements that are of significance, or potential significance to us.
results of operations overview of 2016
for fiscal 2016, we reported strong financial results consistent with the continued execution of our long-term plans for our two strategic growth areas, digital media and digital marketing, while continuing to market and license a broad portfolio of products and solutions.
in our digital media segment, we are a market leader with adobe creative cloud, our subscription-based offering for creating and publishing content and applications. creative cloud delivers value through frequent product updates, storage and access to user files stored in the cloud with syncing of files across users' machines, access to marketplace, social and community-
based features with our adobe stock and behance services, app creation capabilities and affordable point pricing for cost-sensitive customers.
we offer creative cloud for individuals, students, teams and enterprises. these creative cloud offerings address the multiple routes to market we use to license our creative software to targeted customers. adoption of creative cloud has transformed our business model, and we continue to expect this to drive higher long-term revenue growth through an expansion of our customer base by acquiring new users through a lower cost of entry and delivery of additional features and value, as well as keeping existing customers current on our latest release. we have also built out a marketplace for creative cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our adobe stock service. overall, our strategy with creative cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and grow a recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably.
we continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our creative cloud offerings. these strategies include increasing the value creative cloud users receive, such as offering new mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to try out and ultimately subscribe to creative cloud. because of the shift towards creative cloud subscriptions and enterprise term license agreements ("etlas"), revenue from perpetual licensing of our creative products is now immaterial to our business.
we are also a market leader with our adobe document cloud offerings built around our acrobat family of products, the adobe reader and a set of integrated cloud-based document services, including adobe sign. adobe acrobat provides reliable creation and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source type. adobe document cloud, which we believe enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes adobe acrobat dc and adobe sign, and a set of integrated services enables users to create, review, approve, sign and track documents whether on a desktop or mobile device. adobe acrobat dc, with a touch-enabled user interface, is offered both through subscription and perpetual licenses.
annualized recurring revenue ("arr") is currently the key performance metric our management uses to assess the health and trajectory of our overall digital media segment. arr should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue as arr is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. we adjust our reported arr on an annual basis to reflect any material exchange rates changes. our reported arr results in fiscal 2016 are based on currency rates set at the start of fiscal 2016 and held constant throughout the year. we calculate arr as follows:
creative arr         annual value of creative cloud subscriptions and services+ annual digital publishing suite contract value + annual creative etla contract value document cloud arr   annual value of document cloud subscriptions and services +annual document cloud etla contract value digital media arr    creative arr+ document cloud arr creative arr exiting fiscal 2016 was $3.54 billion, up from $2.50 billion at the end of fiscal 2015. document cloud arr exiting fiscal 2016 was $475 million, up from $385 million at the end of fiscal 2015. total digital media arr grew to $4.01 billion at the end of fiscal 2016, up from $2.88 billion at the end of fiscal 2015. revaluing our ending arr for fiscal 2016 using currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2017, our digital media arr at the end of fiscal 2016 would be $3.99 billion or approximately $27 million lower than the arr reported above.
our success in driving growth in arr has positively affected our revenue growth. creative revenue in fiscal 2016 was $3.18 billion, up from $2.30 billion in fiscal 2015 and representing 38% year-over-year growth. document cloud revenue in fiscal 2016 was $764.9 million, slightly down from $792.3 million in fiscal 2015 as we continue to transition document cloud to a subscription-based model. total digital media segment revenue grew to $3.94 billion in fiscal 2016, up from $3.10 billion in fiscal 2015 and representing 27% year-over-year growth.
we are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our digital marketing segment. our digital marketing business provides comprehensive solutions that include analytics, social marketing, targeting, media optimization, digital experience management, cross-channel campaign management, audience management, premium video delivery and monetization. we deliver these capabilities through our adobe marketing cloud, an integrated offering enabling marketers to measure, personalize and optimize marketing campaigns and digital experiences across channels for optimal marketing performance. with its broad set of solutions, including adobe analytics, adobe target, adobe social, adobe media optimizer, adobe experience manager, adobe campaign, adobe audience manager and adobe primetime, as well as real-time dashboards and a collaborative interface, customers of adobe marketing cloud are able to combine data, insights and digital content to deliver a personalized, relevant experience to their constituents.
in addition to chief marketing officers and digital marketers, users of our adobe marketing cloud solutions include marketing professionals such as search engine marketers, media managers, media buyers and marketing research analysts. customers also include web content editors, web analysts and web marketing managers. these customers often are involved in workflows that utilize other adobe products, such as our digital media offerings and our video workflow and delivery technologies. by combining the creativity of our digital media business with the science of our digital marketing business, we help our customers to more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.
we utilize a direct salesforce to market and license our adobe marketing cloud solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem of partners including marketing agencies, systems integrators and developers that help license and deploy our solutions to their customers. we have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments. in fiscal 2016, we achieved record marketing cloud revenue of $1.63 billion, which represents 20% year-over-year revenue growth. in december 2016, we acquired tubemogul and we will integrate tubemogul in our digital marketing business in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. we expect that the addition of tubemogul and sustained demand across our portfolio of marketing cloud solutions will drive revenue growth in future years.
financial performance summary for fiscal 2016
•   total digital media arr of approximately $4.01 billion as of december 2, 2016 increased by $1.13 billion, or 39%, from $2.88 billion as of november 27, 2015. the change in our digital media arr was primarily due to increases in the number of paid creative cloud and document cloud subscriptions, and continued adoption of our etlas.
•   creative revenue of $3.18 billion increased by $873.2 million, or 38%, during fiscal 2016, from $2.30 billion in fiscal 2015. the increase was primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue associated with our creative cloud offerings, and to a lesser extent, increases in revenue associated with our creative cloud photography plan subscription offering.
•   adobe marketing cloud revenue of $1.63 billion increased by $272.7 million, or 20%, during fiscal 2016, from $1.36 billion in fiscal 2015. the increase was primarily due to continued adoption of our adobe experience manager ("aem") offering and increases in adobe analytics and adobe campaign revenue.

fiscal 2016 revenue compared to fiscal 2015 revenue digital media revenue from digital media increased $845.8 million during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily driven by increases in revenue associated with our creative offerings.
revenue associated with our creative offerings, which includes our creative cloud, perpetual creative and stock photography offerings, increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue associated with our creative cloud offerings driven by increases in the number of paid creative cloud individual and team subscriptions, and continued adoption of our etlas. to a lesser extent, increases in revenue associated with our creative cloud photography plan subscription offering and stock photography offerings also contributed to the increase in revenue associated with our creative offerings. increases associated with our creative offerings were slightly offset by expected declines in revenue associated with our perpetual creative offerings and distribution of third-party software downloads.
document cloud revenue, which includes our acrobat product family, decreased slightly during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to expected decreases in revenue associated with our acrobat perpetual license offering. decreases were partially offset by increases in revenue associated with our document cloud subscription offerings as we continue to migrate more customers to our document cloud, along with increases in adobe sign revenue.
digital marketing revenue from digital marketing increased $227.7 million during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to continued revenue growth associated with our adobe marketing cloud, which increased 20% year over year. increases in adobe marketing cloud revenue were largely driven by the continued adoption of our aem offerings and, to a lesser extent, increases in revenue associated with adobe analytics and adobe campaign.
fiscal 2015 revenue compared to fiscal 2014 revenue digital media revenue from digital media increased $492.0 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily driven by increases in revenue associated with our creative offerings due to the strong adoption of creative cloud. document cloud revenue remained stable during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.
creative revenue, which includes our creative cloud and perpetual creative offerings, increased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue associated with our creative cloud offerings driven by the increase in the number of paid creative cloud team, individual and enterprise subscriptions. increases associated with our creative products were offset in part by expected declines in revenue associated with our perpetual creative offerings.
document cloud revenue, which includes our acrobat product family, remained stable during fiscal 2015 as compared to the year ago period, as increases in revenue associated with adobe sign and our document cloud subscription offerings were offset by decreases in revenue associated with our acrobat perpetual license offerings. driving the increase in our document cloud subscription revenue was the adoption of our cloud offering through subscriptions and etlas.
digital marketing revenue from digital marketing increased $153.7 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to continued revenue growth associated with our adobe marketing cloud, which increased 16% as compared to fiscal 2014. contributing to this increase was the continued adoption of our aem term-based offering, and to a lesser extent, increases in revenue associated with adobe campaign, adobe analytics and adobe target.

included in the overall change in revenue for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 were impacts associated with foreign currency as shown below. our currency hedging program is used to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency impact to revenue.
british pound              (36.2    )            (16.1    )
during fiscal 2016, the u.s. dollar strengthened against the euro and british pound which negatively impacted revenue in emea measured in u.s. dollar equivalents. this impact was partially offset by hedging gains from our emea currencies hedging programs during fiscal 2016. during fiscal 2016, the u.s. dollar weakened against the japanese yen, the impact of which was offset by the impact of the u.s. dollar strengthening against other asian currencies.
during fiscal 2015, the u.s. dollar strengthened against the euro, british pound, japanese yen and other asian currencies which negatively impacted revenue in emea and apac measured in u.s. dollar equivalents. this impact was partially offset by hedging gains from our emea currencies and japanese yen hedging programs during fiscal 2015.

backlog deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet consists of billings and payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our products and solutions and does not represent the total contract value of existing annual or multi-year, non-cancelable commercial subscription, saas and managed services agreements or government contracts with fiscal funding clauses. unbilled deferred revenue represents expected future billings which are contractually committed under our existing subscription, saas and managed services agreements that have not been invoiced and are not recorded in deferred revenue within our financial statements. our presentation of unbilled deferred revenue backlog may differ from that of other companies in the industry. as of december 2, 2016, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $3.4 billion of which approximately 40% to 50% is not reasonably expected to be billed during fiscal 2017. comparatively, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $2.9 billion as of november 27, 2015, of which approximately 40% to 50% was not reasonably expected to be billed during fiscal 2016.
we expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue backlog will change from period to period due to certain factors, including the timing and duration of large customer subscriptions, saas and managed service agreements, varying billing cycles of these agreements, the timing of customer renewals, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue backlog is to be billed, changes in customer financial circumstances and foreign currency fluctuations. additionally, the unbilled deferred revenue backlog for multi-year subscription agreements that are billed annually is typically higher at the beginning of the contract period, lower prior to renewal and typically increases when the agreement is renewed. accordingly, fluctuations in unbilled deferred revenue backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future business prospects and the related revenue associated with these contractual commitments.

data center costs increased during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the continued increase in transaction volumes in our adobe marketing cloud and creative cloud services. increases in data center costs were partially offset by decreases in amortization of purchased intangibles driven by the decrease in amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased through our acquisitions of omniture and efficient frontier that became fully amortized in the latter part of fiscal 2015.
data center costs increased during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to higher transaction volumes in our adobe marketing cloud and creative cloud services. depreciation expense increased primarily due to higher capital expenditures as we invested in our network and data center infrastructure to support the growth of our subscription and hosted services business. royalty costs increased primarily due to increases in subscriptions and downloads of our saas offerings and increased royalties due to the introduction of our stock photography offering. amortization of purchased intangibles increased primarily due to amortization of intangibles acquired from our acquisition of fotolia in fiscal 2015.
product cost of product revenue includes product packaging, third-party royalties, excess and obsolete inventory, amortization related to localization costs, purchased intangibles and acquired rights to use technology and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products.

as a result of redirecting our focus and development efforts towards our creative cloud and other subscription offerings, amortization of purchased intangibles and localization costs decreased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in royalty payments related to our stock photography perpetual offering.
cost of product revenue decreased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to decreases in excess and obsolete inventory, cost of sales and amortization of purchased intangibles, partially offset by an increase in royalty cost. the increase in royalty cost was driven by royalty payments related to our stock photography perpetual offering from our acquisition of fotolia in fiscal 2015.

compensation costs increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to headcount, which resulted from decreased usage of outside consultants to provide consulting and training services to customers.
professional and consulting fees increased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to increases in third-party fees related to consulting and training services provided to our customers.

research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses the increase in research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the increase in costs associated with compensation and related benefits driven by increased headcount.
research and development and sales and marketing expenses increased slightly during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to increases in compensation and related benefits associated with headcount. general and administrative expenses decreased slightly during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the reversal of a previously anticipated loss associated with certain legal proceedings, offset in part by increases in compensation and related benefits associated with headcount.

the decrease in loss contingency during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 is due to the reversal of a previously anticipated loss associated with certain legal proceedings.
amortization of purchased intangibles during the last several years, we have completed a number of business combinations and asset acquisitions. as a result of these acquisitions, we purchased intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to fourteen years.
amortization expense increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to write-off of certain acquired intangible assets from a previous acquisition and the increase in amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased in fiscal 2016.
amortization expense increased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of fotolia in fiscal 2015, partially offset by the decrease in amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of efficient frontier and day software holding ag that were fully amortized at the end of fiscal 2014.

interest and other income (expense), net decreased in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 due to the gain on the sale of certain property assets that occurred in fiscal 2015 and the increase in foreign exchange hedging costs, offset by the increase in interest income due to increased average investment balance and interest rates.
interest and other income (expense), net increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the gain on the sale of certain property assets and, to a lesser extent, an increased average investment balance and average interest rate. see note 6 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further details regarding the sale of our property assets.
interest expense interest expense primarily represents interest associated with our senior notes and interest rate swaps. interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on february 1 and august 1. floating interest payments on the interest rate swaps are paid monthly. the fixed-rate interest receivable on the swaps is received semi-annually concurrent with the senior notes interest payments.  see notes 5 and 15 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our interest rate swaps.

our effective tax rate decreased by approximately nine percentage points during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. the decrease was primarily due to tax benefits recognized as a result of the completion of certain income tax examinations and the permanent extension of the u.s. research and development credit for 2015 and onward. the reinstatement of the credit was retroactive to january 1, 2015. a tax benefit for the credit relating to fiscal 2015 was reflected in its entirety in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. the decrease was partially offset by stronger domestic profits for fiscal 2016. in addition, the fiscal 2015 effective tax rate included one-time tax costs associated with licensing acquired company assets to adobe's trading companies, offset by tax benefits for the temporary reinstatement of the u.s. research and development credit in december 2014.
our effective tax rate increased by approximately two percentage points during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. the increase was primarily due to tax costs associated with licensing acquired company assets to adobe's trading companies. the increase was partially offset by tax benefits related to the reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit in december 2014. the reinstatement of the credit was retroactive to january 1, 2014.
we are a united states-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple u.s. and foreign tax jurisdictions. a significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year was earned by our irish subsidiaries. in addition to providing for u.s. income taxes on earnings from the united states, we provide for u.s. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the united states. while we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related u.s. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. currently, there is a significant amount of foreign earnings upon which u.s. income taxes have not been provided. see note 9 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our provision for income taxes.
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at december 2, 2016 was $178.4 million, exclusive of interest and penalties. if the total unrecognized tax benefits at december 2, 2016 were recognized in the future, $144.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits would decrease the effective tax rate, which is net of an estimated $33.9 million federal benefit related to deducting certain payments on future federal and state tax returns.
as of december 2, 2016, the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns was approximately $22.4 million. this amount is included in non-current income taxes payable.
the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. these events could cause large fluctuations in the balance of current and non-current assets, liabilities and income taxes payable. we believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $10 million.
during fiscal 2016, a number of income tax examinations covering our fiscal years 2010 to 2016 were completed. of the significant examinations, accrued tax and interest related to these years were $95.6 million and were previously reported in non-current income taxes payable. we settled the tax obligation resulting from these examinations with cash and income tax assets totaling $35.3 million, and the resulting $60.3 million income tax benefit was recorded in fiscal 2016.

our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. the primary uses of cash are payroll related expenses, general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of revenue. other sources of cash are proceeds from participation in the employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of employee options. other uses of cash include our stock repurchase program, which is described below, business acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment.
cash flows from operating activities for fiscal 2016, net cash provided by operating activities of $2.20 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. the primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses. the increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions for our creative cloud offerings and increases in digital marketing hosted services. the increase in accrued expenses is primarily due to the increase in accruals for compensation costs and employee benefits driven by the increase in headcount. the primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a decrease in income taxes payable. trade receivables increased primarily due to higher revenue levels. prepaid expenses and other current assets increased primarily due to advanced tax payments made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. income taxes payable decreased primarily due to the completion of certain income tax audits in fiscal 2016, offset in part by increases to the tax provision in excess of taxes paid.
for fiscal 2015, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.47 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. the primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue, income taxes payable and trade payables. the increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions for our team, individual and enterprise creative cloud offerings and increases in digital marketing hosted services. the increase in income taxes payable was primarily due to higher taxable income levels during fiscal 2015. trade payables increased primarily due to the timing of payments to web services vendors as certain invoices were received in the final weeks of fiscal 2015. the primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables which were principally due to higher revenue levels.
for fiscal 2014, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.29 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. the primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses. the increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscription and etla activity for our individual, team and enterprise creative cloud offerings and increases in digital marketing and digital publishing hosted services, offset in part by decreases in billings for our maintenance and creative product software upgrade plans which we discontinued in january 2013. accrued expenses increased primarily due to accruals for contract terminations and employee transition payments associated with business realignment initiatives implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.
cash flows from investing activities for fiscal 2016, net cash used for investing activities of $960.0 million was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments. other uses of cash represented purchases of property and equipment, purchases of long-term investments and other assets, and an immaterial acquisition. these cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments.
for fiscal 2015, net cash used for investing activities of $1.49 billion was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments and our acquisition of fotolia. other uses of cash during fiscal 2015 represented purchases of property and equipment, and long-term investments and other assets. these cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments and proceeds received from the sale of certain property assets. see note 2 and note 6 of our consolidated financial statements for more detailed information regarding our acquisition of fotolia and sale of property assets, respectively.
for fiscal 2014, net cash used for investing activities of $490.7 million was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments, purchases of property and equipment and a business acquisition. these cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments.
cash flows from financing activities for fiscal 2016, net cash used for financing activities of $1.09 billion was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
in january 2015, we issued $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due february 1, 2025 (the "2025 notes"). our proceeds were approximately $989.3 million which is net of an issuance discount of $10.7 million. in addition, we incurred issuance costs of $7.9 million. both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2025 notes using the effective interest method. the 2025 notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
we used $600 million of the proceeds from the 2025 notes offering to repay the outstanding balance plus accrued and unpaid interest of the $600 million 3.25% senior notes due february 1, 2015 ("2015 notes"). the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.  see note 15 of our consolidated financial statements for more detailed information.
in addition to the 2025 notes issuance and 2015 notes repayment, other financing activities during fiscal 2015 also include payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
for fiscal 2014, net cash used for financing activities of $507.3 million was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
see the section titled "stock repurchase program" discussed below.
we expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, venture capital, facilities expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff. furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business.
other liquidity and capital resources considerations our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2017 due to changes in our planned cash outlay, including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to our acquisitions. our cash and investments totaled $4.76 billion as of december 2, 2016. of this amount, approximately 83% was held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to material repatriation tax effects. our intent is to permanently reinvest a significant portion of our earnings from foreign operations, and current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. in the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the united states and if u.s. tax has not already been previously provided, we would provide for and pay additional u.s. taxes in connection with repatriating these funds.
cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in part i, item 1a titled "risk factors." however, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.
on march 2, 2012, we entered into a five-year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the "credit agreement"), providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries. on march 1, 2013, we exercised our option under the credit agreement to extend the maturity date of the credit agreement by one year to march 2, 2018. on july 27, 2015, we entered into an amendment to further extend the maturity date of the credit agreement to july 27, 2020 and reallocated the facility among the syndicate of lenders that are parties to the credit agreement. as of december 2, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit agreement and the entire $1 billion credit line remains available for borrowing.
as of december 2, 2016, the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.9 billion, consisting of $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due february 1, 2020 (the "2020 notes") and $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due february 1, 2025 (together with the 2020 notes, the "notes").
subsequent to december 2, 2016, we completed our acquisition of tubemogul, a publicly held video advertising platform company, for approximately $549 million in cash consideration, as well as the assumption of certain employee equity awards. see note 2 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this acquisition.
our short-term investment portfolio is primarily invested in corporate bonds and commercial paper, u.s. agency securities and u.s. treasury securities, foreign government securities, municipal securities and asset-backed securities.we use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash. external investment firms managed, on average, 61% of our consolidated invested balances during fiscal 2016.
stock repurchase program to facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, the board of directors approved our stock repurchase program granting us authority to repurchase up to $2 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2017.
during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $1.08 billion, $625 million and $600 million, respectively. the prepayments of $1.08 billion made during fiscal 2016 were under the current $2 billion authority. of the prepayments of $625 million made during fiscal 2015, $425 million were under the current $2 billion authority and $200 million were under the previous $2 billion authority. the prepayments of $600 million made during fiscal 2014 were under the previous $2 billion authority. we enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the volume weighted average price ("vwap") of our common stock over a specified period of time. we only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than the expected foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. there were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.
the financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. the parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average vwap of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. during fiscal 2016, we repurchased approximately 10.4 million shares at an average price of $97.16 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. during fiscal 2015, we repurchased approximately 8.1 million shares at an average price of $77.38 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. during fiscal 2014, we repurchased approximately 10.9 million shares at an average price per share of $63.48 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013.
for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by december 2, 2016, november 27, 2015 and november 28, 2014 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. as of december 2, 2016, $100.1 million of prepayments remained under the agreement.
subsequent to december 2, 2016, as part of our current $2 billion stock repurchase program, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $200 million. this amount will be classified as treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets. upon completion of the $200 million stock repurchase agreement, $300 million remains under our current authority.
subsequent to december 2, 2016, the board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program granting us authority to repurchase up to $2.5 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2019. the new stock repurchase program approved by our board of directors is similar to our previous stock repurchase programs.
see item 5, market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for share repurchases during the quarter ended december 2, 2016.
summary of stock repurchases for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014
(1)   stock repurchase agreements executed with large financial institutions. see stock repurchase program above.
off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations our principal commitments as of december 2, 2016 consist of obligations under operating leases, royalty agreements and various service agreements. see note 14 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our contractual commitments.
senior notes as of december 2, 2016, our outstanding notes payable consists of the 2020 notes and 2025 notes with a total carrying value of $1.90 billion. interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears on february 1 and august 1. at december 2, 2016, our maximum commitment for interest payments under the notes was $425.9 million for the remaining duration of our notes. in june 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 notes to a floating interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate ("libor") plus a fixed number of basis points through february 1, 2020.
covenants our credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. our almaden tower lease includes certain financial ratios as defined in the lease agreement that are reported to the lessor quarterly. as of december 2, 2016, we were in compliance with all of our covenants. we believe these covenants will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. our notes do not contain any financial covenants.
under the terms of our credit agreement and lease agreements, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists. we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at december 2, 2016 was $178.4 million, exclusive of interest and penalties.
the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. these events could cause large fluctuations in the balance of current and non-current assets, liabilities and income taxes payable. we believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $10 million.
royalties we have certain royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain products. royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit, or a percentage of the underlying revenue.
indemnifications in the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.
to the extent permitted under delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity. the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director's or officer's lifetime. the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.

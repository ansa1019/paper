item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the objectives of our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") are to provide users of our consolidated financial statements with the following:
•a narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results;
•context to the consolidated financial statements; and
•information that allows assessment of the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance.
our md&a is provided as a supplement to, and should be read together with, our audited consolidated financial statements as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, and for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2022, included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k. except as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout our md&a are those of t-mobile us, inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
sprint merger, network integration and decommissioning activities transaction overview on april 1, 2020, we completed the merger with sprint, a communications company offering a comprehensive range of wireless and wireline communications products and services. as a result, sprint and its subsidiaries became wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries of t-mobile.
the merger has altered the size and scope of our operations, impacting our assets, liabilities, obligations, capital requirements and performance measures. as a combined company, we have been able to enhance the breadth and depth of our nationwide 5g network, accelerate innovation, increase competition in the u.s. wireless and broadband industries and achieve significant synergies and cost reductions by eliminating redundancies within the combined network as well as other business processes and operations.
for more information regarding our business combination agreement, see note 2 - business combinations of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
merger-related costs merger-related costs associated with the merger and acquisitions of affiliates generally include:
•integration costs to achieve efficiencies in network, retail, information technology and back office operations, migrate customers to the t-mobile network and billing systems and the impact of legal matters assumed as part of the merger;
•restructuring costs, including severance, store rationalization and network decommissioning; and
•transaction costs, including legal and professional services related to the completion of the transactions.
restructuring costs are disclosed in note 20 - restructuring costs of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. merger-related costs have been excluded from our calculations of adjusted ebitda and core adjusted ebitda, which are non-gaap financial measures, as we do not consider these costs to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance. see "adjusted ebitda and core adjusted ebitda" in the "performance measures" section of this md&a. net cash payments for merger-related costs, including payments related to our restructuring plan, are included in net cash provided by operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows.
merger-related costs are presented below:

nm - not meaningful we expect to incur substantially all of the remaining projected merger-related costs of approximately $1.0 billion, excluding capital expenditures, by the end of 2023, with the cash expenditure for the merger-related costs extending beyond 2023.
we are evaluating additional restructuring initiatives which are dependent on consultations and negotiation with certain counterparties and the expected impact on our business operations, which could affect the amount or timing of the restructuring costs and related payments. we expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements and anticipated payments associated with the restructuring initiatives.
network integration as of december 31, 2022, we have decommissioned substantially all sprint macro sites targeted for shut down. our integration and decommissioning initiatives also included the acceleration or termination of certain of our operating and financing leases for cell sites, switch sites and network equipment. to achieve merger synergies in network costs, we continue to perform rationalization activities to identify duplicative networks, backhaul services and other agreements, in addition to decommissioning certain small cell sites and distributed antenna systems.
to allow for the realization of these synergies associated with network integration, we retired certain legacy networks, including the legacy sprint cdma network in the second quarter and the legacy sprint lte network in the third quarter of 2022. customers impacted by the decommissioning of these networks have been excluded from our customer base and postpaid account base. see the "performance measures" section of this md&a for more details.
restructuring upon the close of the merger, we began implementing restructuring initiatives to realize cost efficiencies from the merger. the major activities associated with the restructuring initiatives to date include:
•contract termination costs associated with rationalization of retail stores, distribution channels, duplicative network and backhaul services and other agreements;
•severance costs associated with the reduction of redundant processes and functions; and
•the decommissioning of certain small cell sites and distributed antenna systems to achieve merger synergies in network costs.
for more information regarding our restructuring activities, see note 20 - restructuring costs of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
anticipated merger synergies as a result of our ongoing restructuring and integration activities, we expect to realize merger synergies by eliminating redundancies within our combined network (see "network integration" above) as well as other business processes and operations (see "restructuring" above). for full-year 2023, we expect merger synergies from selling, general and administrative expense reductions of $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion, cost of service expense reductions of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion and avoided network expenses of $1.6 billion.
wireline previously, the operation of the legacy sprint cdma and lte wireless networks was supported by the legacy sprint wireline network. during the second quarter of 2022, we retired the legacy sprint cdma network and began the orderly shut-down of the lte network, which was completed during the third quarter. as a result of these actions during the second quarter of 2022, we determined that the retirement of the legacy sprint cdma and lte wireless networks triggered the need to assess the wireline long-lived assets for impairment, as these assets no longer support our wireless network and the associated customers and cash flows in a significant manner. the results of this assessment indicated that certain wireline long-lived assets were impaired, and as a result, we recorded non-cash impairment expense of $477 million related to wireline property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and other intangible assets for the year ended december 31, 2022, all of which relates to the impairment recognized during the three months ended june 30, 2022. we continue to provide wireline services to existing wireline customers as of december 31, 2022.
for more information regarding this non-cash impairment, see note 16 - wireline of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
on september 6, 2022, we entered into the wireline sale agreement to sell the wireline business for a total purchase price of $1. in addition, at the consummation of the wireline transaction, we will enter into an agreement for ip transit services for $700 million. subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions and the other terms and conditions of the wireline sale agreement, the wireline transaction is expected to close mid-year 2023. as a result of the wireline sale agreement and related anticipated wireline transaction, we concluded that the wireline business met the held for sale criteria upon entering into the wireline sale agreement. as such, the assets and liabilities of the wireline business disposal group are classified as held for sale and presented within other current assets and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2022. in connection with the expected sale of the wireline business and classification of related assets and liabilities as held for sale, we recognized a pre-tax loss of $1.1 billion during the year ended december 31, 2022, which is included within loss on disposal group held for sale on our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. the fair value of the wireline business disposal group, less costs to sell, will be reassessed during each subsequent reporting period it remains classified as held for sale, and any remeasurement to the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell will be reported as an adjustment to the loss on disposal group held for sale.
for more information regarding the wireline sale agreement, see note 16 - wireline of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
recent cyberattacks in august 2021, we were subject to a criminal cyberattack involving unauthorized access to t-mobile's systems. as a result of the attack, we are subject to numerous arbitration demands and lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, and regulatory inquiries as described in note 19 - commitments and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
in connection with the proposed class action settlement and the separate settlements reached with a number of consumers, we recorded a total pre-tax charge of approximately $400 million during the three months ended june 30, 2022. we expect to continue to incur additional expenses in future periods, including costs to remediate the attack, resolve inquiries by various government authorities, provide additional customer support and enhance customer protection, only some of which may be covered and reimbursable by insurance. in addition to the committed aggregate incremental spend of $150 million for data security and related technology in 2022 and 2023 under the proposed settlement agreement, we intend to allocate substantial additional resources towards cybersecurity initiatives over the next several years.
during the year ended december 31, 2022, we recognized $100 million in reimbursements from insurance carriers for costs incurred related to the august 2021 cyberattack. we are pursuing additional reimbursements from insurance carriers for costs incurred related to the august 2021 cyberattack.
in january 2023, we disclosed that a bad actor was obtaining data through a single application programming interface ("api") without authorization. based on our investigation to date, the impacted api is only able to provide a limited set of customer account data, including name, billing address, email, phone number, date of birth, t-mobile account number and information such as the number of lines on the account and plan features. the result from our investigation to date indicates that the bad actor(s) obtained data from this api for approximately 37 million current postpaid and prepaid customer accounts, though many of these accounts did not include the full data set. we believe that the bad actor first retrieved data through the impacted api starting on or around november 25, 2022. we continue to investigate the incident and have notified individuals whose information was impacted consistent with state and federal requirements.
we will respond to litigation and regulatory inquiries in connection with this incident and may incur significant expenses. however, we cannot predict the timing or outcome of any of these potential matters, or whether we may be subject to regulatory inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions. in addition, we are unable to predict the full impact of this incident on customer behavior in the future, including whether a change in our customers' behavior could negatively impact our results of operations on an ongoing basis, although we presently do not expect that it will have a material effect on our operations.
additionally, following the august 2021 cyberattack, we commenced a substantial multi-year investment working with leading external cybersecurity experts to enhance our cybersecurity capabilities and transform our approach to cybersecurity. while we have made progress to date, we plan to continue to make substantial investments to strengthen our cybersecurity program in future periods.
revenue trends in 2023, we expect service revenues to continue to grow, primarily due to continued postpaid account and customer growth as well as postpaid average revenue per account ("postpaid arpa") growth driven by the execution of our strategy to continuously deepen our account relationships, including growth in high speed internet. we expect the increase in postpaid service revenues to be partially offset by a decrease in wholesale and other service revenues, primarily driven by the sale of the wireline business, which is expected to close mid-2023, the migration by verizon of legacy tracfone customers off of the t-mobile network and as dish services more of its boost customers with their standalone network. we also expect lower lease revenues as a result of the continued strategic shift in device financing from leasing to eip.
operating expense trends in 2023, we expect total operating expenses to decrease, primarily due to continued synergy realization benefiting cost of services and selling, general and administrative expense as well as a significant decrease in merger-related costs from $5.0 billion in 2022 to approximately $1.0 billion expected in 2023 as the majority of our integration activities have been completed.
we further expect a decrease in operating expenses, primarily cost of services, associated with serving wireline customers driven by the sale of the wireline business which is expected to close mid-2023. the trend of decreasing depreciation on leased devices is expected to continue as a result of the continued strategic shift in device financing from leasing to eip.
macroeconomic trends macroeconomic trends may result in adverse impacts on our business, and we continue to monitor these potential impacts, including potential economic recession, changes in the federal reserve's monetary policy, as well as geopolitical risks, including the war in ukraine. such scenarios and uncertainties may affect, among others, expected credit loss activity as well as certain fair value estimates.
to date, price inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations as we have fixed rates established through long-term contracts for many of our most significant costs, including tower agreements and backhaul contracts. similarly, our exposure to the impact of rising interest rates is limited, primarily to any new debt issuances or draws on our revolving credit facility, as interest is paid on our senior notes at a fixed rate. we continue to monitor the impact of these trends on the payment performance of our customers.
inflation reduction act on august 16, 2022, president biden signed the inflation reduction act of 2022 ("ira") into law. the ira includes several changes to existing tax law, including a minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income of applicable corporations and an excise tax on certain corporate stock buybacks. the tax provisions included in the ira are generally effective beginning january 1, 2023, and had no significant impact to the 2022 consolidated financial statements. management does not expect the ira to have a significant impact on our operating results or cash flows in 2023, and we continue to review the ira tax provisions to assess impacts to our future consolidated financial statements.

total revenues decreased $547 million, or 1%. the components of these changes are discussed below.
•higher postpaid arpa. see "postpaid arpa" in the "performance measures" section of this md&a.
prepaid revenues increased $124 million, or 1%, primarily from higher average prepaid customers.
•a decrease of $1.9 billion in lease revenues and a decrease of $599 million in customer purchases of leased devices primarily due to a lower number of customer devices under lease as a result of the continued strategic shift in device financing from leasing to eip; and
•a decrease in the number of devices sold primarily driven by lower prepaid sales, partially offset by higher upgrade volume for sprint customers to facilitate their migration to the t-mobile network;
•slightly lower average revenue per device sold, primarily driven by higher promotions, which included promotions for sprint customers to facilitate their migration to the t-mobile network; and total operating expenses decreased $198 million. the components of this change are discussed below.
•an increase of $1.7 billion in merger-related costs related to network decommissioning and integration costs; and
•higher site costs related to the continued build-out of our nationwide 5g network; partially offset by
•a decrease of $964 million in customer purchases of leased devices, primarily due to a lower number of customer devices under lease as a result of the continued strategic shift in device financing from leasing to eip; and
•a decrease in the number of devices sold primarily driven by lower prepaid sales, partially offset by higher upgrade volume for sprint customers to facilitate their migration to the t-mobile network; partially offset by
•cost of equipment sales for the year ended december 31, 2022, included $1.5 billion of merger-related costs, primarily to facilitate the migration of sprint customers to the t-mobile network, compared to $1.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021.
•an increase of $773 million in bad debt expense and losses from sales of receivables, driven by higher receivable balances, as well as normalization relative to muted pandemic levels in 2021 and estimated potential future macroeconomic impacts;
•higher legal-related expenses, net of recoveries, including $400 million recognized in june 2022 for the settlement of certain litigation associated with the august 2021 cyberattack, partially offset by $100 million in reimbursements from insurance carriers received in 2022 associated with the august 2021 cyberattack; and
•higher costs related to outsourced functions; partially offset by
•higher realized merger synergies and lower merger-related costs; and
•gains from the sale of certain ip addresses held by the wireline business.
•selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2022, included $775 million of merger-related costs, primarily related to integration, restructuring and legal-related expenses, partially offset by $333 million received in gross settlements for certain patent litigation assumed in the merger, compared to $1.1 billion of merger-related costs for the year ended december 31, 2021.
impairment expense was $477 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, due to the non-cash impairment of certain wireline property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and other intangible assets. see note 16 - wireline of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. there was no impairment expense for the year ended december 31, 2021.

total net customer additions increased 920,000, or 16%, primarily from:
•higher postpaid other net customer additions, primarily due to an increase in postpaid high speed internet net customer additions and other connected devices, partially offset by lower net additions from mobile internet devices; and
•higher postpaid phone net customer additions, primarily due to lower churn, partially offset by lower gross additions driven by industry switching activity normalizing closer to pre-pandemic levels; partially offset by
•lower prepaid net customer additions associated with the continued industry shift to postpaid plans, partially offset by the introduction of our prepaid high speed internet offering and lower churn.
•high speed internet net customer additions included in postpaid other net customer additions were 1,764,000 and 546,000 for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. high speed internet net customer additions included in prepaid net customer additions were 236,000 for the year ended december 31, 2022. our prepaid high speed internet launch was in the first quarter of 2022. therefore, there were no prepaid high speed internet net customer additions for the year ended december 31, 2021.
churn churn represents the number of customers whose service was disconnected as a percentage of the average number of customers during the specified period further divided by the number of months in the period. the number of customers whose service was disconnected is presented net of customers that subsequently had their service restored within a certain period of time and excludes customers who received service for less than a certain minimum period of time. we believe that churn provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate customer retention and loyalty.
the following table sets forth the churn:

postpaid average revenue per account postpaid arpa represents the average monthly postpaid service revenue earned per account. postpaid arpa is calculated as postpaid revenues for the specified period divided by the average number of postpaid accounts during the period, further divided by the number of months in the period. we believe postpaid arpa provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our postpaid service revenue realization and assist in forecasting our future postpaid service revenues on a per account basis. we consider postpaid arpa to be indicative of our revenue growth potential given the increase in the average number of postpaid phone customers per account and increases in postpaid other customers, including high speed internet, tablets, wearables, digits or other connected devices.

average revenue per user average revenue per user ("arpu") represents the average monthly service revenue earned per customer. arpu is calculated as service revenues for the specified period divided by the average number of customers during the period, further divided by the number of months in the period. we believe arpu provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our service revenue per customer and assist in forecasting our future service revenues generated from our customer base. postpaid phone arpu excludes postpaid other customers and related revenues, which include high speed internet, tablets, wearables, digits and other connected devices.

•increased promotional activity; offset by adjusted ebitda and core adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda represents earnings before interest expense, net of interest income, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and certain income and expenses not reflective of our ongoing operating performance. core adjusted ebitda represents adjusted ebitda less device lease revenues. adjusted ebitda margin represents adjusted ebitda divided by service revenues. core adjusted ebitda margin represents core adjusted ebitda divided by service revenues.
adjusted ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin, core adjusted ebitda and core adjusted ebitda margin are non-gaap financial measures utilized by our management to monitor the financial performance of our operations. we historically used adjusted ebitda and we currently use core adjusted ebitda internally as a measure to evaluate and compensate our personnel and management for their performance. we use adjusted ebitda and core adjusted ebitda as benchmarks to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors. management believes analysts and investors use adjusted ebitda and core adjusted ebitda as supplemental measures to evaluate overall operating performance and to facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications services companies because they are indicative of our ongoing operating performance and trends by excluding the impact of interest expense from financing, non-cash depreciation and amortization from capital investments, stock-based compensation, merger-related costs, including network decommissioning costs, impairment expense, losses on disposal groups held for sale and certain legal-related recoveries and expenses, as well as other special income and expenses which are not reflective of our core business activities. management believes analysts and investors use core adjusted ebitda because it normalizes for the transition in the company's device financing strategy, by excluding the impact of device lease revenues from adjusted ebitda, to align with the exclusion of the related depreciation expense on leased devices from adjusted ebitda. adjusted ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin, core adjusted ebitda and core adjusted ebitda margin have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for income from operations, net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap.
the following table illustrates the calculation of adjusted ebitda and core adjusted ebitda and reconciles adjusted ebitda and core adjusted ebitda to net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable gaap financial measure:

adjusted ebitda increased $897 million, or 3%, for the year ended december 31, 2022, primarily due to the fluctuations in core adjusted ebitda, discussed above, partially offset by lower lease revenues, which decreased $1.9 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022.
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, proceeds from issuance of debt, financing leases, the sale of certain receivables and the revolving credit facility (as defined below). further, the incurrence of additional indebtedness may inhibit our ability to incur new debt in the future to finance our business strategy under the terms governing our existing and future indebtedness.

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased $2.9 billion, or 21%, primarily from:
•a $4.1 billion decrease in net cash outflows from changes in working capital, primarily due to lower use of cash from short- and long-term operating lease liabilities, including the impact of a $1.0 billion advance rent payment related to the modification of one of our master lease agreements during the year ended december 31, 2021, eip receivables, other current and long-term liabilities and inventories, partially offset by higher use of cash from accounts receivable; partially offset by
•a $1.2 billion decrease in net income, adjusted for non-cash income and expense.
•net cash provided by operating activities includes the impact of $3.4 billion and $2.2 billion in net payments for merger-related costs for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased $7.0 billion or 36%. the use of cash was primarily from:
•$14.0 billion in purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest, from the accelerated build-out of our nationwide 5g network, including from network integration related to the merger; and
•$3.3 billion in purchases of spectrum licenses and other intangible assets, including deposits, primarily due to $2.8 billion paid for spectrum licenses won at the conclusion of auction 110 in february 2022 and $304 million paid in total for spectrum licenses won at the conclusion of auction 108 in september 2022; partially offset by
•$4.8 billion in proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was $6.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021. the use of cash was primarily from:
•$243 million in tax withholdings on share-based awards; partially offset by free cash flow free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less cash payments for purchases of property and equipment, including proceeds from sales of tower sites and proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions and less cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs. free cash flow is a non-gaap financial measure utilized by management, investors and analysts of our financial information to evaluate cash available to pay debt, repurchase shares and provide further investment in the business.
in 2022 and 2021, we received proceeds from the sale of tower sites of $9 million and $40 million, respectively, which are included in proceeds from sales of tower sites within net cash used in investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows. as these proceeds were from the sale of fixed assets and are used by management to assess cash available for capital expenditures during the year, we determined the proceeds are relevant for the calculation of free cash flow and included them in the table below. other proceeds from the sale of fixed assets for the periods presented are not significant. we have presented the impact of the sales in the table below, which reconciles free cash flow and free cash flow, excluding gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we consider to be the most directly comparable gaap financial measure.

borrowing capacity we maintain a revolving credit facility (the "revolving credit facility") with an aggregate commitment amount of $7.5 billion. as of december 31, 2022, there was no outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility. see note 8 - debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the revolving credit facility.
debt financing as of december 31, 2022, our total debt and financing lease liabilities were $74.5 billion, excluding our tower obligations, of which $66.8 billion was classified as long-term debt and $1.4 billion was classified as long-term financing lease liabilities.
during the year ended december 31, 2022, we issued long-term debt for net proceeds of $3.7 billion and repaid short- and long-term debt with an aggregate principal amount of $5.6 billion.
for more information regarding our debt financing transactions, see note 8 - debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
spectrum auctions in march 2021, the fcc announced that we were the winning bidder of 142 licenses in auction 107 (c-band spectrum) for an aggregate purchase price of $9.3 billion, excluding relocation costs. we expect to incur an additional $767 million in fixed relocation costs, which will be paid through 2024.
in january 2022, the fcc announced that we were the winning bidder of 199 licenses in auction 110 (3.45 ghz spectrum) for an aggregate purchase price of $2.9 billion. at the inception of auction 110 in september 2021, we deposited $100 million. we paid the fcc the remaining $2.8 billion for the licenses won in the auction in february 2022.
in september 2022, the fcc announced that we were the winning bidder of 7,156 licenses in auction 108 (2.5 ghz spectrum) for an aggregate price of $304 million. at the inception of auction 108 in june 2022, we deposited $65 million. we paid the fcc the remaining $239 million for the licenses won in the auction in september 2022. our receipt of these licenses was still awaiting fcc final approval of the auction results as of december 31, 2022.
for more information regarding our spectrum licenses, see note 6 - goodwill, spectrum license transactions and other intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
license purchase agreements on august 8, 2022, we entered into license purchase agreements to acquire spectrum in the 600 mhz band from channel 51 license co llc and lb license co, llc in exchange for total cash consideration of $3.5 billion. the closing of this purchase was still awaiting fcc final approval as of december 31, 2022.
for more information regarding our license purchase agreements, see note 6 - goodwill, spectrum license transactions and other intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have arrangements, as amended from time to time, to sell certain eip accounts receivable and service accounts receivable on a revolving basis as a source of liquidity. as of december 31, 2022, we derecognized net receivables of $2.4 billion upon sale through these arrangements.
for more information regarding these off-balance sheet arrangements, see note 4 - sales of certain receivables of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
future sources and uses of liquidity we may seek additional sources of liquidity, including through the issuance of additional debt, to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses or other long-lived assets in private party transactions, repurchase shares, or for the refinancing of existing long-term debt on an opportunistic basis. excluding liquidity that could be needed for spectrum acquisitions, other long-lived assets or for any potential stockholder returns, we expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for business operations for the next 12 months as well as our longer-term liquidity needs. our intended use of any such funds is for general corporate purposes, including for capital expenditures, spectrum purchases, opportunistic investments and acquisitions, redemption of debt, tower obligations, share repurchases and the execution of our integration plan.
we determine future liquidity requirements for operations, capital expenditures and share repurchases based in large part upon projected financial and operating performance, and opportunities to acquire additional spectrum or repurchase shares. we regularly review and update these projections for changes in current and projected financial and operating results, general economic conditions, the competitive landscape and other factors. we have incurred, and will incur, substantial expenses to comply with the government commitments, and we are also expected to incur substantial restructuring expenses in connection with integrating and coordinating t-mobile's and sprint's businesses, operations, policies and procedures. see "restructuring" in this md&a. while we have assumed that a certain level of merger-related expenses will be incurred, factors beyond our control, including required consultation and negotiation with certain counterparties, could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses. these expenses could exceed the costs historically borne by us and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. there are a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including those due to the impact of the pandemic, that could cause our financial and operating results and capital requirements to differ materially from our projections, which could cause future liquidity to differ materially from our assessment.
the indentures, supplemental indentures and credit agreements governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding financing leases, contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the issuers or borrowers and the guarantor subsidiaries to incur more debt, create liens or other encumbrances, and merge, consolidate or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. we were in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants as of december 31, 2022.
financing lease facilities we have entered into uncommitted financing lease facilities with certain third parties that provide us with the ability to enter into financing leases for network equipment and services. as of december 31, 2022, we have committed to $7.5 billion of financing leases under these financing lease facilities, of which $1.2 billion was executed during the year ended december 31, 2022. we expect to enter into up to an additional $1.2 billion in financing lease commitments during the year ending december 31, 2023.
capital expenditures our liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses, the construction, expansion and upgrading of our network infrastructure and the integration of the networks, spectrum, technology, personnel and customer base of t-mobile and sprint. property and equipment capital expenditures primarily relate to the integration of our network and spectrum licenses, including acquired sprint pcs and 2.5 ghz spectrum licenses, as we build out our nationwide 5g network. we expect a reduction in capital expenditures related to these efforts following 2022. future capital expenditure requirements will include the deployment of our recently acquired c-band and 3.45 ghz spectrum licenses.
for more information regarding our spectrum licenses, see note 6 - goodwill, spectrum license transactions and other intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
stockholder returns we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.
on september 8, 2022, our board of directors authorized our 2022 stock repurchase program for up to $14.0 billion of our common stock through september 30, 2023. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we repurchased shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of $3.0 billion, all of which were purchased under the 2022 stock repurchase program and occurred during the period from september 8, 2022, through december 31, 2022. as of december 31, 2022, we had up to $11.0 billion remaining under the 2022 stock repurchase program.
subsequent to december 31, 2022, from january 1, 2023, through february 10, 2023, we repurchased additional shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of $2.1 billion. as of february 10, 2023, we had up to $8.9 billion remaining under the 2022 stock repurchase program.
for additional information regarding the 2022 stock repurchase program, see note 15 - repurchases of common stock of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
contractual obligations in connection with the regulatory approvals of the transactions, we made commitments to various state and federal agencies, including the u.s. department of justice and fcc.
for more information regarding these commitments, see note 19 - commitments and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
the following table summarizes our material contractual obligations and borrowings as of december 31, 2022, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods:

(1)represents principal amounts of long-term debt to affiliates and third parties at maturity, excluding unamortized premiums, discounts, debt issuance costs, consent fees, and financing lease obligations. see note 8 - debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
(2)future minimum payments, including principal and interest payments, related to the tower obligations. see note 9 - tower obligations of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
(3)the minimum commitment for certain obligations is based on termination penalties that could be paid to exit the contracts. termination penalties are included in the above table as payments due as of the earliest we could exit the contract, typically in less than one year. for certain contracts that include fixed volume purchase commitments and fixed prices for various products, the purchase obligations are calculated using fixed volumes and contractually fixed prices for the products that are expected to be purchased. this table does not include open purchase orders as of december 31, 2022 under normal business purposes. see note 19 - commitments and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
(4)on august 8, 2022, we entered into license purchase agreements to acquire spectrum in the 600 mhz band from channel 51 license co llc and lb license co, llc in exchange for total cash consideration of $3.5 billion. the agreements remain subject to regulatory approval and the purchase price of $3.5 billion is excluded from our reported purchase obligations above.
(5)spectrum lease agreements are typically for five to 10 years with automatic renewal provisions, bringing the total term of the agreements up to 30 years.
certain commitments and obligations are included in the table based on the year of required payment or an estimate of the year of payment. other long-term liabilities have been omitted from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments, combined with the lack of historical trends to predict future payments.
the purchase obligations reflected in the table above are primarily commitments to purchase spectrum licenses, wireless devices, network services, equipment, software, marketing sponsorship agreements and other items in the ordinary course of business. these amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which we are contractually committed. where we are committed to make a minimum payment to the supplier regardless of whether we take delivery, we have included only that minimum payment as a purchase obligation. the acquisition of spectrum licenses is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.
related party transactions we have related party transactions associated with dt or its affiliates in the ordinary course of business, including intercompany servicing and licensing.
as of february 10, 2023, dt and softbank held, directly or indirectly, approximately 49.6% and 3.3%, respectively, of the outstanding t-mobile common stock, with the remaining approximately 47.1% of the outstanding t-mobile common stock held by other stockholders. as a result of the proxy, lock-up and rofr agreement, dated april 1, 2020, by and between dt and softbank and the proxy, lock-up and rofr agreement, dated june 22, 2020, by and among dt, claure mobile llc, and marcelo claure, dt has voting control, as of february 10, 2023, over approximately 53.3% of the outstanding t-mobile common stock.
disclosure of iranian activities under section 13(r) of the exchange act section 219 of the iran threat reduction and the syria human rights act of 2012 added section 13(r) to the exchange act. section 13(r) requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to iran or with designated natural persons or entities involved in terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. disclosure is required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted outside the u.s. by non-u.s. affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under u.s. law.
as of the date of this report, we are not aware of any activity, transaction or dealing by us or any of our affiliates for the year ended december 31, 2022, that requires disclosure in this report under section 13(r) of the exchange act, except as set forth below with respect to affiliates that we do not control and that are our affiliates solely due to their common control with either dt or softbank. we have relied upon dt and softbank for information regarding their respective activities, transactions and dealings.
dt, through certain of its non-u.s. subsidiaries, is party to roaming and interconnect agreements with the following mobile and fixed line telecommunication providers in iran, some of which are or may be government-controlled entities: telecommunication kish company, mobile telecommunication company of iran, and telecommunication infrastructure company of iran. in addition, during the year ended december 31, 2022, dt, through certain of its non-u.s. subsidiaries, provided basic telecommunications services to four customers in germany identified on the specially designated nationals and blocked persons list maintained by the u.s. department of treasury's office of foreign assets control: bank melli, europäisch-iranische handelsbank, cpg engineering & commercial services gmbh and golgohar trade and technology gmbh. these services have been terminated or are in the process of being terminated. for the year ended december 31, 2022, gross revenues of all dt affiliates generated by roaming and interconnection traffic and telecommunications services with the iranian parties identified herein were less than $0.1 million, and the estimated net profits were less than $0.1 million.
in addition, dt, through certain of its non-u.s. subsidiaries that operate a fixed-line network in their respective european home countries (in particular germany), provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to the embassy of iran in those european countries. gross revenues and net profits recorded from these activities for the year ended, were less than $0.1 million. we understand that dt intends to continue these activities.
separately, softbank, through one of its non-u.s. subsidiaries, provides roaming services in iran through irancell telecommunications services company. during the year ended december 31, 2022, softbank had no gross revenues from such services and no net profit was generated. we understand that the softbank subsidiary intends to continue such services. this subsidiary also provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to accounts affiliated with the embassy of iran in japan. during the year ended december 31, 2022, softbank estimates that gross revenues and net profit generated by such services were both under $0.1 million. we understand that the softbank subsidiary is obligated under contract and intends to continue such services.
in addition, softbank, through one of its non-u.s. indirect subsidiaries, provides office supplies to the embassy of iran in japan. softbank estimates that gross revenue and net profit generated by such services during the year ended december 31, 2022, were both under $0.1 million. we understand that the softbank subsidiary intends to continue such activities.
critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition as they require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
two of these policies, discussed below, relate to critical estimates because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. actual results could differ from those estimates.
management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed and approved the accounting policies associated with these critical estimates.
depreciation our property and equipment balance represents a significant component of our consolidated assets. we record property and equipment at cost, and we generally depreciate property and equipment on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. if all other factors were to remain unchanged, we expect that a one-year increase in the useful lives of our in-service property and equipment, exclusive of leased devices, would have resulted in a decrease of approximately $3.1 billion in our 2022 depreciation expense and that a one-year decrease in the useful life would have resulted in an increase of approximately $4.0 billion in our 2022 depreciation expense.
see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies and note 5 - property and equipment of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding depreciation of assets, including management's underlying estimates of useful lives.
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these differences are realized. a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions within the carryforward periods available.
we account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. we assess whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position and adjust the unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law.
the income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate are complex and subject to different interpretations by management and the relevant government taxing authorities. in establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. we must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. our interpretations may be subjected to review during examination by taxing authorities and disputes may arise over the respective tax positions. we attempt to resolve these disputes during the tax examination and audit process and ultimately through the court system when applicable.
we monitor relevant tax authorities and revise our estimate of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities on a quarterly basis. revisions of our estimate of accrued income taxes also may result from our own income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax controversies. such revisions in our estimates may be material to our income tax expense for any given quarter.

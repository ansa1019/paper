item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data of this report and the matters described under item 1a. risk factors.
a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020 is presented below. information on 2019 is included in graphs only to show year over year trends in our results of operations and operating metrics. our financial condition for 2019, results of operations for 2019 and 2020 compared to 2019 and details on the ipt transaction and lpt transaction referenced throughout this document can be found under item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, which is incorporated by reference herein to our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2020, filed with the sec on february 11, 2021, and is available on the sec's website at www.sec.gov and our investor relations website at www.ir.prologis.com.
management's overview summary of 2021
our financial condition and operating results were strong during 2021. e-commerce continues to grow well above its historical average and demand for space is robust based on our proprietary data. as demand surges, having the right logistics real estate in the right location is mission critical for our customers, which is evident with our o&m occupancy at 97.7% at december 31, 2021. leasing activity accelerated for our portfolio during 2021. our outlook for 2022 is equally as promising as we expect increases in market rents and asset valuations to drive our operating results as well as our execution of profitable deployment activities.
we generated net proceeds of $5.2 billion and realized net gains of $1.6 billion, principally from the contribution of properties to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures in japan, europe and the u.s. and dispositions to third parties.
we earned promotes aggregating $98 million ($43 million net of related expenses), primarily during the fourth quarter of 2021 from one of our unconsolidated co-investment ventures in europe.
in december 2021, uklv sold its operating properties to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, pelf and pelp, and its land to us.
we completed the following consolidated financing activities that included the issuance of $2.9 billion and redemption of $1.5 billion of senior notes, with aggregate principal amounts in u.s. dollars. this resulted in a consolidated weighted average remaining maturity of 10 years and lowered our weighted average effective interest rate to 1.6% at december 31, 2021 (principal in millions):

(1)   the exchange rate used to calculate into u.s. dollars was the spot rate at the settlement date.
(3)   the weighted average term represents the remaining maturity in years on the related debt at the issuance or redemption date.
at december 31, 2021, we had total available liquidity of $5.0 billion, principally due to aggregate availability under our credit facilities of $4.4 billion and unrestricted cash balances of $556 million. in april 2021, we increased our available liquidity by entering into a second global senior credit facility with an available borrowing capacity of $1.0 billion and we terminated the $500 million multi-currency term loan.
results of operations we evaluate our business operations based on the noi of our two operating segments: real estate operations and strategic capital. noi by segment is a non-gaap performance measure that is calculated using revenues and expenses directly from our financial statements. we consider noi by segment to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance because it helps management and investors understand our operating results.
below is a reconciliation of our noi by segment to operating income per the consolidated financial statements (in millions). each segment's noi is reconciled to line items in the consolidated financial statements as provided in the related discussion below.

see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our segments and a reconciliation of each business segment's noi to operating income and earnings before income taxes.
real estate operations this operating segment principally includes rental revenue and rental expenses recognized from our consolidated properties. we allocate the costs of our property management and leasing functions to the real estate operations segment through rental expenses and the strategic capital segment through strategic capital expenses based on the square footage of the relative portfolios. in addition, this segment is impacted by our development, acquisition and disposition activities.
below are the components of real estate operations noi, derived directly from line items in the consolidated financial statements (in millions):
development management and other revenues                 20                   11
the change in real estate operations ("reo") noi in 2021 compared to 2020 of approximately $285 million was impacted by the following activities (in millions):
(1)   during both periods, we experienced positive rental rate growth. rental rate growth is a combination of higher rental rates on rollover of leases (or rent change) and contractual rent increases on existing leases. if a lease has a contractual rent increase driven by a metric that is not known at the time the lease commences, such as the consumer price index or a similar metric, the rent increase is not included in rent leveling and therefore impacts the rental revenue we recognize. significant rent change during both periods continues to be a key driver in increasing rental income. see below for key metrics on rent change on rollover and occupancy for the consolidated operating portfolio.
(2)   one of the drivers of the increase in noi in 2021, compared to 2020, was the liberty transaction on february 4, 2020. in the transaction we acquired 519 industrial operating properties, aggregating 100 million square feet, and increased our consolidated investments in real estate by approximately $13 billion.
(3)   we calculate changes in noi from development completions period over period by comparing the change in noi generated on the pool of developments that completed on or after january 1, 2020 through december 31, 2021.
below are key operating metrics of our consolidated operating portfolio, which excludes non-strategic industrial properties.
(1)   in 2020, we completed the liberty transaction.
(2)   consolidated square feet of leases commenced and weighted average net effective rent change were calculated for leases with initial terms of one year or greater.
development activity the following table summarizes consolidated development activity (dollars and square feet in millions):
number of new development projects during the period                     78                  42

estimated value at completion                                        $3,613              $3,383
estimated value creation                                             $1,284                $932
(2)   estimated weighted average margin is calculated on development properties as estimated value creation, less estimated closing costs and taxes, if any, on properties expected to be sold or contributed, divided by tei.
at december 31, 2021, the consolidated development portfolio, including properties under development and pre-stabilized properties, was expected to be completed before october 2023 with a tei of $4.7 billion, leaving $2.0 billion remaining to be spent and was 54.6% leased. while construction costs increased during 2021, we continue to maintain high margins as a result of lower capitalization rates and higher market rents. our current investment in the development portfolio was $2.7 billion and we expect our development activities to increase in 2022. for additional information on our development portfolio at december 31, 2021, see item 2. properties.
capital expenditures we capitalize costs incurred in improving and leasing our operating properties as part of the investment basis or within other assets. the following graph summarizes capitalized expenditures, excluding development costs, and property improvements per average square foot of our consolidated operating properties during each year:
our capital expenditures continue to increase year over year as we grow the consolidated operating portfolio through development stabilizations and acquisitions. we plan to continue allocating capital in 2022 to renovate and modernize our operating portfolio, including the addition of sustainable and efficient building features.
strategic capital this operating segment includes revenues from asset management and property management services performed, transactional services for acquisition, disposition and leasing activity and promote revenue earned from the unconsolidated entities. revenues associated with the strategic capital segment fluctuate because of changes in the size of the portfolios through acquisitions and dispositions, the fair value of the properties and other transactional activity including foreign currency exchange rates and timing of promotes. these revenues are reduced by the direct costs associated with the asset and property-level management expenses for the properties owned by these ventures. we allocate the costs of our property management and leasing functions to the strategic capital segment through strategic capital expenses and to the real estate operations segment through rental expenses based on the square footage of the relative portfolios. for further details regarding the key property information and summarized financial condition and operating results of our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
below are the components of strategic capital noi derived directly from the line items in the consolidated financial statements (in millions):

(1)   the u.s. expenses include compensation and personnel costs for employees who are based in the u.s. but also support other geographies.
(2)   recurring fees include asset management and property management fees. the increase in fees in 2021 as compared to 2020 is due primarily to higher asset management fees driven by the increases in the fair value of the properties based on third party valuations.
(3)   transactional fees include leasing commissions and acquisition, disposition, development and other fees.
(4)   we generally earn promote revenue directly from third-party investors in the co-investment ventures based on the cumulative returns of the venture over a three-year period or the stabilization of individual development projects owned by the venture. an increase in asset valuations in the co-investment ventures, as we have experienced in 2021, is one of the significant drivers of returns that can translate into earning future promote revenues. approximately 40% of the promote earned by us from the co-investment ventures is paid to our employees as a combination of cash and stock awards pursuant to the terms of the ppp and expensed through strategic capital expenses, as vested.
g&a expenses g&a expenses were $294 million and $275 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively. g&a expenses increased in 2021 as compared to 2020, due to higher compensation expenses based largely on our outperformance and the increase in our share price. we capitalize certain internal costs, including salaries and related expenses, directly related primarily to our development activities. for discussion on our long-term incentive plans refer to the proxy statement for our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders.
the following table summarizes capitalized g&a (in millions):
building and land development activities                                                          $95               $73
operating building improvements and other                                                          29                23
total capitalized g&amp;a expenses                                                               $124               $96
capitalized salaries and related costs as a percent of total salaries and related costs          21.9   %          20.2   %
the change in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2021 compared to 2020 of approximately $16 million was impacted by the following activities (in millions):
(1)   included in acquisitions are the operating properties and related intangible assets acquired in the liberty transaction.
gains on real estate transactions, net gains on the disposition of development properties and land were $817 million and $465 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively, and primarily included gains from the contribution of properties we developed to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures in japan, the u.s. and europe. gains on other dispositions of investments in real estate were $773 million and $252 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively, which included sales of operating properties, including certain non-strategic assets acquired in the liberty transaction and the ipt transaction, the contribution of operating properties to our unconsolidated co-investment venture in the u.s. and the sale of our ownership interest in other unconsolidated ventures. we utilized the proceeds from these transactions primarily to fund our development activities during both periods. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on these transactions.
our owned and managed ("o&m") operating portfolio we manage our business and review our operating fundamentals on an o&m basis, which includes our consolidated properties and properties owned by our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. we believe reviewing the fundamentals this way allows management to understand the entire impact to the financial statements, as it will affect both the real estate operations and strategic capital segments, as well as the net earnings we recognize from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures based on our ownership. we do not control the unconsolidated co-investment ventures for purposes of gaap and the presentation of the ventures' operating information does not represent a legal claim.
our o&m operating portfolio does not include our development portfolio, value-added properties, non-industrial properties or properties we do not have the intent to hold long-term that are classified as either held for sale or within other real estate investments. value-added properties are properties we have either acquired at a discount and believe we could provide greater returns post-stabilization or properties we expect to repurpose to a higher and better use. see below for information on our o&m operating portfolio at december 31 (square feet in millions):
below are the key leasing metrics of our o&m operating portfolio.
(1)   square feet of leases commenced and weighted average net effective rent change were calculated for leases with initial terms of one year or greater. we retained approximately 70% or more of our customers, based on the total square feet of leases commenced, for each year.
(2)   turnover costs include external leasing commissions and tenant improvements and represent the obligations incurred in connection with the lease commencement for leases greater than one year. as a result of higher rents on leases that commenced in 2021, leasing commissions on a per square foot basis have continued to increase as commissions are based on the contractual rent we receive over the lease term.
same store analysis our same store metrics are non-gaap financial measures, which are commonly used in the real estate industry and expected from the financial community, on both a net effective and cash basis. we evaluate the performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a "same store" analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period, which allows us and investors to analyze our ongoing business operations. we determine our same store metrics on property noi, which is calculated as rental revenue less rental expense for the applicable properties in the same store population for both consolidated and unconsolidated properties based on our ownership interest, as further defined below.
we define our same store population for the three months ended december 31, 2021 as the properties in our o&m operating portfolio, including the property noi for both consolidated properties and properties owned by the unconsolidated co-investment ventures at january 1, 2020 and owned throughout the same three-month period in both 2020 and 2021. we believe the drivers of property noi for the consolidated portfolio are generally the same for the properties owned by the ventures in which we invest and therefore we evaluate the same store metrics of the o&m portfolio based on prologis' ownership in the properties ("prologis share"). the same store population excludes properties held for sale to third parties, along with development properties that were not stabilized at the beginning of the period (january 1, 2020) and properties acquired or disposed of to third parties during the period. to derive an appropriate measure of period-to-period operating performance, we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the reported period-end exchange rate to translate from local currency into the u.s. dollar, for both periods.
as non-gaap financial measures, the same store metrics have certain limitations as an analytical tool and may vary among real estate companies. as a result, we provide a reconciliation of rental revenues less rental expenses ("property noi") (from our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap) to our same store property noi measures.
we evaluate the results of our same store portfolio on a quarterly basis. the following is a reconciliation of our consolidated rental revenues, rental expenses and property noi for each quarter in 2021 and 2020 to the full year, as included in the consolidated statements of income and within note 19 to the consolidated financial statements and to the respective amounts in our same store portfolio analysis for the three months ended december 31 (dollars in millions):
2021                                                                                                                         2020                                              % change reconciliation of consolidated property noi to same store property noi measures:

(1)   we exclude properties held for sale to third parties, along with development properties that were not stabilized at the beginning of the period and properties acquired or disposed of to third parties during the period. we also exclude net termination and renegotiation fees to allow us to evaluate the growth or decline in each property's rental revenues without regard to one-time items that are not indicative of the property's recurring operating performance. net termination and renegotiation fees represent the gross fee negotiated to allow a customer to terminate or renegotiate their lease, offset by the write-off of the asset recorded due to the adjustment to straight-line rents over the lease term. same store property noi is adjusted to include an allocation of property management expenses for our consolidated properties based on the property management services provided to each property (generally, based on a percentage of revenues). on consolidation, these amounts are eliminated and the actual costs of providing property management and leasing services are recognized as part of our consolidated rental expense.
(2)   we include the property noi for the same store portfolio for both consolidated properties and properties owned by the co-investment ventures based on our investment in the underlying properties. in order to calculate our share of same store property noi from the co-investment ventures in which we own less than 100%, we use the co-investment ventures' underlying property noi for the same store portfolio and apply our ownership percentage at december 31, 2021 to the property noi for both periods, including the properties contributed during the period. we adjust the total property noi from the same store portfolio of the co-investment ventures by subtracting the third parties' share of both consolidated and unconsolidated co-investment ventures.
during the periods presented, certain wholly owned properties were contributed to a co-investment venture and are included in the same store portfolio. neither our consolidated results nor those of the co-investment ventures, when viewed individually, would be comparable on a same store basis because of the changes in composition of the respective portfolios from period to period (e.g. the results of a contributed property are included in our consolidated results through the contribution date and in the results of the venture subsequent to the contribution date based on our ownership interest at the end of the period). as a result, only line items labeled "prologis share of same store property noi" are comparable period over period.
(3)   we further remove certain noncash items (straight-line rent and amortization of fair value lease adjustments) included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap to reflect a same store property noi - cash measure.
we manage our business and compensate our executives based on the same store results of our o&m portfolio at 100% as we manage our portfolio on an ownership blind basis. we calculate those results by including 100% of the properties included in our same store portfolio.
earnings from unconsolidated entities, net we recognized net earnings from unconsolidated entities, which are accounted for using the equity method, of $404 million and $297 million during 2021 and 2020, respectively. included in 2021 is our share of the gains recognized upon the sale of certain non-strategic assets acquired in the ipt transaction and the sale by uklv of its operating properties to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, pelf and pelp.
the earnings we recognize can be impacted by: (i) variances in revenues and expenses of each venture; (ii) the size and occupancy rate of the portfolio of properties owned by each venture; (iii) gains or losses from the dispositions of properties and extinguishment of debt; (iv) our ownership interest in each venture; and (v) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate our share of net earnings to u.s. dollars. see the discussion of our unconsolidated entities above in the strategic capital segment discussion and in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a further breakdown of our share of net earnings recognized.

although our debt balances have increased, interest expense decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020 due to our refinancing activities to redeem higher interest rate senior notes before their stated maturities. as a result of these activities, we lowered the consolidated weighted average effective interest rate on our senior notes from 2.4% on january 1, 2020 to 1.7% on december 31, 2021 while extending the weighted average remaining maturity of our senior notes from 8 to 12 years over the same two-year period.
see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements and the liquidity and capital resources section below, for further discussion of our debt and borrowing costs.
foreign currency and derivative gains (losses), net we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to investments in and earnings from our foreign investments. we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our earnings. we recognize the change in fair value of the undesignated derivative contracts in unrealized gains and losses. upon settlement of these transactions, we recognize realized gains or losses.
we primarily hedge our foreign currency risk related to our investments by borrowing in the currencies in which we invest thereby providing a natural hedge. we have issued debt in a currency that is not the same functional currency of the borrowing entity and have designated a portion of the debt as a nonderivative net investment hedge. we recognize the remeasurement and settlement of the translation adjustment on the unhedged portion of the debt and accrued interest in unrealized gains or losses.

losses on early extinguishment of debt, net we recognized $187 million and $188 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt in 2021 and 2020, respectively. the losses during both periods were driven by the redemption of certain higher interest rate senior notes before their stated maturity. we compare any prepayment penalties incurred from the early redemption of the borrowings to the potential interest savings over the term, and make a decision to refinance the debt when it is economically viable. we redeemed $1.5 billion of senior notes with stated maturities of 2024 and 2025 in 2021 and $2.6 billion of senior notes with stated maturities between 2021 and 2024 in 2020. the losses in 2020 also included the extinguishment of debt assumed in the liberty transaction and the ipt transaction, which represented the excess of the prepayment penalties over the premium recorded upon assumption of the debt. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements and the liquidity and capital resources section, for more information regarding our debt repurchases.
income tax expense we recognize income tax expense related to our taxable reit subsidiaries and in the local, state and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. our current income tax expense fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our taxable income, including gains on the disposition of properties and fees earned from the co-investment ventures. deferred income tax expense (benefit) is generally a function of the period's temporary differences and the utilization of net operating losses generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets in taxable subsidiaries.
the following table summarizes our income tax expense (benefit) (in millions):
income tax expense on dispositions                                                62                41

net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests this amount represents the third-party investors' share of the earnings generated in consolidated entities in which we do not own 100% of the equity, reduced by the third-party share of fees or promotes payable to us and earned during the period. we had net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests of $209 million and $135 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. included in these amounts were $82 million and $42 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, of net earnings attributable to the common limited partnership unitholders of prologis, l.p. the recognition of net gains on the sale of the non-strategic assets identified for disposition in the ipt transaction also increased the net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2021.
see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our noncontrolling interests.
the key driver of changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("aoci/l") in 2021 and 2020 was the currency translation adjustment derived from changes in exchange rates during both periods primarily on our net investments in real estate outside the u.s. and the borrowings we issue in the functional currencies of the countries where we invest. these borrowings serve as a natural hedge of our foreign investments. in addition, we use derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign investments, that when designated the change in fair value is included in aoci/l.
see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our foreign currency and derivative financial instrument policies and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our derivative and nonderivative transactions and other comprehensive income (loss).
environmental matters see note 16 in the consolidated financial statements for further information about environmental liabilities.
liquidity and capital resources overview we consider our ability to generate cash from operating activities, distributions from our co-investment ventures, contributions and dispositions of properties and available financing sources to be adequate to meet our anticipated future development, acquisition, operating, debt service, dividend and distribution requirements.
near-term principal cash sources and uses in addition to dividends and distributions, we expect our primary cash needs will consist of the following:
•   completion of the development and leasing of the properties in our consolidated development portfolio (at december 31, 2021, 99 properties in our development portfolio were 54.6% leased with a current investment of $2.7 billion and a tei of $4.7 billion when completed and leased, leaving $2.0 billion of estimated additional required investment);
•   development of new properties that we may hold for long-term investment or subsequently contribute to unconsolidated co-investment ventures, including the acquisition of land in certain markets;
•   capital expenditures and leasing costs on properties in our operating portfolio;
•   additional investments in current and future unconsolidated co-investment ventures and other ventures; and
•   acquisition of operating properties or portfolios of operating properties (depending on market and other conditions) for direct, long-term investment in our consolidated portfolio (this might include acquisitions from our co-investment ventures).
we expect to fund our cash needs principally from the following sources (subject to market conditions):
•   fees earned for services performed on behalf of co-investment ventures, including promotes;
•   distributions received from co-investment ventures;
•   proceeds from the contributions of properties to current or future co-investment ventures;
•   proceeds from disposition of properties, land parcels or other investments to third parties;
•   borrowing capacity under our current credit facility arrangements ($4.4 billion available at december 31, 2021); and long-term, we may also have a primary cash need related to the voluntary repurchase of our outstanding debt or equity securities (depending on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity, contractual restrictions and other factors) through cash purchases, open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise. we may also fund our cash needs from the issuance of equity securities, subject to market conditions, and the sale of a portion of our investments in co-investment ventures to achieve long-term ownership targets.

our credit ratings at december 31, 2021, were a3 from moody's with a stable outlook and a- from standard & poor's with a positive outlook. these ratings allow us to borrow at an advantageous interest rate. adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our business and, in particular, our refinancing and other capital market activities, our ability to manage debt maturities, our future growth and our development and acquisition activity. a securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization.
at december 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all of our financial debt covenants. these covenants include a number of customary financial covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage ratios, leverage ratios and fixed charge coverage ratios.
see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our debt.
equity commitments related to certain co-investment ventures certain co-investment ventures have equity commitments from us and our venture partners. our venture partners fulfill their equity commitment with cash. we may fulfill our equity commitment through contributions of properties or cash.

currency exchange rates on cash operating activities cash provided by and used in operating activities, exclusive of changes in receivables and payables, was impacted by the following significant activities:
•   real estate operations. we receive the majority of our operating cash through the net revenues of our real estate operations segment, including the recovery of our operating costs. cash flows generated by the real estate operations segment are impacted by our acquisition, development and disposition activities, which are drivers of noi recognized during each period. see the results of operations section above for further explanation of our real estate operations segment. the revenues from this segment include noncash adjustments for straight-lined rents and amortization of above and below market leases of $148 million and $126 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively.
•   strategic capital. we also generate operating cash through our strategic capital segment by providing asset management and property management and other services to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. see the results of operations section above for the key drivers of the net revenues from our strategic capital segment. included in strategic capital revenues is the third-party investors' share that is owed for promotes, which is recognized in operating activities in the period the cash is received, generally the quarter after the revenue is recognized.
•   g&amp;a expenses and equity-based compensation awards. we incurred $294 million and $275 million of g&amp;a expenses in 2021 and 2020, respectively. we recognized equity-based, noncash compensation expenses of $113 million and $110 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, which were recorded to rental expenses in the real estate operations segment, strategic capital expenses in the strategic capital segment and g&amp;a expenses.
•   operating distributions from unconsolidated entities. we received $440 million and $451 million of distributions as a return on our investment from the cash flows generated from the operations of our unconsolidated entities in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
•   cash paid for interest, net of amounts capitalized. we paid interest, net of amounts capitalized, of $279 million and $309 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on this activity.
•   cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds. we paid income taxes, net of refunds, of $149 million and $101 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on this activity.
investing activities cash provided by investing activities is driven by proceeds from contributions and dispositions of real estate. during 2021, our dispositions included significant contributions of properties we developed to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures as well as the sale of operating properties. cash used in investing activities is primarily driven by our capital deployment activities of investing in real estate development, acquisitions and capital expenditures. during 2021, our acquisitions included significant acquisitions of land for future development, operating properties and other real estate assets, including covered land plays to support increased development activities in the future. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on these activities. in addition, the following significant transactions also impacted our cash used in and provided by investing activities:
•   liberty transaction, net of cash acquired. we paid net cash of $29 million to complete the liberty transaction in 2020, primarily due to transaction costs. the acquisition was financed through the issuance of equity and the assumption of debt. a portion of this debt was paid down subsequent to the acquisition, see the financing activities section below. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on this transaction.
•   ipt transaction, net of cash acquired. our consolidated co-investment venture, uslv, acquired real estate assets from ipt for a cash purchase price of $1.7 billion in 2020. our partner in uslv contributed their share of the purchase price, $917 million, which is presented in noncontrolling interests contributions in financing activities. all of the debt assumed was paid down subsequent to the acquisition, see the financing activities section below. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on this transaction.
•   investments in and advances to our unconsolidated entities. we invested cash in our unconsolidated entities that represented our proportionate share, of $798 million and $386 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. the ventures used the funds for the acquisition of properties, development and repayment of debt. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for more detail on our unconsolidated co-investment ventures.
•   return of investment from unconsolidated entities. we received distributions from unconsolidated entities as a return of investment of $58 million and $257 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. included in these amounts were distributions from venture activities including proceeds from property sales, debt refinancing and the redemption of our investment in certain unconsolidated entities.
financing activities cash provided by and used in financing activities is principally driven by proceeds from and payments on credit facilities and other debt, along with dividends paid on common and preferred stock and noncontrolling interest contributions and distributions.
our repurchase of and payments on debt and proceeds from the issuance of debt consisted of the following activity (in millions):
repurchase of and payments on debt (including extinguishment costs)
regularly scheduled debt principal payments and payments at maturity               $10            $10
(1)   we completed the liberty transaction in 2020 and assumed $2.8 billion of debt, of which $1.8 billion was paid off with the proceeds from the issuance of senior notes. uslv assumed $342 million of debt in the ipt transaction, all of which was paid off at closing. the assumption of debt was excluded from the table above.
unconsolidated co-investment venture debt we had investments in and advances to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures of $7.8 billion at december 31, 2021. these ventures listed below had total third-party debt of $12.0 billion at december 31, 2021 with a weighted average remaining maturity of 7 years and weighted average interest rate of 2.2%. certain of our ventures do not have third-party debt and are therefore excluded. this debt is non-recourse to prologis and other investors in the co-investment ventures and bears interest as follows at december 31, 2021 (dollars in millions):
total (1)       weighted average interest rate      gross book value (1)     ownership %
nippon prologis reit                           2,621                                0.6%                     7,198           15.1%
(1)   the weighted average loan-to-value ratio for all unconsolidated co-investment ventures was 25.4% at december 31, 2021. loan-to-value, a non-gaap measure, was calculated as the percentage of total third-party debt to the gross book value of real estate for each venture and weighted based on the cumulative gross book value of all unconsolidated co-investment ventures.
at december 31, 2021, we did not guarantee any third-party debt of the unconsolidated co-investment ventures. in our role as the manager or sponsor, we work with the co-investment ventures to maintain sufficient liquidity and refinance their maturing debt. there can be no assurance that the co-investment ventures will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness on terms as favorable as the maturing debt, or at all. if the ventures are unable to refinance the maturing indebtedness with newly issued debt, they may be able to obtain funds by voluntary capital contributions from us and our partners or by selling assets. certain of our ventures also have credit facilities, or unencumbered properties, both of which may be used to obtain funds.
dividend and distribution requirements our dividend policy on our common stock is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure that we will meet the dividend requirements of the irc, relative to maintaining our reit status, while still allowing us to retain cash to fund our capital deployment and other investment activities.
under the irc, reits may be subject to certain federal income and excise taxes on undistributed taxable income.
we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.63 and $0.58 per common share in 2021 and 2020, respectively. our future common stock dividends, if and as declared, may vary and will be determined by the board based upon the circumstances prevailing at the time, including our financial condition, operating results and reit distribution requirements, and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board during the year.
we make distributions on the common limited partnership units outstanding at the same per unit amount as our common stock dividend. the class a units in the op are entitled to a quarterly distribution equal to $0.64665 per unit so long as the common units receive a quarterly distribution of at least $0.40 per unit. we paid a quarterly cash distribution of $0.64665 per class a unit in 2021 and 2020.
pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock, we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock.
other commitments on an ongoing basis, we are engaged in various stages of negotiations for the acquisition or disposition of individual properties or portfolios of properties.
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that involves an estimate or assumption that is subjective and requires management judgment about the effect of a matter that is inherently uncertain and material to an entity's financial condition and results of operations. management's judgment considers historical and current economic conditions and expectations for the future. changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance. of the significant accounting policies discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, those presented below have been identified by us as meeting the criteria to be considered critical accounting policies as they relate to our financial condition as of the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020 and our operating results for the three-year period ended december 31, 2021. refer to note 2 for more information on these critical accounting policies.
asset acquisitions we generally account for an acquisition of a single property or portfolio of properties as an asset acquisition. we measure the real estate assets acquired through an asset acquisition based on their cost or total consideration exchanged and any excess consideration or bargain purchase amount is allocated to the real estate properties and related lease intangibles on a relative fair value basis. assets we do not intend to hold long-term are recorded at fair value. at a property-level, we allocate the fair value to the components, which include building, land, improvements, and intangible assets or liabilities related to acquired leases. the most significant portion of the allocation is to building and land and requires the use of market based estimates and assumptions.
the purchase price allocation is based on the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located utilizing an income approach methodology, which may be a discounted cash flow analysis or applying a capitalization rate to the estimated noi of a property. key assumptions include market rents, growth rates, and discount and capitalization rates. estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known trends and market and economic conditions. we determine discount and capitalization rates by market based on recent transactions and other market data and adjust if necessary, based on the property characteristics. the fair value of land is generally based on relevant market data, such as a comparison of the subject site to similar parcels that have recently been sold or are currently being offered on the market for sale. the use of different assumptions to value the acquired properties and allocate the most significant portion of the property value between the building and land could affect the expenses we recognize over the estimated remaining useful life.
recoverability of real estate assets we assess the carrying values of our respective long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable. this assessment is primarily triggered based on the shortening of the expected hold period due to our change in intent to sell a property in the near term. we have processes to monitor our intent with regard to our investments and the estimated disposition value in comparison to the current carrying value. if our assessment of potential triggering events indicates that the carrying value of a property that we expect to sell in the near term is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the property. we determine the fair value of the property based on the proceeds from disposition that are estimated based on quoted market values, third-party appraisals or discounted cash flow models that utilize the future noi of the property and expected market capitalization rates. the use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business. changes in economic and operating conditions could impact our intent and the assumptions used in determining the fair value that could result in future impairment.
new accounting pronouncements see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
funds from operations attributable to common stockholders/unitholders ("ffo")
ffo is a non-gaap financial measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry. the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo is net earnings.
the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") defines ffo as earnings computed under gaap to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales net of any related tax, along with impairment charges, of previously depreciated properties. we also exclude the gains on revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest and the gain recognized from a partial sale of our investment, as these are similar to gains from the sales of previously depreciated properties. we exclude similar adjustments from our unconsolidated entities and the third parties' share of our consolidated co-investment ventures.
our ffo measures our ffo measures begin with nareit's definition and we make certain adjustments to reflect our business and the way that management plans and executes our business strategy. while not infrequent or unusual, the additional items we adjust for in calculating ffo, as modified by prologis and core ffo, both as defined below, are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period. although these items may have a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements, the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the long term. these items have both positive and negative short-term effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our long-term outlook.
we calculate our ffo measures, as defined below, based on our proportionate ownership share of both our unconsolidated and consolidated ventures. we reflect our share of our ffo measures for unconsolidated ventures by applying our average ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis. we reflect our share for consolidated ventures in which we do not own 100% of the equity by adjusting our ffo measures to remove the noncontrolling interests share of the applicable reconciling items based on our average ownership percentage for the applicable periods.
these ffo measures are used by management as supplemental financial measures of operating performance and we believe that it is important that stockholders, potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses. we do not use our ffo measures as, nor should they be considered to be, alternatives to net earnings computed under gaap, as indicators of our operating performance, as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under gaap or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs.
we analyze our operating performance principally by the rental revenue of our real estate and the revenues from our strategic capital business, net of operating, administrative and financing expenses. this income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities.
ffo, as modified by prologis attributable to common stockholders/unitholders ("ffo, as modified by prologis")
to arrive at ffo, as modified by prologis, we adjust the nareit defined ffo measure to exclude the impact of foreign currency related items and deferred tax, specifically:
•   deferred income tax benefits and deferred income tax expenses recognized by our subsidiaries;
•   current income tax expense related to acquired tax liabilities that were recorded as deferred tax liabilities in an acquisition, to the extent the expense is offset with a deferred income tax benefit in earnings that is excluded from our defined ffo measure; and
•   foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from (i) debt transactions between us and our foreign entities, (ii) third-party debt that is used to hedge our investment in foreign entities, (iii) derivative financial instruments related to any such debt transactions, and (iv) mark-to-market adjustments associated with other derivative financial instruments.
we use ffo, as modified by prologis, so that management, analysts and investors are able to evaluate our performance against other reits that do not have similar operations or operations in jurisdictions outside the u.s.
core ffo attributable to common stockholders/unitholders ("core ffo")
in addition to ffo, as modified by prologis, we also use core ffo. to arrive at core ffo, we adjust ffo, as modified by prologis, to exclude the following recurring and nonrecurring items that we recognize directly in ffo, as modified by prologis:
•   gains or losses from the disposition of land and development properties that were developed with the intent to contribute or sell;
•   income tax expense related to the sale of investments in real estate;
•   impairment charges recognized related to our investments in real estate generally as a result of our change in intent to contribute or sell these properties;
•   gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt and redemption and repurchase of preferred stock; and we use core ffo, including by segment and region, to: (i) assess our operating performance as compared to other real estate companies; (ii) evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods; (iii) evaluate the performance of our management; (iv) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources; (v) provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our expected operating performance; and (vi) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results.
limitations on the use of our ffo measures while we believe our modified ffo measures are important supplemental measures, neither nareit's nor our measures of ffo should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under gaap and are, therefore, limited as an analytical tool. accordingly, these are only a few of the many measures we use when analyzing our business. some of the limitations are:
•   depreciation and amortization of real estate assets are economic costs that are excluded from ffo. ffo is limited, as it does not reflect the cash requirements that may be necessary for future replacements of the real estate assets. furthermore, the amortization of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of logistics facilities are not reflected in ffo.
•   gains or losses from property dispositions and impairment charges related to expected dispositions represent changes in value of the properties. by excluding these gains and losses, ffo does not capture realized changes in the value of disposed properties arising from changes in market conditions.
•   the deferred income tax benefits and expenses that are excluded from our modified ffo measures result from the creation of a deferred income tax asset or liability that may have to be settled at some future point. our modified ffo measures do not currently reflect any income or expense that may result from such settlement.
•   the foreign currency exchange gains and losses that are excluded from our modified ffo measures are generally recognized based on movements in foreign currency exchange rates through a specific point in time. the ultimate settlement of our foreign currency-denominated net assets is indefinite as to timing and amount. our ffo measures are limited in that they do not reflect the current period changes in these net assets that result from periodic foreign currency exchange rate movements.
•   the gains and losses on extinguishment of debt or preferred stock that we exclude from our core ffo, may provide a benefit or cost to us as we may be settling our obligation at less or more than our future obligation.
•   the natural disaster expenses that we exclude from core ffo are costs that we have incurred.
we compensate for these limitations by using our ffo measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap when making our decisions. this information should be read with our complete consolidated financial statements prepared under gaap. to assist investors in compensating for these limitations, we reconcile our modified ffo measures to our net earnings computed under gaap as follows (in millions):

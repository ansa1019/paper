item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this 2021 form 10-k to enhance the understanding of our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
the comparison of 2020 to 2019 results has been omitted from this form 10-k and is incorporated by reference from our form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2020-"item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" filed on february 10, 2021.
executive summary bristol-myers squibb company is a global biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases. refer to the summary of abbreviated terms at the end of this 2021 form 10-k for terms used throughout the document.
in 2021, we obtained more than 20 approvals for new medicines and additional indications and formulations of currently marketed medicines in major markets (the u.s., eu and japan), including regulatory approvals of breyanzi and abecma in hematology malignancies, the first approvals of our cell therapy portfolio. in support of our continued investment in our cell therapy portfolio, we are expanding our manufacturing capabilities through the construction of new state-of-the-art cell therapy manufacturing facilities in devens, massachusetts, and leiden, netherlands. we continue to see momentum in our immuno-oncology portfolio with additional approvals for both opdivo and opdivo+yervoy in various indications (e.g. adjuvant bladder, gastric cancer, gastroesophageal junction cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma and rcc) and the return to growth of opdivo. our portfolio in immunology has expanded with the fda approval of zeposia for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active uc and we have an important opportunity for deucravacitinib, our tyk2 inhibitor, for the treatment of psoriasis and other immune-mediated diseases. we bolstered our leading cardiovascular franchise by adding mavacamten with the acquisition of myokardia in 2020. in 2021, the fda accepted the nda for mavacamten for patients with symptomatic obstructive hcm and assigned a revised pdufa goal date of april 28, 2022.
in 2021, our revenues increased 9%, due to eliquis, opdivo/yervoy, our recently launched new products, revlimid and foreign exchange. the gaap eps of $3.12 in 2021 as compared to the gaap loss per share of $3.99 in 2020 was primarily due to (i) iprd and other charges resulting from the myokardia asset acquisition in 2020, (ii) other specified items including lower unwinding of inventory purchase price adjustments and other income related to equity investments and contingent value rights and (iii) internal transfers of certain intangible and other assets to streamline our legal entity structure subsequent to the celgene acquisition resulting in a tax benefit in 2021 and a tax charge in 2020. after adjusting for specified items, non-gaap eps increased $1.07 due to higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses to support product launches and the overall portfolio.
highlights the following table summarizes our financial information:
year ended december 31, dollars in millions, except per share data                   2021                            2020
our non-gaap financial measures, including non-gaap earnings and related eps information, are adjusted to exclude specified items that represent certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other items impacting the comparability of financial results. for a detailed listing of all specified items and further information and reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures refer to "-non-gaap financial measures."
economic and market factors covid-19
in response to the covid-19 pandemic, international, federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities have taken, and continue to take, a number of actions to limit the spread of covid-19 and address related disruptions in the u.s. and global economy. while we continue to experience impacts on revenues from covid-19 primarily due to lower new patient starts and patient visits, the pandemic has not significantly impacted our results of operations. the situation remains dynamic and it is difficult to reasonably assess or predict the full extent of the negative impact that the covid-19 pandemic may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the future financial and operational impact of the covid-19 pandemic on bms will depend on future developments such as the ultimate duration and the severity of the spread of covid-19 and any variant strains in the u.s. and globally, the effectiveness and outreach of vaccines, the effectiveness of federal, state, local and international government's mitigation actions, the pandemic's impact on the u.s. and global economies, changes in the behavior of patients and medical professionals and the timing for resumption to our normal operations, as well as developments affecting healthcare and the delivery of medicines to patients. see "part i-item 1a. risk factors-general risks-the covid-19 pandemic is affecting our business and could have a material adverse effect on us."
as the covid-19 pandemic affected global healthcare systems as well as major economic and financial markets, we adopted several procedures focused on ensuring the continued supply of our medicines to our patients and protecting the health, wellbeing and safety of our workforce:
workplace and community
•we are maintaining our steadfast commitment to protecting our workforce, communities and patients, and ensuring the continued supply of life-saving medicines.
•as a science-based company, we have a social responsibility to help reduce the spread of the virus. vaccinations are required for generally all of our employees in the u.s. and puerto rico subject to any local regulations which limit or restrict vaccine mandates, and we are encouraged that as of january 5, 2022 approximately 99% of our employees in these regions are vaccinated against covid-19. requests for medical or religious accommodations are also considered on an individual basis. although local regulations and conditions in other ex-u.s. jurisdictions may limit or restrict vaccine mandates, we are committed to implementing similar requirements in other markets wherever possible.
•as we return workers to the office, we will continue to assess the need to require weekly asymptomatic testing, mask wearing, and physical distancing of all colleagues onsite at our facilities in the u.s. and puerto rico. we also keep our workforce safe by conducting regular deep cleaning of our sites.
•our manufacturing sites have remained open throughout the pandemic supported by on site personnel. we have taken a thoughtful and phased approach to bringing the rest of our workforce back to our 195 plus sites around the world, guided by the following principles:
◦serving the needs of our patients and customers
◦prioritizing health and safety
◦leading with compassion and flexibility
◦modeling key learnings
•no single approach fits for every site or market - our timelines and circumstances have varied across the globe. we are monitoring local conditions and government direction closely and adjusting our plans as appropriate.
supply of our medicines and support to patients, physicians and advocacy groups
•an important element of keeping our promise to patients, their families and our healthcare providers is to ensure that our supply chain is robust and carefully managed. our clinical and commercial supply chain teams have proactively used mitigation plans to ensure our products reach our markets, clinical sites and patients over the past months. thanks to these efforts, we have not seen any significant disruptions in our clinical or commercial supply chain due to the pandemic.
•we recognize this remains a challenging time for everyone, and we know patients may be facing additional hardships. our existing patient support programs are available to help eligible patients in the u.s. who have been prescribed a bristol myers squibb medicine and have lost employment and health insurance due to the covid-19 pandemic. under these programs, eligible patients are provided certain bristol myers squibb medicines for free.
•all of our u.s. and puerto rico personnel are currently required to be vaccinated to interact with customers, vendors and people at our clinical trial sites. we are also continuing to employ remote interactions as appropriate to ensure continued support for healthcare professionals, patient care, and access to our medicines across our global markets.
our clinical trials and research
•we are working with health authorities and investigators to protect our trial participants and personnel at bms and our clinical trial sites, while ensuring regulatory compliance and the integrity of our science.
•we have provided clinical trial investigators with overarching principles and guidance regarding the conduct of bms clinical trials worldwide in light of covid-19, and are taking into account guidance from health authorities, where applicable.
governmental actions our products continue to be subject to increasing pressures across the portfolio from pharmaceutical market access and pricing controls and discounting, changes to tax and importation laws and other restrictions in the u.s., the eu and other regions around the world that result in lower prices, lower reimbursement rates and smaller populations for whom payers will reimburse, which can negatively impact our results of operations (including intangible asset impairment charges), operating cash flow, liquidity and financial flexibility. for example, congress is currently considering a number of different proposals that would potentially: (i) allow the government to set or negotiate prices for prescription drugs, including benchmarking those prices to prices paid in other countries, (ii) penalize manufacturers for price increases beyond inflationary measures, (iii) redesign the part d benefit with new out of pocket limits for patients and new mandated discounts for manufacturers, and (iv) change u.s. income tax laws resulting in an increase to our income tax expense, including through increased taxation of our international operations. the outcome of these congressional actions remains highly uncertain. in addition, the oecd recently reached agreement on a global minimum tax pursuant to which countries are expected to implement changes to their tax laws and updates to international tax treaties. see risk factor on the company's risk factors on these items included under "part i-item 1a. risk factors-product, industry and operational risks-increased pricing pressure and other restrictions in the u.s. and abroad continue to negatively affect our revenues and profit margins" and "-changes to tax regulations could negatively impact our earnings."

refer to "-product and pipeline developments" for all of the developments in our marketed products and late-stage pipeline in 2021 and in early 2022.
strategy our principal strategy is to combine the resources, scale and capability of a pharmaceutical company with the speed and focus on innovation of the biotech industry. our focus as a biopharmaceutical company is on discovering, developing and delivering transformational medicines for patients facing serious diseases in areas where we believe that we have an opportunity to make a meaningful difference: oncology (both solid tumors and hematology), immunology, cardiovascular and neurology. our priorities are to continue to renew and diversify our portfolio through launching our new product portfolio, advancing our early, mid and late-stage pipeline, and executing disciplined business development. we remain committed to reducing our debt and returning capital to shareholders.
we are developing new medicines in the following core therapeutic areas: (i) oncology with a priority in certain tumor types; (ii) hematology with opportunities to broaden our franchise and potentially sustain a leadership position in multiple myeloma; (iii) immunology with priorities in relapsing multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, lupus, ra and inflammatory bowel disease; (iv) cardiovascular disease and; (v) fibrotic disease with priorities in lung and liver. we continue to advance the next wave of innovative medicines by investing significantly in our pipeline both internally and through business development activities. we have expanded our oncology, hematology and immunology portfolios with several near-term assets and additional external partnerships. we have invested in our oncology portfolio by pursuing both monotherapy and combination approaches and advancing our next wave of early assets and to explore new collaboration opportunities across our therapeutic areas of focus. we remain focused and well-resourced in our cancer development programs and seek to broaden the use of opdivo in earlier lines of therapy, expand into new tumors, accelerate next wave oncology mechanisms and develop treatment options for refractory oncology patients. we are further strengthening our io portfolio with another opportunity of relatlimab in a fixed dose combination with nivolumab for the treatment of melanoma and expanded opportunities in adjuvant melanoma, lung, liver and crc. for hematology, we have opportunities to launch several new medicines in the near-term with additional pipeline opportunities in the longer term. there is a broad effort to continue to address the unmet medical need in multiple myeloma and we are working across multiple modalities and mechanisms of action such as cereblon modulators ("celmods"), t-cell engagers and car t-cell therapies.
beyond cancer, we continue to advance our early stage portfolio in immunology, cardiovascular and neuroscience diseases and strengthen our partnerships with a diverse group of companies and academic institutions in new and expanded research activities. we believe our differentiated internal and external focus contributes to the advancing of our pipeline of potentially transformational medicines. for immunology with deucravacitinib, our selective tyk2, there is opportunity to be a medicine that could treat multiple immune-mediated diseases. the fda has accepted our nda for deucravacitinib for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and has set a pdufa goal date of september 10, 2022. we are expanding our portfolio for cardiovascular disease with our alliance partnership with janssen where we are advancing a next-generation antithrombotic medicine in milvexian. additionally, through the acquisition of myokardia, we have added mavacamten, which has the potential to be a first-in-class medicine to treat the underlying cause of obstructive hcm. the fda has accepted the nda for mavacamten for this indication and assigned a revised pdufa goal date of april 28, 2022.
our commercial model has been successful with revenues from our key brands continuing to grow, which demonstrates strong execution of our strategy. we continue to drive adoption of opdivo by expanding into additional indications and tumor types both as a monotherapy and in combination with yervoy and other anti-cancer agents. eliquis continues to grow, leveraging its best in class clinical profile and extensive real world data and is now the number one novel oral anticoagulant in total prescriptions globally. revlimid and pomalyst have not only transformed the treatment of multiple myeloma, but as we gained deeper understanding of the mechanism of action of revlimid and pomalyst, we have leveraged that knowledge to intentionally design novel celmod agents, iberdomide and cc-92480, to improve upon these earlier treatments. we are able to leverage our leading capabilities in hematological malignancies and our robust pipeline to provide opportunities for long-term growth to offset the impact of future patent expires for revlimid and pomalyst. we are building on the continued success of our other key brands and remain strongly committed to orencia and sprycel. we are also optimistic on the future growth and near-term opportunities of reblozyl, inrebic, zeposia, onureg, breyanzi and abecma. through our operating model transformation, our commercial infrastructure is leveraged for potential growth.
we expect the growth in our in-line and new product portfolio will enable us to more than offset the expected decline in revlimid, abraxane and other products revenues due to their loss of market exclusivity through 2025.
our operating model continues to evolve and we have been successful in focusing commercial, r&d and manufacturing resources on key brands and markets, strengthening our r&d capabilities in tumor biology, patient selection and new biomarkers, delivering leaner administrative functions and streamlining our manufacturing network to reflect the importance of biologics in our current and future portfolio. the evolution in our operating model, which focuses on maintaining a disciplined approach in marketing, selling and administrative expenses, will enable us to deliver the necessary strategic, financial and operational flexibility to invest in the highest priority opportunities within our portfolio. through our celgene acquisition restructuring activities, we expect to realize approximately $3.0 billion of synergies resulting from cost savings and avoidance through 2022 and our integration efforts across general and administrative, manufacturing, r&d, procurement and streamlining the company's pricing and information technology infrastructure.
looking ahead, we will continue to implement our biopharma strategy by driving the growth of key brands, executing product launches, investing in our diverse and innovative pipeline, aided by strategic business development, focusing on prioritized markets, increasing investments in our biologics manufacturing capabilities and maintaining a culture of continuous improvement.

united states
•europe revenues in 2021 increased due to eliquis, revlimid, opdivo/yervoy and foreign exchange, partially offset by lower demand for mature and other brands. average net selling prices were lower in 2021 compared to the same period a year ago.
•rest of the world revenues in 2021 increased due to opdivo/yervoy, pomalyst/imnovid and eliquis, partially offset by lower revenues for abraxane, due to manufacturing delays, and mature and other brands. average net selling prices were lower in 2021 compared to the same period a year ago.
no single country outside the u.s. contributed more than 10% of total revenues in 2021 and 2020. our business is typically not seasonal.
gtn adjustments we recognize revenue net of gtn adjustments that are further described in "-critical accounting policies."

revlimid (lenalidomide) - an oral immunomodulatory drug that in combination with dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma. revlimid as a single agent is also indicated as a maintenance therapy in patients with multiple myeloma following autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
•international revenues increased 8% in 2021 due to higher demand and foreign exchange impacts of 3%. excluding foreign exchange impacts, revenues increased by 5%.
•in the u.s., certain third parties have been granted volume-limited licenses to sell generic lenalidomide beginning in march 2022 or thereafter. in the eu, licenses have been granted to third parties to market generic lenalidomide products prior to expiry of our patent and supplementary protection certificate rights beginning in the uk in january 2022 and in various other major market european countries (e.g. france, germany, italy and spain) where our supplementary protection certificate is in force beginning in february 2022. in japan, the estimated minimum market exclusivity date is based on a composition of matter patent, which expires in july 2022. global revenues for revlimid are expected to decline to approximately $9.5 billion to $10.0 billion in 2022.
eliquis (apixaban) - an oral factor xa inhibitor, indicated for the reduction in risk of stroke/systemic embolism in nvaf and for the treatment of dvt/pe and reduction in risk of recurrence following initial therapy.
•u.s. revenues increased 18% in 2021 due to higher demand. a majority of eliquis patients enter the coverage gap during the third and fourth quarters which result in lower revenues during the second half of the year.
•international revenues increased 17% in 2021 due to higher demand and foreign exchange impacts of 3%. excluding foreign exchange impacts, revenues increased by 14%.
•in september 2021, the bristol myers squibb-pfizer alliance announced that the court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed the u.s. district court's august 2020 decision finding the composition of matter patent and formulation patent covering eliquis valid and infringed. given the decision, the earliest that generic manufacturers are permitted to launch their apixaban products is april 1, 2028, subject to additional challenges.
following the may 2021 expiration of regulatory exclusivity for eliquis in europe, generic manufacturers may seek to market generic versions of eliquis in europe prior to the expiration of our patents, which may lead to additional, infringement and invalidity actions involving our eliquis patents being filed in various countries in europe. we believe in the innovative science behind eliquis and the strength of our intellectual property, which we will defend against infringement. refer to "item 1. financial statements-note 19. legal proceedings and contingencies-intellectual property" for further information.

•international revenues decreased due to lower demand and lower average net selling prices resulting from generic competition.
estimated end-user demand pursuant to the sec consent order described under "-sec consent order", we monitor the level of inventory on hand in the u.s. wholesaler distribution channel and outside of the u.s. in the direct customer distribution channel. we are obligated to disclose products with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception. estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel in excess of one month on hand for the following products were not material to our results of operations as of the dates indicated.
abraxane had 1.4 months of inventory on hand internationally in the distribution channel at september 30, 2021 compared to 1.9 months of inventory on hand at june 30, 2021 due to on-going business transition from a distributor and to avert a forecasted back order in latin america.
in the u.s., we generally determine our months on hand estimates using inventory levels of product on hand and the amount of out-movement provided by our three largest wholesalers, which account for approximately 76% of total gross sales of u.s. products for the year ended december 31, 2021. factors that may influence our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, wholesaler purchases in light of increases in wholesaler list prices, new product launches, new warehouse openings by wholesalers and new customer stockings by wholesalers. in addition, these estimates are calculated using third-party data, which may be impacted by their recordkeeping processes.
revlimid and pomalyst are distributed in the u.s. primarily through contracted pharmacies under the lenalidomide rems and pomalyst rems programs, respectively. these are proprietary risk-management distribution programs tailored specifically to provide for the safe and appropriate distribution and use of revlimid and pomalyst. internationally, revlimid and imnovid are distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution programs tailored to meet local authorities' specifications to provide for the products' safe and appropriate distribution and use. these programs may vary by country and, depending upon the country and the design of the risk-management program, the product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies.
our non-u.s. businesses have significantly more direct customers. information on available direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information varies widely. we limit our direct customer sales channel inventory reporting to where we can influence demand. when this information does not exist or is otherwise not available, we have developed a variety of methodologies to estimate such data, including using historical sales made to direct customers and third-party market research data related to prescription trends and end-user demand. given the difficulties inherent in estimating third-party demand information, we evaluate our methodologies to estimate direct customer product level inventory and to calculate months on hand on an ongoing basis and make changes as necessary. factors that may affect our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, price increases, new product launches, new warehouse openings by direct customers, new customer stockings by direct customers and expected direct customer purchases for governmental bidding situations. as such, all of the information required to estimate months on hand in the direct customer distribution channel for non-u.s. business for the year ended december 31, 2021 is not available prior to the filing of this 2021 form 10-k. we will disclose any product with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception, in the next quarterly report on form 10-q.

cost of products sold cost of products sold include material, internal labor and overhead costs from our owned manufacturing sites, third-party product supply costs and other supply chain costs managed by our global manufacturing and supply organization. cost of products sold also includes royalties and profit sharing, certain excise taxes, foreign currency hedge settlement gains and losses and impairment charges. cost of products sold typically vary between periods as a result of product mix and volume (particularly royalties and profit sharing), and to a lesser extent changes in foreign currency, price, inflation, costs attributed to manufacturing site exits and impairment charges. cost of products sold excludes amortization from acquired intangible assets.
•cost of products sold decreased by $1.8 billion in 2021 primarily due to lower unwinding of inventory purchase price adjustments ($2.4 billion), lower impairments of acquired marketed product rights ($260 million), partially offset by higher profit sharing and royalties due to eliquis revenue growth and expiration of sprycel co-promotion fee ($539 million) and higher product and manufacturing related costs.
marketing, selling and administrative marketing, selling and administrative expenses primarily include salary and benefit costs, third-party professional and marketing fees, outsourcing fees, shipping and handling costs, advertising and product promotion costs. expenses are managed through regional commercialization organizations or global enabling functions such as finance, legal, information technology and human resources. certain expenses are shared with alliance partners based upon contractual agreements.
•marketing, selling and administrative expenses remained unchanged in 2021 primarily due to higher advertising and promotion expenses and costs to support new product launches, offset by a cash settlement of myokardia unvested stock awards ($241 million) in 2020 and acceleration of charitable giving ($280 million) in 2020.
research and development research and development activities include research and early discovery, preclinical and clinical development, drug formulation and medical support of marketed products. expenses include salary and benefit costs, third-party grants and fees paid to clinical research organizations, supplies, up-front and contingent milestone payments for licensing and asset acquisitions of investigational compounds, iprd impairment charges and proportionate allocations of enterprise-wide costs. the allocations include facilities, information technology, employee stock compensation costs and other appropriate costs. certain expenses are shared with alliance partners based upon contractual agreements. expenses typically vary between periods for a number of reasons, including the timing of license and asset acquisition charges and iprd impairment charges.
•research and development expense increased $211 million in 2021 primarily due to higher costs associated with the overall portfolio and the impact of significant charges summarized below.
significant charges included in research and development expense were as follows:

research and development significant charges             $1,823                          $1,906
license and acquisition charges are related to obtaining rights to investigational compounds that will be developed further by the company. these acquisition costs include the initial up-front payment and additional contingent payments if substantive development and regulatory milestones are achieved prior to regulatory approval. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 3. alliances" and "-note 4. acquisitions, divestitures, licensing and other arrangements" for further information on these charges. iprd impairment charges relate to orva-cel in 2020 and two other programs in 2021 being studied as potential treatments in hematologic and fibrotic diseases. refer to item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 14. goodwill and other intangible assets" for further information on these charges. employee compensation charges resulted from the cash settlement of myokardia unvested stock awards in 2020. site exit costs resulted from celgene integration activities in 2020.
iprd charge - myokardia acquisition iprd charges represents the costs of iprd assets acquired in a transaction other than a business combination.
•the myokardia acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition because substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (excluding cash and deferred taxes) was allocated to a single asset, mavacamten. the iprd charge related to the myokardia transaction is presented separately due to the significance of the charge.
amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of intangible assets primarily relates to revlimid, pomalyst/imnovid and other marketed product rights obtained in the celgene acquisition.
•amortization of acquired intangible assets increased by $335 million in 2021 due to additional product approvals.
•other (income)/expense, net changed by $1.6 billion in 2021, primarily due to contingent value rights, equity investments and other items discussed below.

•equity investment gains includes fair value adjustments for investments that have readily determinable fair value and observable price changes for investments without readily determinable fair values resulting primarily from initial public offerings or third-party acquisitions of entities which we held an ownership interest. our share of income from equity method investments are primarily due to fair value adjustments attributed to limited partnerships. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 9. financial instruments and fair value measurements" for more information.
•integration expenses primarily includes consulting fees to implement celgene integration initiatives related to processes and systems.
•contingent consideration primarily includes fair value adjustments resulting from the change in the traded price of contingent value rights issued with the celgene acquisition. the contractual obligation to pay the contingent value rights terminated in january 2021 because the fda did not approve liso-cel (jcar017) by december 31, 2020.
•provision for restructuring includes exit and other costs primarily related to the celgene acquisition plan. we have achieved approximately $2.6 billion of annualized pre-tax cost savings in 2020 related to the celgene acquisition plan and are on track to achieve the annualized pre-tax cost savings of approximately $3.0 billion through 2022 as detailed in the restructuring activities. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 6. restructuring" for further information.
•litigation and other settlements includes bms's share of a patent-infringement settlement related to roche group's pd-l1 antibody tecentriq* in 2020.

the tax impact attributed to specified items was primarily due to low jurisdictional tax rates attributed to the unwinding of inventory purchase price adjustments and intangible asset amortization, iprd impairment charges, contingent value rights fair value adjustments that are not taxable or deductible and internal transfers of intangible assets. in 2021, a $1.0 billion income tax benefit was recognized due to a revaluation of the tax basis of certain intangible and other assets that were internally transferred to streamline our legal entity structure subsequent to the celgene acquisition. in 2020, an $853 million deferred tax charge resulting from an internal transfer of certain intangible assets to the u.s. to streamline our legal entity structure subsequent to the celgene acquisition and an additional $266 million gilti tax charge upon finalization of the otezla* divestiture tax consequences with tax authorities was recognized. the 0.3% increase in the effective tax rate excluding specified items during 2021 was due to favorable discrete tax adjustments of approximately $140 million in 2020 primarily resulting from finalization of prior year tax returns, partially offset by jurisdictional earnings mix. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 7. income taxes" for additional information.
non-gaap financial measures our non-gaap financial measures, such as non-gaap earnings and related eps information, are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that are evaluated on an individual basis. these items are adjusted after considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects and typically have one or more of the following characteristics, such as being highly variable, difficult to project, unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of future operating results. similar charges or gains were recognized in prior periods and will likely reoccur in future periods including (i) amortization of acquired intangible assets, including product rights that generate a significant portion of our ongoing revenue and will recur until the intangible assets are fully amortized, (ii) unwind of inventory purchase price adjustments, (iii) acquisition and integration expenses, (iv) restructuring costs, (v) accelerated depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, (vi) r&d charges or other income resulting from up-front or contingent milestone payments in connection with the acquisition or licensing of third-party intellectual property rights, (vii) divestiture gains or losses, (viii) stock compensation resulting from accelerated vesting of celgene awards and certain retention-related employee compensation charges related to the celgene transaction, (ix) pension, legal and other contractual settlement charges, (x) equity investment and contingent value rights fair value adjustments, including adjustments attributed to limited partnership equity method investments and (xi) amortization of fair value adjustments of debt acquired from celgene in our 2019 exchange offer, among other items. deferred and current income taxes attributed to these items are also adjusted for considering their individual impact to the overall tax expense, deductibility and jurisdictional tax rates. certain other significant tax items are also excluded such as the impact resulting from internal transfers of intangible and other assets to streamline our legal entity structure subsequent to the celgene acquisition and the gilti tax charge upon finalization of the otezla* divestiture in 2020. we also provide international revenues for our priority products excluding the impact of foreign exchange. we calculate foreign exchange impacts by converting our current-period local currency financial results using the prior period average currency rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current-period results. reconciliations of these non-gaap measures to the most comparable gaap measures are included in exhibit 99.2 to our form 8-k filed on february 4, 2022 and are incorporated herein by reference.
non-gaap information is intended to portray the results of our baseline performance, supplement or enhance management, analysts and investors' overall understanding of our underlying financial performance and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods. for example, non-gaap earnings and eps information is an indication of our baseline performance before items that are considered by us to not be reflective of our ongoing results. in addition, this information is among the primary indicators that we use as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets and planning and forecasting for future periods. this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted eps prepared in accordance with gaap and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted. we encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

liquidity and capital resources we regularly assess our anticipated working capital needs, debt and leverage levels, debt maturities, capital expenditure requirements, dividend payouts, potential share repurchases and future investments or acquisitions in order to maximize shareholder return, efficiently finance our ongoing operations and maintain flexibility for future strategic transactions. we also regularly evaluate our capital structure to ensure financial risks, adequate liquidity access and lower cost of capital are efficiently managed, which may lead to the issuance of additional debt securities, the repurchase of debt securities prior to maturity or the issuance or repurchase of common stock. we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities together with cash generated from operations and, if required, from the issuance of commercial paper will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for at least the next few years, including dividends, capital expenditures, milestone payments, working capital, restructuring initiatives, business development, repurchase of common stock, debt maturities of approximately $15.1 billion through 2025 as well as any debt repurchases through redemptions or tender offers.
we have a share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors allowing for repurchases of our shares. the specific timing and number of shares repurchased will be determined by our management at its discretion and will vary based on market conditions, securities law limitations and other factors. the share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares, does not have a specific expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. the repurchases may be effected through a combination of one or more open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, transactions structured through investment banking institutions and other derivative transactions, relying on rule 10b-18 and rule 10b5-1 under the exchange act. the outstanding share repurchase authorization under the program was $4.4 billion as of december 31, 2020. our board of directors approved an increase to the share repurchase authorization of our common stock of $2.0 billion in january 2021 and $15.0 billion in december 2021. we repurchased approximately 102 million shares of our common stock for $6.2 billion in 2021. the remaining share repurchase capacity under the share repurchase program was approximately $15.2 billion as of december 31, 2021. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 16. equity" for additional information.
in february 2022, we executed accelerated share repurchase ("asr") agreements to repurchase an aggregate $5.0 billion of our common stock. these asr agreements were funded with cash on-hand and are expected to settle during the second and third quarters of 2022. the total number of shares to be repurchased under the asr agreements will be based on volume-weighted average prices of our common stock during the terms of the asr transactions less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the asr agreements..
under our commercial paper program, we may issue a maximum of $5 billion unsecured notes that have maturities of not more than 366 days from the date of issuance. there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of december 31, 2021.
in 2021, we purchased an aggregate principal amount of $3.5 billion of certain debt securities for approximately $4.0 billion of cash in a series of tender offers and "make whole" redemptions and $2.0 billion of notes matured and were repaid.
at december 31, 2021, we had four separate revolving credit facilities totaling $6.0 billion, which consisted of a 364-day $2.0 billion facility which expired in january 2022, a three-year $1.0 billion facility which expired in january 2022 and two five-year $1.5 billion facilities that were extended to september 2025 and july 2026, respectively. no borrowings were outstanding under any revolving credit facility at december 31, 2021 or 2020.
in january 2022, we entered into a five-year $5.0 billion facility expiring in january 2027, which is extendable annually by one year with the consent of the lenders. this facility provides for customary terms and conditions with no financial covenants and may be used to provide backup liquidity for our commercial paper borrowings. concurrently with the entry into this facility, the commitments under our existing five-year $1.5 billion facilities were terminated and the three-year $1.0 billion facility and 364-day $2.0 billion facility expired in accordance with their terms in january 2022.
our investment portfolio includes marketable debt securities, which are subject to changes in fair value as a result of interest rate fluctuations and other market factors. our investment policy establishes limits on the amount and time to maturity of investments with any institution. the policy also requires that investments are only entered into with corporate and financial institutions that meet high credit quality standards. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 9. financial instruments and fair value measurements" for further information.
capital expenditures annual capital expenditures were approximately $970 million in 2021, $750 million in 2020 and $800 million in 2019 and are expected to be approximately $1.2 billion in both 2022 and 2023. we continue to make capital expenditures in connection with the expansion of our cell therapy and other manufacturing capabilities, research and development and other facility-related activities.
contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future. information regarding our obligations relating to debt, income taxes and lease arrangements are provided in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 7. income taxes", "-note 9. financial instruments and fair value measurements" and "-note 13. leases", respectively.
we are committed to an aggregate $21.1 billion of potential contingent future research and development milestone payments to third parties for in-licensing, asset acquisitions and development programs including early-stage milestones of $7.4 billion (milestones achieved through phase iii clinical studies) and late-stage milestones of $13.7 billion (milestones achieved post phase iii clinical studies). payments generally are due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental and regulatory milestones for which the specific timing cannot be predicted. certain agreements also provide for sales-based milestones aggregating to $15.0 billion that we would be obligated to pay upon achievement of certain sales levels in addition to royalties. we also have certain manufacturing, development and commercialization obligations in connection with alliance arrangements. it is not practicable to estimate the amount of these obligations. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 3. alliances" for further information regarding our alliances.
we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our financial condition or results of operations.
credit ratings our current long-term and short-term credit ratings assigned by moody's investors service are a2 and prime-1, respectively, with a stable long-term credit outlook, and our current long-term and short-term credit ratings assigned by standard & poor's are a+ and a-1, respectively with a negative long-term credit outlook. the long-term ratings reflect the agencies' opinion that we have a low default risk but are somewhat susceptible to adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions. the short-term ratings reflect the agencies' opinion that we have good to extremely strong capacity for timely repayment. any credit rating downgrade may affect the interest rate of any debt we may incur, the fair market value of existing debt and our ability to access the capital markets generally.
cash flows the following is a discussion of cash flow activities:
operating activities                       $16,207                           $14,052
investing activities                         (538)                          (10,859)
financing activities                      (16,224)                           (1,151)
operating activities cash flow from operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements from all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. operating cash flow is derived by adjusting net earnings for noncontrolling interest, non-cash operating items, gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities and changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting from timing differences between the receipts and payments of cash and when the transactions are recognized in our results of operations. as a result, changes in cash from operating activities reflect the timing of cash collections from customers and alliance partners; payments to suppliers, alliance partners and employees; customer discounts and rebates; and tax payments in the ordinary course of business.
the $2.2 billion change in cash flow from operating activities compared to 2020 was primarily due to higher cash collections and timing of payments in the ordinary course of business, lower celgene restructuring and integration payments ($400 million) and cash settlement of myokardia unvested stock awards in 2020 ($500 million), partially offset by reversion of post-retirement plan assets ($300 million) in 2020.
investing activities cash requirements from investing activities include cash used for acquisitions, manufacturing and facility-related capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities with original maturities greater than 90 days at the time of purchase, proceeds from business divestitures (including royalties), the sale and maturity of marketable securities, sale of equity investments and upfront and contingent milestones from licensing arrangements.
the $10.3 billion change in cash flow from investing activities compared to 2020 was due to lower licensing and asset acquisition payments of $11.5 billion primarily resulting from the myokardia acquisition in 2020 and higher proceeds from sales of equity investments of approximately $2.4 billion in 2021, partially offset by changes in the amount of marketable debt securities held of $3.4 billion.
financing activities cash requirements from financing activities include cash used to pay dividends, repurchase common stock and repay long-term debt and other borrowings reduced by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of long-term debt and other borrowings.
the $15.1 billion change in cash flow from financing activities compared to 2020 was primarily due to debt issuances of approximately $7.0 billion to partially fund the myokardia acquisition in 2020, higher debt repayments of $3.3 billion, including a series of tender offer and "make whole" redemptions, and higher share repurchases of $4.7 billion in 2021.
sec consent order as previously disclosed, on august 4, 2004, we entered into a final settlement with the sec, concluding an investigation concerning certain wholesaler inventory and accounting matters. the settlement was reached through a consent, a copy of which was attached as exhibit 10 to our quarterly report on form 10-q for the period ended september 30, 2004.
under the terms of the consent, we agreed, subject to certain defined exceptions, to limit sales of all products sold to our direct customers (including wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, retail outlets, pharmacies and government purchasers) based on expected demand or on amounts that do not exceed approximately one month of inventory on hand, without making a timely public disclosure of any change in practice. we also agreed in the consent to certain measures that we have implemented including: (a) establishing a formal review and certification process of our annual and quarterly reports filed with the sec; (b) establishing a business risk and disclosure group; (c) retaining an outside consultant to comprehensively study and help re-engineer our accounting and financial reporting processes; (d) publicly disclosing any sales incentives offered to direct customers for the purpose of inducing them to purchase products in excess of expected demand; and (e) ensuring that our budget process gives appropriate weight to inputs that come from the bottom to the top, and not just from the top to the bottom, and adequately documenting that process.
we have established a company-wide policy concerning our sales to direct customers for the purpose of complying with the consent, which includes the adoption of various procedures to monitor and limit sales to direct customers in accordance with the terms of the consent. these procedures include a governance process to escalate to appropriate management levels potential questions or concerns regarding compliance with the policy and timely resolution of such questions or concerns. in addition, compliance with the policy is monitored on a regular basis.
we maintain dsas with our u.s. pharmaceutical wholesalers, which account for nearly 100% of our gross u.s. revenues. under the current terms of the dsas, our wholesaler customers provide us with weekly information with respect to months on hand product-level inventories and the amount of out-movement of products. the three largest wholesalers currently account for approximately 76% of our gross u.s. revenues. the inventory information received from our wholesalers, together with our internal information, is used to estimate months on hand product level inventories at these wholesalers. we estimate months on hand product inventory levels for our u.s. business's wholesaler customers other than the three largest wholesalers by extrapolating from the months on hand calculated for the three largest wholesalers. in contrast, our non-u.s. business has significantly more direct customers, limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information, where available, varies widely. accordingly, we rely on a variety of methods to estimate months on hand product level inventories for these business units.
we believe the above-described procedures provide a reasonable basis to ensure compliance with the consent.
recently issued accounting standards for recently issued accounting standards, refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 1. accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards."
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. our critical accounting policies are those that significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. because of this uncertainty, actual results may vary from these estimates.
revenue recognition our accounting policy for revenue recognition has a substantial impact on reported results and relies on certain estimates. revenue is recognized following a five-step model: (i) identify the customer contract; (ii) identify the contract's performance obligation; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation; and (v) recognize revenue when or as a performance obligation is satisfied. revenue is also reduced for gtn sales adjustments discussed below, all of which involve significant estimates and judgment after considering legal interpretations of applicable laws and regulations, historical experience, payer channel mix (e.g. medicare or medicaid), current contract prices under applicable programs, unbilled claims and processing time lags and inventory levels in the distribution channel. estimates are assessed each period and adjusted as required to revise information or actual experience.
the following categories of gtn adjustments involve significant estimates, judgments and information obtained from external sources. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 2. revenue" for further discussion and analysis of each significant category of gtn sales adjustments.
charge-backs and cash discounts our u.s. business participates in programs with government entities, the most significant of which are the u.s. department of defense and the u.s. department of veterans affairs, and other parties, including covered entities under the 340b drug pricing program, whereby pricing on products is extended below wholesaler list price to participating entities. these entities purchase products through wholesalers at the lower program price and the wholesalers then charge us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower program price. accounts receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of unprocessed charge-back claims attributable to a sale (typically within a two to four week time lag).
in the u.s. and certain other countries, customers are offered cash discounts as an incentive for prompt payment, generally approximating 2% of the invoiced sales price. accounts receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of cash discount at the time of sale and the discount is typically taken by the customer within one month.
medicaid and medicare rebates our u.s. business participates in state government medicaid programs and other qualifying federal and state government programs requiring discounts and rebates to participating state and local government entities. all discounts and rebates provided through these programs are included in our medicaid rebate accrual. medicaid rebates have also been extended to drugs used in managed medicaid plans. the estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates is presented as a liability.
rebates and discounts are offered to managed healthcare organizations in the u.s. managing prescription drug programs and medicare advantage prescription drug plans covering the medicare part d drug benefit. we also pay a 70% point of service discount to the cms when the medicare part d beneficiaries are in the coverage gap. the estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates and discounts is presented as a liability.
other rebates, returns, discounts and adjustments other gtn sales adjustments include sales returns and all other programs based on applicable laws and regulations for individual non-u.s. countries as well as rebates offered to managed healthcare organizations in the u.s. to a lesser extent. the non-u.s. programs include several different pricing schemes such as cost caps, volume discounts, outcome-based pricing schemes and pricing claw-backs that are based on sales of individual companies or an aggregation of all companies participating in a specific market. the estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates and discounts is presented as a liability.
estimated returns for established products are determined after considering historical experience and other factors including levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product recalls, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, introductions of generic products, introductions of competitive new products and lower demand following the loss of market exclusivity. estimated returns for new products are determined after considering historical sales return experience of similar products, such as those within the same product line, similar therapeutic area and/or similar distribution model and estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and projected demand. the estimated amount for product returns is presented as a liability.
use of information from external sources information from external sources is used to estimate gtn adjustments. our estimate of inventory at the wholesalers is based on the projected prescription demand-based sales for our products and historical inventory experience, as well as our analysis of third-party information, including written and oral information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and sell-through to customers and third-party market research data, and our internal information. the inventory information received from wholesalers is a product of their recordkeeping process and excludes inventory held by intermediaries to whom they sell, such as retailers and hospitals.
we have also continued the practice of combining retail and mail prescription volume on a retail-equivalent basis. we use this methodology for internal demand forecasts. we also use information from external sources to identify prescription trends, patient demand and average selling prices. our estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third-party information, as certain third-party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations including lags between the date as of which third-party information is generated and the date on which we receive third-party information.
long-lived assets intangible assets valuations a significant amount of the purchase price for the celgene acquisition was allocated to intangible assets, including acquired marketed product rights and iprd assets. our intangible assets were $42.5 billion as of december 31, 2021 and $53.2 billion as of december 31, 2020.
identifiable intangible assets are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. we engaged an independent third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date. the fair value of these assets were estimated using discounted cash flow models. these models required the use of the following significant estimates and assumptions among others:
•identification of product candidates with sufficient substance requiring separate recognition;
•estimates of revenues and operating profits related to commercial products or product candidates;
•eligible patients, pricing and market share used in estimating future revenues;
•probability of success for unapproved product candidates and additional indications for commercial products;
•resources required to complete the development and approval of product candidates;
•timing of regulatory approvals and exclusivity;
•market participant income tax rates; and
•allocation of expected synergies to products.
we believe the estimated and preliminary fair value assigned to intangible assets acquired used reasonable estimates and assumptions considering the facts and circumstances as of the acquisition date.
impairment and amortization of long-lived assets, including intangible assets long-lived assets include intangible assets and property, plant and equipment and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable or at least annually for iprd. intangible assets are highly vulnerable to impairment charges, particularly newly acquired assets for recently launched products or iprd. these assets are initially measured at fair value and therefore any reduction in expectations used in the valuations could potentially lead to impairment. some of the more common potential risks leading to impairment include changes in competitive landscape, earlier than expected loss of market exclusivity, pricing reductions, adverse regulatory changes or clinical study results, delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval for initial or follow on indications and unanticipated development costs, inability to achieve expected synergies resulting from cost savings and avoidance, higher operating costs, changes in tax laws and other macro-economic changes. the complexity in estimating the fair value of intangible assets in connection with an impairment test is similar to the initial valuation. if the carrying value of long-lived assets exceeds its fair value, then the asset is written-down to its fair value. expectations of future cash flows are subject to change based upon the near and long-term production volumes and margins generated by the asset as well as any potential alternative future use. the estimated useful lives of long-lived assets is subjective and requires significant judgment regarding patent lives, future plans and external market factors. long-lived assets are also periodically reviewed for changes in facts or circumstances resulting in a reduction to the estimated useful life of the asset, requiring the acceleration of depreciation or amortization. in 2021, an impairment charge of $315 million was recognized in cost of products sold as the carrying value of inrebic eu regulatory approval milestones exceeded the projected undiscounted cash flows of the assets. additionally, impairment charges of $840 million were recorded in research and development expense relating to two iprd assets. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 14. goodwill and other intangible assets" for further discussion and analysis of these impairment charges.
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired in a business combination. goodwill was $20.5 billion as of december 31, 2021 and 2020.
we assess the goodwill balance within our single reporting unit annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable to determine whether any impairment in this asset may exist and, if so, the extent of such impairment. goodwill is reviewed for impairment by assessing qualitative factors, including comparing our market capitalization to the carrying value of our assets. events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts.
income taxes valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. the assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including long-range forecasts of future taxable income and evaluation of tax planning initiatives. adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made. our deferred tax assets were $2.7 billion at december 31, 2021 (net of valuation allowances of $1.1 billion) and $3.5 billion at december 31, 2020 (net of valuation allowances of $2.8 billion).
the u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards were $585 million at december 31, 2021. these carryforwards were acquired as a result of certain acquisitions and are subject to limitations under section 382 of the internal revenue code. the net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2022. the foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2021 (certain amounts have unlimited lives).
prior to the mead johnson split-off in 2009, the following transactions occurred: (i) an internal spin-off of mead johnson shares while still owned by us; (ii) conversion of mead johnson class b shares to class a shares; and (iii) conversion of mead johnson & company to a limited liability company. these transactions as well as the split-off of mead johnson through the exchange offer should qualify as tax-exempt transactions under the internal revenue code based upon a private letter ruling received from the internal revenue service related to the conversion of mead johnson class b shares to class a shares, and outside legal opinions.
certain assumptions, representations and covenants by mead johnson were relied upon regarding the future conduct of its business and other matters which could affect the tax treatment of the exchange. for example, the current tax law generally creates a presumption that the exchange would be taxable to us, if mead johnson or its shareholders were to engage in transactions that result in a 50% or greater change in its stock ownership during a four year period beginning two years before the exchange offer, unless it is established that the exchange offer were not part of a plan or series of related transactions to effect such a change in ownership. if the internal spin-off or exchange offer were determined not to qualify as a tax exempt transaction, the transaction could be subject to tax as if the exchange was a taxable sale by us at market value.
in addition, a negative basis or excess loss account ("ela") existed in our investment in stock of mead johnson prior to these transactions. we received an opinion from outside legal counsel to the effect that it is more likely than not that we eliminated the ela as part of these transactions and do not have taxable income with respect to the ela. the tax law in this area is complex and it is possible that even if the internal spin-off and the exchange offer is tax exempt under the internal revenue code, the internal revenue service could assert that we have additional taxable income for the period with respect to the ela. we could be exposed to additional taxes if this were to occur. based upon our understanding of the internal revenue code and opinion from outside legal counsel, a tax reserve of $244 million was established reducing the gain on disposal of mead johnson included in discontinued operations in 2009.
we agreed to certain tax related indemnities with mead johnson as set forth in the tax sharing agreement, including certain taxes related to its business prior to the completion of the initial public offering and created as part of the restructuring to facilitate the ipo. mead johnson has also agreed to indemnify us for potential tax effects resulting from the breach of certain representations discussed above as well as certain transactions related to the acquisition of mead johnson's stock or assets.
liabilities are established for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known tax exposures including, but not limited to, transfer pricing matters, tax credits and deductibility of certain expenses. such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid and may need to be adjusted over time as more information becomes known.
for discussions on income taxes, refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 1. accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards-income taxes" and "-note 7. income taxes."
contingencies in the normal course of business, we are subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others, government investigations, shareholder lawsuits, product and environmental liability, contractual claims and tax matters. we recognize accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. these estimates are subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, as such, actual results could vary from these estimates.

product and pipeline developments our r&d programs are managed on a portfolio basis from early discovery through late-stage development and include a balance of early-stage and late-stage programs to support future growth. our late stage r&d programs in phase iii development include both investigational compounds for initial indications and additional indications or formulations for marketed products. spending on these programs represent approximately 40% of our annual r&d expenses in the last three years. opdivo was the only investigational compound or marketed product that represented greater than 10% of our r&d expenses in the last three years. our late-stage development programs could potentially have an impact on our revenue and earnings within the next few years if regulatory approvals are obtained and products are successfully commercialized. the following are the developments in our marketed products and our late-stage pipeline:

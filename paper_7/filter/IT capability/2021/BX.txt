our business blackstone is one of the world's leading investment firms. our business is organized into four segments: real estate, private equity, hedge fund solutions and credit & insurance. for more information about our business segments, see "part i. item 1. business - business segments."
we generate revenue from fees earned pursuant to contractual arrangements with funds, fund investors and fund portfolio companies (including management, transaction and monitoring fees), and from capital markets services. we also invest in the funds we manage and we are entitled to a pro-rata share of the results of the fund (a "pro-rata allocation"). in addition to a pro-rata allocation, and assuming certain investment returns are achieved, we are entitled to a disproportionate allocation of the income otherwise allocable to the limited partners, commonly referred to as carried interest ("performance allocations"). in certain structures, we receive a contractual incentive fee from an investment fund in the event that specified cumulative investment returns are achieved (an "incentive fee," and together with performance allocations, "performance revenues"). the composition of our revenues will vary based on market conditions and the cyclicality of the different businesses in which we operate. net investment gains and investment income generated by the blackstone funds are driven by value created by our operating and strategic initiatives as well as overall market conditions. fair values are affected by changes in the fundamentals of our portfolio company and other investments, the industries in which they operate, the overall economy and other market conditions.
our response to covid-19
our primary focus during the covid-19 pandemic has been the safety and wellbeing of our employees and their families, as well as the seamless functioning of the firm in serving our investors who have entrusted us with their capital, and our shareholders. where remote work has been appropriate or recommended under local government guidelines, our technology infrastructure has proven to be robust and capable of supporting a remote work model and we have implemented rigorous protocols for remote work across the firm, including increased cadence of group calls and updates, and frequent communication across leadership and working levels. we have also leveraged technology to ensure our teams stay connected and productive, and that our culture remains strong. to the extent we have not been meeting with our clients in person, we have continued to actively communicate with them through videoconference, teleconference and email. our investment committees have also continued to convene as needed, and the firm has continued to operate across investment, asset management and corporate support functions. our return to office protocols have been developed and implemented consistent with local government guidelines, with testing, contact-tracing and social distancing and other safety protocols in place, and we continue to closely monitor applicable public health and government guidance and the proliferation of variants.
business environment blackstone's businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in the u.s., europe, asia and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere in the world.
in 2021, economic conditions strongly rebounded from the prior year, particularly in the u.s., which was significantly affected by the covid-19 pandemic in 2020. the bureau of economic analysis' advance estimate of u.s. real gdp growth indicated growth of 5.7% in 2021, after a 3.4% decline in gdp in 2020. this estimate for 2021 would equate to the fastest rate of economic growth in nearly 40 years. at the same time, in december 2021, annual u.s. inflation reached a 39-year high of 7.0%, leading the u.s. federal reserve to indicate a plan to begin to increase interest rates in the near term. despite strong equity market returns overall for 2021, concerns over inflation, higher interest rates and the impact of covid variants on economic growth led to heightened equity market volatility exiting the year, and such volatility continued into early 2022. global supply chains have also continued to be disrupted, particularly given china's recurrent covid restrictions. such disruption has contributed to growing inflationary pressure and may further contribute to slower real gdp growth globally.
the s&p 500 total return index increased 11% in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 29% in 2021, with strong appreciation across sectors, led by energy and real estate. the bloomberg commodity index fell by -1.6% in the fourth quarter but rose more than 27% for the year. the price of west texas intermediate crude oil increased 55% to $75 per barrel for the year.
credit markets also appreciated in 2021, as u.s. leveraged loans and high yield bonds returned 5.2% and 5.4%, respectively. high yield spreads tightened a total of 76 basis points in the year, while issuance increased 15%. merger and acquisition activity accelerated, with global announced deal value increasing 63% in 2021 compared to 2020.
throughout 2021, the u.s. federal reserve maintained the federal funds target range at 0.0%-0.25%, the range set in march 2020 in response to the onset of covid-19. the yield on the ten-year treasury remained relatively flat in the fourth quarter, ending the year at 1.51%, but has risen sharply so far in 2022, to 1.96% as of february 17, 2022. three-month libor increased eight basis points in the fourth quarter to 0.21%, and further to 0.49% as of february 16, 2022. subsequent to the end of 2021, the u.s. federal reserve indicated that it foresees up to three quarter-percentage-point interest rate increases in 2022, beginning as early as march 2022, with continued increases expected in 2023 and 2024.
the u.s. unemployment rate decreased to a post-pandemic low of 3.9% as of december 2021 from 6.7% in december 2020. average hourly earnings in december increased 4.7% year-over-year based on the three-month average for production and nonsupervisory employees. u.s. retail sales increased 18% year-over-year in 2021 on a seasonally adjusted basis. since 2019, personal savings in 2021 increased 88% and disposable personal income increased 14%. the institute for supply management purchasing managers' index decreased in 2021 to 58.7, compared to 60.7 at the end of 2020, signaling moderate expansion in the u.s. manufacturing sector.
countries around the world continue to recover from the economic impacts of the covid-19 pandemic. while economic activity remains robust, global supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and rising commodity prices continue to have a negative impact across sectors and regions, and concerns regarding inflation and increasing interest rates are deepening.

the simplified diagram below depicts our current organizational structure. the diagram does not depict all of our subsidiaries, including intermediate holding companies through which certain of the subsidiaries depicted are held.
key financial measures and indicators we manage our business using certain financial measures and key operating metrics since we believe these metrics measure the productivity of our investment activities. we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"). see "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - note 2. summary of significant accounting policies" and "- critical accounting policies." our key non-gaap financial measures and operating indicators and metrics are discussed below.
distributable earnings distributable earnings is derived from blackstone's segment reported results. distributable earnings is used to assess performance and amounts available for dividends to blackstone shareholders, including blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of the blackstone holdings partnerships. distributable earnings is the sum of segment distributable earnings plus net interest and dividend income (loss) less taxes and related payables. distributable earnings excludes unrealized activity and is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable gaap measure of income (loss) before provision (benefit) for taxes. see "- non-gaap financial measures" for our reconciliation of distributable earnings.
net interest and dividend income (loss) is presented on a segment basis and is equal to interest and dividend revenue less interest expense, adjusted for the impact of consolidation of blackstone funds, and interest expense associated with the tax receivable agreement.
taxes and related payables represent the total gaap tax provision adjusted to include only the current tax provision (benefit) calculated on income (loss) before provision (benefit) for taxes and including the payable under the tax receivable agreement. further, the current tax provision utilized when calculating taxes and related payables and distributable earnings reflects the benefit of deductions available to the company on certain expense items that are excluded from the underlying calculation of segment distributable earnings and total segment distributable earnings, such as equity-based compensation charges and certain transaction-related charges where there is a current tax provision or benefit. the economic assumptions and methodologies that impact the implied income tax provision are the same as those methodologies and assumptions used in calculating the current income tax provision for blackstone's consolidated statements of operations under gaap, excluding the impact of divestitures and accrued tax contingencies and refunds which are reflected when paid or received. management believes that including the amount payable under the tax receivable agreement and utilizing the current income tax provision adjusted as described above when calculating distributable earnings is meaningful as it increases comparability between periods and more accurately reflects earnings that are available for distribution to shareholders.
segment distributable earnings segment distributable earnings is blackstone's segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and assess performance across blackstone's four segments. segment distributable earnings represents the net realized earnings of blackstone's segments and is the sum of fee related earnings and net realizations for each segment. blackstone's segments are presented on a basis that deconsolidates blackstone funds, eliminates non-controlling ownership interests in blackstone's consolidated operating partnerships, removes the amortization of intangible assets and removes transaction-related charges. transaction-related charges arise from corporate actions including acquisitions, divestitures and blackstone's initial public offering. they consist primarily of equity-based compensation charges, gains and losses on contingent consideration arrangements, changes in the balance of the tax receivable agreement resulting from a change in tax law or similar event, transaction costs and any gains or losses associated with these corporate actions. segment distributable earnings excludes unrealized activity and is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable gaap measure of income (loss) before provision (benefit) for taxes. see "- non-gaap financial measures" for our reconciliation of segment distributable earnings.
net realizations is presented on a segment basis and is the sum of realized principal investment income and realized performance revenues (which refers to realized performance revenues excluding fee related performance revenues), less realized performance compensation (which refers to realized performance compensation excluding fee related performance compensation and equity-based performance compensation).
realized performance compensation reflects an increase in the aggregate realized performance compensation paid to certain of our professionals above the amounts allocable to them based upon the percentage participation in the relevant performance plans previously awarded to them as a result of a new compensation program that commenced during the year ended december 31, 2021. as a result, in the year ended december 31, 2021, realized performance compensation paid to our professionals was increased by an aggregate of $19.7 million and fee related compensation was decreased by a corresponding amount. these changes to realized performance compensation and fee related compensation reduced net realizations, increased fee related earnings, and were neutral to income (loss) before provision (benefit) for taxes and had no impact to distributable earnings in the year ended december 31, 2021.
fee related earnings fee related earnings is a performance measure used to assess blackstone's ability to generate profits from revenues that are measured and received on a recurring basis and not subject to future realization events. fee related earnings equals management and advisory fees (net of management fee reductions and offsets) plus fee related performance revenues, less (a) fee related compensation on a segment basis, and (b) other operating expenses. fee related earnings is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable gaap measure of income (loss) before provision (benefit) for taxes. see "- non-gaap financial measures" for our reconciliation of fee related earnings.
fee related compensation is presented on a segment basis and refers to the compensation expense, excluding equity-based compensation, directly related to (a) management and advisory fees, net and (b) fee related performance revenues, referred to as fee related performance compensation.
fee related performance revenues refers to the realized portion of performance revenues from perpetual capital that are (a) measured and received on a recurring basis, and (b) not dependent on realization events from the underlying investments.
other operating expenses is presented on a segment basis and is equal to general, administrative and other expenses, adjusted to (a) remove the amortization of transaction-related intangibles, (b) remove certain expenses reimbursed by the blackstone funds which are netted against management and advisory fees, net in blackstone's segment presentation, and (c) give effect to an administrative fee collected on a quarterly basis from certain holders of blackstone holdings partnership units. the administrative fee is accounted for as a capital contribution under gaap, but is reflected as a reduction of other operating expenses in blackstone's segment presentation.
adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization ("adjusted ebitda"), is a supplemental measure used to assess performance derived from blackstone's segment results and may be used to assess its ability to service its borrowings. adjusted ebitda represents distributable earnings plus the addition of (a) interest expense on a segment basis, (b) taxes and related payables, and (c) depreciation and amortization. adjusted ebitda is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable gaap measure of income (loss) before provision (benefit) for taxes. see "- non-gaap financial measures" for our reconciliation of adjusted ebitda.
net accrued performance revenues net accrued performance revenues is a financial measure used as an indicator of potential future realized performance revenues based on the current investment portfolio of the funds and vehicles we manage. net accrued performance revenues represents the accrued performance revenues receivable by blackstone, net of the related accrued performance compensation payable by blackstone, excluding performance revenues that have been realized but not yet distributed as of the reporting date and clawback amounts, if any. net accrued performance revenues is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable gaap measure of investments. see "- non-gaap financial measures" for our reconciliation of net accrued performance revenues and note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies - equity method investments" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data." for additional information on the calculation of investments - accrued performance allocations.
operating metrics the alternative asset management business is primarily based on managing third party capital and does not require substantial capital investment to support rapid growth. since our inception, we have developed and used various key operating metrics to assess and monitor the operating performance of our various alternative asset management businesses in order to monitor the effectiveness of our value creating strategies.
total and fee-earning assets under management total assets under management refers to the assets we manage. our total assets under management equals the sum of:
(a)   the fair value of the investments held by our carry funds and our side-by-side and co-investment entities managed by us plus the capital that we are entitled to call from investors in those funds and entities pursuant to the terms of their respective capital commitments, including capital commitments to funds that have yet to commence their investment periods,
(b)   the net asset value of (1) our hedge funds, real estate debt carry funds, bpp, certain co-investments managed by us, certain credit-focused funds, and our hedge fund solutions drawdown funds (plus, in each case, the capital that we are entitled to call from investors in those funds, including commitments yet to commence their investment periods), and (2) our funds of hedge funds, our hedge fund solutions registered investment companies, breit, and bepif,
(c)   the invested capital, fair value or net asset value of assets we manage pursuant to separately managed accounts,
(d)   the amount of debt and equity outstanding for our clos during the reinvestment period,
(e)   the aggregate par amount of collateral assets, including principal cash, for our clos after the reinvestment period,
(f)   the gross or net amount of assets (including leverage where applicable) for our credit-focused registered investment companies,
(g)   the fair value of common stock, preferred stock, convertible debt, term loans or similar instruments issued by bxmt, and
(h)   borrowings under and any amounts available to be borrowed under certain credit facilities of our funds.
our carry funds are commitment-based drawdown structured funds that do not permit investors to redeem their interests at their election. our funds of hedge funds, hedge funds, funds structured like hedge funds and other open-ended funds in our real estate, hedge fund solutions and credit & insurance segments generally have structures that afford an investor the right to withdraw or redeem their interests on a periodic basis (for example, annually or quarterly), typically with 30 to 95 days' notice, depending on the fund and the liquidity profile of the underlying assets. in our perpetual capital vehicles where redemption rights exist, blackstone has the ability to fulfill redemption requests only (a) in blackstone's or the vehicles' board's discretion, as applicable, or (b) to the extent there is sufficient new capital. investment advisory agreements related to certain separately managed accounts in our hedge fund solutions and credit & insurance segments, excluding our bis separately managed accounts, may generally be terminated by an investor on 30 to 90 days' notice. our bis separately managed accounts can generally only be terminated for long-term underperformance, cause and certain other limited circumstances, in each case subject to blackstone's right to cure.
fee-earning assets under management refers to the assets we manage on which we derive management fees and/or performance revenues. our fee-earning assets under management equals the sum of:
(a)   for our private equity segment funds and real estate segment carry funds, including certain breds and hedge fund solutions funds, the amount of capital commitments, remaining invested capital, fair value, net asset value or par value of assets held, depending on the fee terms of the fund,
(b)   for our credit-focused carry funds, the amount of remaining invested capital (which may include leverage) or net asset value, depending on the fee terms of the fund,
(c)   the remaining invested capital or fair value of assets held in co-investment vehicles managed by us on which we receive fees,
(d)   the net asset value of our funds of hedge funds, hedge funds, bpp, certain co-investments managed by us, certain registered investment companies, breit, and certain of our hedge fund solutions drawdown funds,
(e)   the invested capital, fair value of assets or the net asset value we manage pursuant to separately managed accounts,
(f)   the net proceeds received from equity offerings and accumulated distributable earnings of bxmt, subject to certain adjustments,
(g)   the aggregate par amount of collateral assets, including principal cash, of our clos, and
(h)   the gross amount of assets (including leverage) or the net assets (plus leverage where applicable) for certain of our credit-focused registered investment companies.
each of our segments may include certain fee-earning assets under management on which we earn performance revenues but not management fees.
our calculations of total assets under management and fee-earning assets under management may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. in addition, our calculation of total assets under management includes commitments to, and the fair value of, invested capital in our funds from blackstone and our personnel, regardless of whether such commitments or invested capital are subject to fees. our definitions of total assets under management and fee-earning assets under management are not based on any definition of total assets under management and fee-earning assets under management that is set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds that we manage.
for our carry funds, total assets under management includes the fair value of the investments held and uncalled capital commitments, whereas fee-earning assets under management may include the total amount of capital commitments or the remaining amount of invested capital at cost depending on whether the investment period has expired or as specified by the fee terms of the fund. as such, in certain carry funds fee-earning assets under management may be greater than total assets under management when the aggregate fair value of the remaining investments is less than the cost of those investments.
perpetual capital perpetual capital refers to the component of assets under management with an indefinite term, that is not in liquidation, and for which there is no requirement to return capital to investors through redemption requests in the ordinary course of business, except where funded by new capital inflows. perpetual capital includes co-investment capital with an investor right to convert into perpetual capital.
dry powder dry powder represents the amount of capital available for investment or reinvestment, including general partner and employee capital, and is an indicator of the capital we have available for future investments.
performance eligible assets under management performance eligible assets under management represents invested and to be invested capital at fair value, including capital closed for funds whose investment period has not yet commenced, on which performance revenues could be earned if certain hurdles are met.

revenues revenues were $22.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $16.5 billion, or 270%, compared to $6.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an increase of $14.8 billion in investment income (loss), which is composed of increases of $10.6 billion and $4.2 billion in unrealized and realized investment income (loss), respectively.
the $10.6 billion increase in unrealized investment income (loss) was primarily attributable to net unrealized appreciation of investment holdings in the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to net unrealized depreciation of investment holdings in the year ended december 31, 2020 in each of our segments. principal drivers of these increases were:
•   the increase of $5.2 billion in our real estate segment was primarily attributable to higher net unrealized appreciation of investment holdings in our brep and core+ real estate funds in the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. the carrying value of investments for brep funds increased 43.8% for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to 3.4% for the year ended december 31, 2020. the carrying value of investments for core+ real estate increased 25.0% for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to 7.9% for the year ended december 31, 2020.
•   the increase of $3.7 billion in our private equity segment was primarily attributable to higher net unrealized appreciation of investment holdings in corporate private equity, strategic partners and tactical opportunities in the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. corporate private equity, strategic partners and tactical opportunities carrying value increased 42.2%, 61.2% and 34.9%, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to 11.9%, 0.1% and 14.1%, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2020.
effective september 30, 2021, strategic partners' fund financial reporting process was updated. as a result, the increase in strategic partners' carrying value for the year ended december 31, 2021 includes the economic and market activity of five quarters. if the updated strategic partners' fund financial reporting process had been in place in prior periods, strategic partners' carrying value would have increased 49.8% for the year ended december 31, 2021. see note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies - equity method investments" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" for additional information.
•   the increase of $517.9 million in our credit &amp; insurance segment was primarily attributable to net unrealized appreciation of investments in our private credit strategies in the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to net unrealized depreciation in the year ended december 31, 2020.
•   the increase of $461.6 million in our hedge fund solutions segment was primarily attributable to net unrealized appreciation of investment holdings in individual investor and specialized solutions, customized solutions and commingled products.
the $4.2 billion increase in realized investment income (loss) was primarily attributable to higher realized gains in our private equity and real estate segments and the gain recognized in connection with the pátria sale transactions in the first and third quarter of 2021. for additional information, see note 4. "investments - equity method investments" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
expenses expenses were $9.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $6.0 billion, compared to $3.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $5.8 billion in total compensation and benefits, of which $5.4 billion was performance allocations compensation. the increase in performance allocations compensation was primarily due to the increase in investment income (loss) - performance allocations, on which a portion of this compensation is based.
other income (loss) was $458.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $463.7 million, compared to $(4.8) million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in other income (loss) was due to increases of $431.1 million in net gains (losses) from fund investment activities and $32.6 million in change in tax receivable agreement liability.
the increase in net gains (losses) from fund investment activities was principally driven by increases of $206.0 million, $205.6 million and $31.2 million in our real estate, private equity and credit & insurance segments, respectively. the increase in our real estate and private equity segments was primarily due to unrealized appreciation and realized net gains of investments in our consolidated real estate and private equity funds, as applicable. the increase in our credit & insurance segment was primarily driven by the deconsolidation of nine clo vehicles during the year ended december 31, 2020, as well as realized net gains of investments, partially offset by unrealized depreciation of investments, in our consolidated credit funds. see note 9. "variable interest entities" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" for additional information on the deconsolidated clo vehicles.
the increase in change in tax receivable agreement liability was due to changes in estimated tax basis recovery.
provision (benefit) for taxes the following table summarizes blackstone's tax position:

(a)   effective june 30, 2021, blackstone recategorized certain components of its effective income tax reconciliation. accordingly, certain components related to income attributable to non-controlling interest holders were recategorized from income passed through to non-controlling interest holders to other. prior periods have been recast accordingly. the recategorization had no effect on blackstone's provision for taxes.
(b)   includes income that was not taxable to blackstone and its subsidiaries. such income was directly taxable to shareholders of blackstone's common stock for the period prior to the conversion and remains taxable to blackstone's non-controlling interest holders.
(c)   the change in valuation allowance for the year ended december 31, 2019 represents the change from july 1, 2019 to december 31, 2019, following the change to a taxable corporation.
blackstone's provision (benefit) for taxes for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020 was $1.2 billion and $356.0 million, respectively. this resulted in an effective tax rate of 8.7% and 13.6%, respectively, based on our income before provision (benefit) for taxes of $13.6 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively.
the decrease in blackstone's effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2021, compared to the year ended december 31, 2020, resulted primarily from the conversion, state taxes and valuation allowance releases related to the step-up in the tax basis of investment assets.
additional information regarding our income taxes can be found in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - note 15. income taxes" of this filing.
non-controlling interests in consolidated entities the net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests in consolidated entities and net income attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated entities is attributable to the consolidated blackstone funds. the amounts of these items vary directly with the performance of the consolidated blackstone funds and largely eliminate the amount of other income (loss) - net gains (losses) from fund investment activities from the net income (loss) attributable to blackstone inc.
net income attributable to non-controlling interests in blackstone holdings is derived from the income before provision (benefit) for taxes at the blackstone holdings level, excluding the net gains (losses) from fund investment activities and the percentage allocation of the income between blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of blackstone holdings and blackstone after considering any contractual arrangements that govern the allocation of income such as fees allocable to blackstone.
for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, the net income before taxes allocated to blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of blackstone holdings was 41.3% and 42.7%, respectively. the decrease of 1.4% was primarily due to the conversion of blackstone holdings partnership units to shares of common stock and the vesting of shares of common stock.
the other income (loss) - change in tax receivable agreement liability was entirely allocated to blackstone inc.

fee-earning assets under management fee-earning assets under management were $650.0 billion at december 31, 2021, an increase of $180.5 billion, or 38%, compared to $469.4 billion at december 31, 2020. the net increase was due to:
o   $103.3 billion in our credit &amp; insurance segment driven by $34.5 billion from certain liquid credit strategies, $23.4 billion from direct lending, $13.8 billion from private placements credit, $12.3 billion from asset-based lending funds, $9.4 billion from clos, $6.0 billion from bis, $1.7 billion from mezzanine funds and $1.1 billion from energy strategies, o   $73.1 billion in our real estate segment driven by $36.4 billion from breds related to everlake and aig l&amp;r and capital being deployed, $26.7 billion from breit, $6.6 billion from bpp and co-investment, $2.4 billion from bpp life sciences, and $818.1 million from brep and co-investment, o   $37.5 billion in our private equity segment driven by $15.8 billion from strategic partners, $10.2 billion from corporate private equity, $5.9 billion from tactical opportunities, $3.9 billion from bip and $1.5 billion from bxg, and inflows for bis exclude inflows related to everlake and aig l&r that were allocated to strategies across various segments. fee-earning assets under management inflows in breds funds exceed the total assets under management inflows due to the inflows being reflected in prior periods at the time of each capital closing of the fund for total assets under management.
•   market activity of $31.2 billion primarily attributable to:
o   $16.6 billion of market appreciation in our real estate segment driven by appreciation of $17.0 billion from core+ real estate (which included $1.2 billion of foreign exchange depreciation), partially offset by foreign exchange depreciation of $873.1 million from brep and co-investment, o   $6.4 billion of market appreciation in our private equity segment driven by $4.3 billion from strategic partners and $2.2 billion from bip.
for additional information regarding the update to strategic partners' fund financial reporting process, see note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies - equity method investments" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this filing.
o   $5.5 billion of market appreciation in our hedge fund solutions segment driven by returns from baam's principal solutions composite of 8.1% gross (7.2% net), and o   $2.7 billion of market appreciation in our credit &amp; insurance segment driven by appreciation of $2.3 billion from mlp strategies, $857.1 million from direct lending and $322.5 million from certain liquid credit strategies, partially offset by market depreciation of $783.5 million from clos, all of which included $1.1 billion of foreign exchange depreciation across the segment.
o   $14.2 billion in our real estate segment driven by $6.2 billion from breds, $4.5 billion from core+ real estate and $3.4 billion from brep and co-investment, o   $13.2 billion in our private equity segment driven by $4.7 billion from strategic partners, $4.5 billion from corporate private equity and $3.3 billion from tactical opportunities, and o   $12.8 billion in our credit &amp; insurance segment driven by $3.9 billion from clos, $3.4 billion from direct lending, $1.9 billion from mezzanine funds, $1.6 billion from stressed/distressed strategies and $1.2 billion from energy strategies.
fee-earning assets under management realizations in our breds funds exceed the total assets under management realizations due to reductions in breds iv's fee basis as a result of third party financing during the period.
o   $11.9 billion in our credit &amp; insurance segment driven by $5.4 billion from certain liquid credit strategies, $2.7 billion from bis, $1.7 billion from mlp strategies, $494.7 million from clos and $440.7 million from stressed/distressed strategies, o   $3.7 billion in our private equity segment driven by $1.6 billion from tactical opportunities, $928.0 million from corporate private equity and $672.7 million from multi-asset products, and o   $3.1 billion in our real estate segment driven by $1.5 billion from breit, $991.0 million from bpp and co-investment and $555.2 million from breds.
total assets under management total assets under management were $880.9 billion at december 31, 2021, an increase of $262.3 billion, or 42%, compared to $618.6 billion at december 31, 2020. the net increase was due to:
o   $129.4 billion in our credit &amp; insurance segment driven by $47.0 billion from direct lending, $34.3 billion from certain liquid credit strategies, $13.8 billion from private placements credit, $12.3 billion from asset-based lending funds, $9.8 billion from clos, $7.7 billion from bis, and $3.1 billion from mezzanine funds, o   $75.3 billion in our real estate segment driven by $28.4 billion from breds related to everlake and aig l&amp;r, $27.1 billion from breit, $8.5 billion from brep funds, $6.7 billion from bpp and co-investment, and $4.3 billion from bpp life sciences, o   $53.9 billion in our private equity segment driven by $22.0 billion from strategic partners, $12.2 billion from corporate private equity, $8.3 billion from tactical opportunities, $6.7 billion from bip, $2.5 billion from bxg and $1.7 billion from bxls, and inflows for bis exclude inflows related to everlake and aig l&r that were allocated to strategies across various segments. total assets under management inflows may exceed fee-earning assets under management inflows due to the following reasons:
•   for our direct lending funds, total assets under management inflows are reported at their gross value while, for certain funds, fee-earning assets under management are reported as net assets, which is the basis on which we charge fees.
•   for brep, due to the difference between fund closings and the commencement of the investment period. total assets under management inflows are reported at each closing whereas the $6.4 billion will be reflected in fee-earning assets under management inflows when the investment period commences for brep asia iii.
•   for strategic partners, primarily due to funds with a maximum management fee basis of investor commitments and non-fee-paying co-investment capital.
•   market activity of $105.2 billion primarily driven by:
o   $49.6 billion of market appreciation in our private equity segment driven by carrying value increases in corporate private equity, strategic partners, and tactical opportunities of 42.2%, 61.2% and 34.9%, respectively, which includes $1.2 billion of foreign exchange depreciation across the segment, effective september 30, 2021, strategic partners' fund financial reporting process was updated. as a result, the increase in strategic partners' carrying value for the year ended december 31, 2021 includes the economic and market activity of five quarters. if the updated strategic partners' fund financial reporting process had been in place in prior periods, strategic partners' carrying value would have increased 49.8% for the year ended december 31, 2021. see note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies - equity method investments" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" for additional information.
o   $41.7 billion of market appreciation in our real estate segment driven by carrying value increases in brep and core+ real estate of 43.8% and 25.0%, during the year, respectively, which includes $3.2 billion of foreign exchange depreciation across the segment, o   $7.7 billion of market appreciation in our credit &amp; insurance segment driven by appreciation of $2.6 billion from mlp strategies, $2.0 billion from direct lending, $1.4 billion from mezzanine funds, $1.2 billion from energy strategies and $871.9 million from stressed/distressed strategies, partially offset by market depreciation of $772.4 million from clos, all of which included $1.2 billion of foreign exchange depreciation across the segment, and o   $6.2 billion of market appreciation in our hedge fund solutions segment driven by reasons noted above in fee-earning assets under management.
total assets under management market activity in our brep and co-investment funds and our private equity segment generally represents the change in fair value of the investments held and typically exceeds the fee-earning assets under management market activity.
o   $36.6 billion in our private equity segment driven by $17.5 billion from corporate private equity, $9.5 billion from strategic partners and $8.1 billion from tactical opportunities, o   $19.5 billion in our real estate segment driven by $12.5 billion from brep and co-investment, $4.6 billion from core+ real estate and $2.4 billion from breds, and o   $19.5 billion in our credit &amp; insurance segment driven by $6.6 billion from direct lending, $4.0 billion from clos, $3.5 billion from mezzanine funds, $2.4 billion from stressed/distressed strategies and $2.1 billion from energy strategies.
total assets under management realizations in our brep and co-investment funds and our private equity segment generally represents the total proceeds and typically exceeds the fee-earning assets under management realizations which generally represents only the invested capital.
o   $13.4 billion in our credit &amp; insurance segment driven by $5.8 billion from certain liquid credit strategies, $2.7 billion from bis, $1.9 billion from mlp strategies, $1.1 billion from direct lending and $760.5 million from clos, o   $5.1 billion in our real estate segment driven by $2.2 billion from breds, $1.5 billion from breit, $991.2 million from bpp and co-investment and $455.4 million from brep and co-investment, and o   $3.0 billion in our private equity segment driven by $1.2 billion from tactical opportunities, $692.2 million from strategic partners, $379.2 million from multi-asset products and $240.6 million from corporate private equity.

*   represents funds that are currently in their investment period and open-ended funds.
(a)   excludes investment vehicles where blackstone does not earn fees.
(b)   available capital represents total investable capital commitments, including side-by-side, adjusted for certain expenses and expired or recallable capital and may include leverage, less invested capital. this amount is not reduced by outstanding commitments to investments.
(c)   multiple of invested capital ("moic") represents carrying value, before management fees, expenses and performance revenues, divided by invested capital.
(d)   unless otherwise indicated, net internal rate of return ("irr") represents the annualized inception to december 31, 2021 irr on total invested capital based on realized proceeds and unrealized value, as applicable, after management fees, expenses and performance revenues. irrs are calculated using actual timing of limited partner cash flows. initial inception date of cash flows may differ from the investment period beginning date.
(e)   the 8% realized net irr and 8% total net irr exclude investors that opted out of the hilton investment opportunity. overall brep international ii performance reflects a 7% realized net irr and a 7% total net irr.
(f)   brep co-investment represents co-investment capital raised for various brep investments. the net irr reflected is calculated by aggregating each co-investment's realized proceeds and unrealized value, as applicable, after management fees, expenses and performance revenues.
(g)   bpp represents the core+ real estate funds which invest with a more modest risk profile and lower leverage. committed capital and available capital are not regularly reported to investors in our core+ strategy and are not applicable in the context of these funds.
(h)   unrealized investment value reflects breit's net asset value as of december 31, 2021. realized investment value represents breit's cash distributions, net of servicing fees. the breit net return reflects a per share blended return, assuming breit had a single share class, reinvestment of all dividends received during the period, and no upfront selling commission, net of all fees and expenses incurred by breit. these returns are not representative of the returns experienced by any particular investor or share class. inception to date net returns are presented on an annualized basis and are from january 1, 2017. committed capital and available capital are not regularly reported to investors in our core+ strategy and are not applicable in the context of this vehicle.
(j)   blackstone core equity partners is a core private equity strategy which invests with a more modest risk profile and longer hold period than traditional private equity.
(k)   realizations are treated as return of capital until fully recovered and therefore unrealized and realized moics are not applicable. returns are calculated from results that are reported on a three month lag from strategic partners' fund financial statements and therefore do not include the impact of economic and market activities in the current quarter. effective in the three months ended december 31, 2021, the moic calculation was updated to exclude capital called for management fees and expenses from invested capital.
(l)   funds presented represent the flagship credit drawdown funds only. the total credit net irr is the combined irr of the credit drawdown funds presented.
(m)   unrealized investment value reflects bcred's net asset value as of december 31, 2021. realized investment value represents bcred's cash distributions, net of servicing fees. the bcred net return reflects a per share blended return, assuming bcred had a single share class, reinvestment of all dividends received during the period, and no upfront selling commission, net of all fees and expenses incurred by bcred. these returns are not representative of the returns experienced by any particular investor or share class. inception to date net returns are presented on an unannualized basis and are from january 7, 2021. committed capital and available capital are not regularly reported to investors in bcred and are not applicable in the context of this vehicle. does not include bxsl as it is now a publicly traded bdc following its ipo on october 28, 2021.

segment distributable earnings were $3.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $1.5 billion, or 92%, compared to $1.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in segment distributable earnings was attributable to increases of $1.2 billion in fee related earnings and $373.4 million in net realizations.
segment distributable earnings in our real estate segment in 2021 were higher compared to 2020. this was primarily driven by increased fee related earnings due to crystallization of breit performance revenues and growth in fee-earning assets under management in core+ real estate and breds, as well as increased net realizations due to higher realized performance revenues in brep and breds. in 2021, we benefited from meaningful fundraising momentum in our perpetual capital strategies, which represent an increasing percentage of our total assets under management. robust economic activity in the u.s. has supported substantial recovery in investments in our real estate portfolio that were impacted by the covid-19 pandemic, and continued strength in our logistics and u.s. multifamily investments.
acceleration of inflation in the u.s. is likely to continue in the near- to medium-term. higher inflation would potentially negatively impact certain real estate assets, such as those with long-term leases that do not provide for short-term rent increases. our real estate strategies have, however, oriented their portfolios toward investments in sectors and markets where we see opportunities for stronger relative growth, with better insulation from inflation pressure. in the u.s., heightened competition for workers, global supply chain issues and rising input costs have contributed to increasing wages and other inputs, which increasingly pressure profit margins. the valuations of certain investments in our real estate segment, particularly in the hospitality sector, would potentially be negatively impacted if such companies and assets cannot successfully identify and execute on means to mitigate margin pressures. in addition, interest rates are expected to continue to rise in 2022, including in connection with expected rate increase by the u.s. federal reserve. a period of sharply rising interest rates could create downward pressure on the price of certain real estate and increase the cost of debt financing for our real estate businesses and assets. further, rising interest rates may contribute to a period of sustained declines in values in the equity markets and make it more difficult to realize value from our real estate investments.
fee related earnings fee related earnings were $2.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 100%, compared to $1.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in fee related earnings was attributable to increases of $1.4 billion in fee related performance revenues and $413.6 million in management fees, net, partially offset by increases of $543.2 million in fee related compensation and $51.4 million in other operating expenses.
fee related performance revenues were $1.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $1.4 billion, compared to $338.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was primarily due to the crystallization of breit performance revenues.
management fees, net were $2.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $413.6 million, compared to $1.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2020, primarily driven by an increase in base management fees. base management fees increased $341.9 million primarily due to fee-earning assets under management growth in core+ real estate and breds.
fee related compensation was $1.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $543.2 million, compared to $618.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was primarily due to increases in fee related performance revenues and management fees, net, on which a portion of fee related compensation is based.
other operating expenses were $234.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $51.4 million, compared to $183.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was primarily due to occupancy and technology related expenses.
net realizations net realizations were $873.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $373.4 million, or 75%, compared to $499.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in net realizations was attributable to increases of $331.8 million in realized performance revenues and $172.1 million in realized principal investment income, partially offset by an increase of $130.5 million in realized performance compensation.
realized performance revenues were $1.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $331.8 million, compared to $787.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was primarily due to higher realized performance revenues in brep and breds.
realized principal investment income was $196.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $172.1 million, compared to $24.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was primarily due to the segment's allocation of the gain recognized in connection with the pátria sale transactions in the first and third quarters of 2021. for additional information, see note 4. "investments - equity method investments" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
realized performance compensation was $443.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $130.5 million, compared to $312.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was primarily due to the increase in realized performance revenues.

segment distributable earnings in our private equity segment in 2021 were higher compared to 2020. this was primarily driven by an increase in fee related earnings, as well as an increase in net realizations. generally favorable market conditions in 2021 contributed to significant realizations, as well as meaningful capital deployment opportunities, and robust economic activity in the u.s. has supported substantial recovery in investments in our corporate private equity portfolio that were impacted by the covid-19 pandemic. favorable market fundamentals also contributed to strong appreciation of investments in our corporate private equity funds across a number of sectors and geographies, albeit with some weakening at the end of 2021 and early 2022 as a result of increased equity market volatility in response to expectations of interest rate increases. strong performance in investors' alternative investment portfolios has in some cases resulted in alternative investments representing a significant portion of the value of such investors' portfolios, which may limit such investors' ability to allocate additional capital to certain funds in our private equity segment and negatively impact fundraising efforts if such investors do not increase their overall allocations to alternatives. acceleration of inflation in the u.s. is likely to continue in the near- to medium-term. higher inflation would potentially negatively impact segment distributable earnings in our private equity segment, particularly if not occurring against a backdrop of continued corresponding economic growth that can accommodate rising prices. in the u.s., heightened competition for workers, global supply chain issues and rising input costs have contributed to increasing wages and other inputs, which increasingly pressure profit margins. the valuations of certain investments in our private equity segment would potentially be negatively impacted if such companies cannot successfully identify and execute on means to mitigate margin pressures. in addition, interest rates are expected to continue to rise in 2022, including in connection with expected rate increase by the u.s. federal reserve. a period of sharply rising interest rates could increase the cost of debt financing for us and our portfolio companies. further, rising interest rates may contribute to a period of sustained declines in values in the equity markets and make it more difficult to realize value from our investments.
in energy, while oil and gas prices have recently been at their multi-year highest levels, weakened long-term market fundamentals continue to pose challenges for traditional energy, particularly in upstream energy. increased scrutiny from regulators, investors and other market participants on the esg impact of investments including in traditional energy sectors and in light of climate change and the impact of carbon emissions, has also exacerbated the impact of such weakened market fundamentals. the persistence of these weakened market fundamentals could further negatively impact the performance of certain investments in our energy and corporate private equity funds.
fee related earnings fee related earnings were $947.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $328.7 million, or 53%, compared to $619.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in fee related earnings was attributable to increases of $393.1 million in management and advisory fees, net and $212.1 million in fee related performance revenues, partially offset by increases of $207.3 million in fee related compensation and $69.3 million in other operating expenses.
management and advisory fees, net were $1.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $393.1 million, compared to $1.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2020, primarily driven by an increase in base management fees. base management fees increased $289.2 million primarily due to (a) the commencement of bcp viii's investment period and the end of its fee holiday in the first and second quarter of 2020, respectively,
(b) the commencement of bep iii's investment period and the end of its fee holiday in the first and third quarter of 2020, respectively, (c) the commencement bxg's investment period and the end of its fee holiday in the third quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, respectively and (d) the commencement of strategic partners gp solutions and strategic partners ix's investment periods in the second and fourth quarter of 2021, respectively.
the annualized base management fee rate increased from 1.00% at december 31, 2020 to 1.10% at december 31, 2021. the increase was primarily due to commencement of investment periods and subsequent fee holiday expirations for bcp viii, bep iii and bxg, as well as the commencement of investment periods for strategic partners gp solutions and strategic partners ix.
fee related performance revenues increased from zero for the year ended december 31, 2020 to $212.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase was due to the first crystallization of performance revenues in bip.
fee related compensation was $662.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $207.3 million, compared to $455.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was primarily due to increases in management and advisory fees, net and fee related performance revenues on which a portion of fee related compensation is based.
other operating expenses were $264.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $69.3 million, compared to $195.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was primarily due to technology related expenses and professional fees.
net realizations net realizations were $1.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $1.0 billion, or 172%, compared to $582.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in net realizations was attributable to increases of $1.4 billion in realized performance revenues and $191.3 million in realized principal investment income, partially offset by an increase of $576.3 million in realized performance compensation.
realized performance revenues were $2.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $1.4 billion, compared to $877.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was primarily due to higher realized performance revenues in corporate private equity and tactical opportunities.
realized principal investment income was $263.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $191.3 million, compared to $72.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was primarily due to the segment's allocation of the gain recognized in connection with the pátria sale transactions in the first and third quarters of 2021. for additional information, see note 4. "investments - equity method investments" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
realized performance compensation was $943.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $576.3 million, compared to $366.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was primarily due to the increase in realized performance revenues.

(a)   net returns are based on the change in carrying value (realized and unrealized) after management fees, expenses and performance revenues.
(b)   bcep is a core private equity strategy which invests with a more modest risk profile and longer hold period than traditional private equity.
(c)   realizations are treated as return of capital until fully recovered and therefore inception to date realized returns are not applicable. returns are calculated from results that are reported on a three month lag from strategic partners' fund financial statements and therefore do not include the impact of economic and market activities in the current quarter. effective september 30, 2021, strategic partners' fund financial reporting process was updated to report underlying fund investment performance generally on a same-quarter basis, if available. previously, such fund financial reporting in strategic partners' fund financial statements was generally on a three month lag. as a result of this update, strategic partners' appreciation for the year ended december 31, 2021, includes the economic and market activity of five quarters, respectively. see note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies - equity method investments" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" for additional information.
funds with closed investment periods the corporate private equity funds within the private equity segment have nine funds with closed investment periods: bcp iv, bcp v, bcp vi, bcp vii, bcom, bep i, bep ii, bcep i and bcp asia. as of december 31, 2021, bcp iv was above its carried interest threshold (i.e., the preferred return payable to its limited partners before the general partner is eligible to receive carried interest) and would still be above its carried interest threshold even if all remaining investments were valued at zero. bcp v is comprised of two fund classes, the bcp v "main fund" and bcp v-ac fund. within these fund classes, the general partner is subject to equalization such that (a) the general partner accrues carried interest when the respective carried interest for either fund class is positive and (b) the general partner realizes carried interest so long as clawback obligations, if any, for either of the respective fund classes are fully satisfied. bcp v, bcp vi, bcp vii, bcom, bep i, bcep i and bcp asia were above their respective carried interest thresholds. we are entitled to retain previously realized carried interest up to 20% of bcom's net gains. as a result, performance revenues are recognized from bcom on current period gains and losses. bep ii was below its carried interest threshold.

segment distributable earnings were $667.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $118.3 million, or 22%, compared to $549.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in segment distributable earnings was attributable to increases of $50.0 million in fee related earnings and $68.3 million in net realizations.
segment distributable earnings in our hedge fund solutions segment in 2021 were higher compared to 2020. this increase was primarily driven by an increase in fee related earnings, as well as an increase in net realizations. robust economic activity in the u.s. has supported a recovery across asset classes and sectors and the hedge fund solutions segment benefited from favorable liquidity conditions in 2021. nevertheless, another significant market downturn could pose material risks to our hedge fund solutions segment, including by potentially causing investors to seek liquidity in the form of redemptions from our funds and adversely impacting management fees. in an equity market environment that generally has been characterized by relatively low volatility, investors may continue to reallocate capital away from traditional hedge fund strategies. our hedge fund solutions segment operates multiple business lines, manages strategies that are both long and short asset classes and generates a majority of its revenue through management fees. in that regard, the segment's revenues depend in part on our ability to successfully grow such existing diverse business lines and strategies and to identify and scale new ones to meet evolving investor appetites. in recent years we have shifted the mix of our product offerings to include more products whose performance-based fees represent a more significant proportion of the fees earned from such products than has historically been the case.
fee related earnings fee related earnings were $396.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $50.0 million, or 14%, compared to $346.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in fee related earnings was primarily attributable to an increase of $59.8 million in management fees, net, partially offset by an increase of $15.0 million in other operating expenses.
management fees, net were $647.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $59.8 million, compared to $588.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, primarily driven by an increase in base management fees. base management fees increased $53.9 million primarily driven by fee-earning assets under management growth in our individual investor and specialized solutions platform.
other operating expenses were $94.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $15.0 million, compared to $79.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was primarily due to professional fees and technology related expenses.
net realizations net realizations were $271.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $68.3 million, or 34%, compared to $202.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in net realizations was primarily attributable to an increase of $111.2 million in realized performance revenues, partially offset by an increase of $45.5 million in realized performance compensation.
realized performance revenues were $291.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $111.2 million, compared to $179.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was primarily driven by realizations and higher returns for the year ended december 31, 2021, principally within customized solutions and commingled products.
realized performance compensation was $76.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $45.5 million, compared to $31.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was primarily due to the increase in realized performance revenues.

(a)   estimated % above high water mark/benchmark represents the percentage of invested performance eligible assets under management that as of the dates presented would earn performance fees when the applicable hedge fund solutions managed fund has positive investment performance relative to a benchmark, where applicable. incremental positive performance in the applicable blackstone funds may cause additional assets to reach their respective high water mark or clear a benchmark return, thereby resulting in an increase in estimated % above high water mark/benchmark.
(b)   for the hedge fund solutions managed funds, at december 31, 2021, the incremental appreciation needed for the 9% of invested performance eligible assets under management below their respective high water marks/benchmarks to reach their respective high water marks/benchmarks was $299.8 million, a decrease of $(323.1) million, compared to $622.9 million at december 31, 2020. of the invested performance eligible assets under management below their respective high water marks/ benchmarks as of december 31, 2021, 55% were within 5% of reaching their respective high water mark.

segment distributable earnings were $540.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $286.6 million, or 113%, compared to $254.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in segment distributable earnings was attributable to increases of $126.2 million in fee related earnings and $160.3 million in net realizations.
segment distributable earnings in our credit & insurance segment in 2021 were higher compared to 2020, driven by increases in net realizations and fee related earnings. favorable market conditions across many asset classes and tightening spreads, as well as solid underlying company performance, positively impacted returns in our credit & insurance segment. in 2021 we also benefited from strong fundraising momentum in our perpetual capital strategies, which represent an increasing percentage of our total assets under management. robust economic activity in the u.s. has supported a continued recovery across asset classes and sectors. the credit & insurance segment also benefited from favorable liquidity conditions in 2021. nevertheless, another significant market downturn could create additional pressure for borrowers with respect to their ability to meet their debt payment obligations or increase their focus on deleveraging. our funds have, however, continued to actively manage their portfolios in order to limit downside and protect capital. acceleration of inflation in the u.s. is likely to continue in the near- to medium-term. in the u.s., heightened competition for workers, global supply chain issues and rising input costs have contributed to increasing wages and other inputs, which increasingly pressure profit margins. the valuations of certain investments in our credit & insurance segment would potentially be negatively impacted if such companies are unable to mitigate margin pressures and experience an increase in leverage, especially if concurrent with an increase in their debt service costs. in addition, interest rates are expected to continue to rise in 2022, including in connection with expected rate increase by the u.s. federal reserve. if such rise occurs concurrently with a period of economic weakness or a slowdown in growth, capital deployment in our credit & insurance segment may be negatively impacted. in addition, interest rate increases could adversely affect segment distributable earnings in the segment, although we believe our current portfolio is relatively insulated because much of our debt portfolio is floating rate and/or short duration.
in energy, while oil and gas prices have recently been at their multi-year highest levels, weakened long-term market fundamentals continue to pose challenges for traditional energy, particularly in upstream energy. increased scrutiny from regulators, investors and other market participants on the esg impact of investments including in traditional energy sectors and in light of climate change and the impact of carbon emissions, has also exacerbated the impact of such weakened market fundamentals. the persistence of these weakened market fundamentals in the energy sector or in the credit markets more broadly could further negatively impact the performance of certain investments in our credit funds, although our funds actively managed exposure to upstream energy through exits of certain investments in 2021.
fee related earnings fee related earnings were $355.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $126.2 million, or 55%, compared to $228.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in fee related earnings was attributable to increases of $189.6 million in management fees, net and $77.6 million in fee related performance revenues, partially offset by increases of $106.1 million in fee related compensation and $34.8 million in other operating expenses.
management fees, net were $804.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $189.6 million, compared to $614.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, primarily driven by an increase in base management fees. base management fees increased $162.2 million primarily due to increased capital deployed in our most recently launched credit vehicles, fee-earning assets under management growth in bxsl, and inflows in bcred and our liquid credit business.
fee related performance revenues were $118.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $77.6 million, compared to $40.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was primarily due to performance and growth in assets in bxsl and the launch of bcred in the first quarter of 2021.
fee related compensation was $367.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $106.1 million, compared to $261.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was primarily due to increases in management fees, net and fee related performance revenues, on which a portion of fee related compensation is based.
other operating expenses were $199.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $34.8 million, compared to $165.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was primarily due to technology related expenses.
net realizations net realizations were $185.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $160.3 million, or 630%, compared to $25.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in net realizations was attributable to increases of $188.5 million in realized performance revenues and $62.8 million in realized principal investment income, partially offset by an increase of $91.0 million in realized performance compensation.
realized performance revenues were $209.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $188.5 million, compared to $20.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was primarily attributable to realized performance revenues generated by our mezzanine opportunistic funds.
realized principal investment income was $70.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $62.8 million, compared to $8.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was primarily due to the segment's allocation of the gain recognized in connection with the pátria sale transactions in the first and third quarters of 2021. for additional information, see note 4. "investments - equity method investments" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
realized performance compensation was $94.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, an increase of $91.0 million, compared to $3.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was primarily due to the increase in realized performance revenues.

(a)   this adjustment removes transaction-related charges, which are excluded from blackstone's segment presentation. transaction-related charges arise from corporate actions including acquisitions, divestitures, and blackstone's initial public offering. they consist primarily of equity-based compensation charges, gains and losses on contingent consideration arrangements, changes in the balance of the tax receivable agreement resulting from a change in tax law or similar event, transaction costs and any gains or losses associated with these corporate actions.
(b)   this adjustment removes the amortization of transaction-related intangibles, which are excluded from blackstone's segment presentation. this amount includes amortization of intangibles associated with blackstone's investment in pátria, which was historically accounted for under the equity method. as a result of pátria's ipo in january 2021, equity method has been discontinued and there will no longer be amortization of intangibles associated with the investment.
(c)   this adjustment reverses the effect of consolidating blackstone funds, which are excluded from blackstone's segment presentation. this adjustment includes the elimination of blackstone's interest in these funds and the removal of amounts associated with the ownership of blackstone consolidated operating partnerships held by non-controlling interests.
(d)   this adjustment removes unrealized performance revenues on a segment basis. the segment adjustment represents the add back of performance revenues earned from consolidated blackstone funds which have been eliminated in consolidation.

(e)   this adjustment removes unrealized performance allocations compensation.
(f)   this adjustment removes unrealized principal investment income (loss) on a segment basis. the segment adjustment represents (1) the add back of principal investment income, including general partner income, earned from consolidated blackstone funds which have been eliminated in consolidation, and (2) the removal of amounts associated with the ownership of blackstone consolidated operating partnerships held by non-controlling interests.
gaap unrealized principal investment income (loss)             $1,456,201             $(114,607       )                $215,003

(g)   this adjustment removes other revenues on a segment basis. the segment adjustment represents (1) the add back of other revenues earned from consolidated blackstone funds which have been eliminated in consolidation, and (2) the removal of certain transaction-related charges.
(h)   this adjustment removes equity-based compensation on a segment basis.
(i)   this adjustment adds an amount equal to an administrative fee collected on a quarterly basis from certain holders of blackstone holdings partnership units. the administrative fee is accounted for as a capital contribution under gaap, but is reflected as a reduction of other operating expenses in blackstone's segment presentation.
(j)   taxes represent the total gaap tax provision adjusted to include only the current tax provision (benefit) calculated on income (loss) before provision (benefit) for taxes and adjusted to exclude the tax impact of any divestitures. related payables represent tax-related payables including the amount payable under the tax receivable agreement. see "- key financial measures and indicators - distributable earnings" for the full definition of taxes and related payables.
(k)   this adjustment removes interest and dividend revenue less interest expense on a segment basis. the segment adjustment represents (1) the add back of interest and dividend revenue earned from consolidated blackstone funds which have been eliminated in consolidation, and (2) the removal of interest expense associated with the tax receivable agreement.
(l)   this adjustment removes the total segment amount of realized performance revenues.
(m)   this adjustment removes the total segment amount of realized performance compensation.
(n)   this adjustment removes the total segment amount of realized principal investment income.

liquidity and capital resources general blackstone's business model derives revenue primarily from third party assets under management. blackstone is not a capital or balance sheet intensive business and targets operating expense levels such that total management and advisory fees exceed total operating expenses each period. as a result, we require limited capital resources to support the working capital or operating needs of our businesses. we draw primarily on the long-term committed capital of our limited partner investors to fund the investment requirements of the blackstone funds and use our own realizations and cash flows to invest in growth initiatives, make commitments to our own funds, where our minimum general partner commitments are generally less than 5% of the limited partner commitments of a fund, and pay dividends to shareholders.
fluctuations in our statement of financial condition result primarily from activities of the blackstone funds that are consolidated as well as business transactions, such as the issuance of senior notes described below. the majority economic ownership interests of the blackstone funds are reflected as redeemable non-controlling interests in consolidated entities, and non-controlling interests in consolidated entities in the consolidated financial statements. the consolidation of these blackstone funds has no net effect on blackstone's net income or partners' capital. additionally, fluctuations in our statement of financial condition also include appreciation or depreciation in blackstone investments in the blackstone funds, additional investments and redemptions of such interests in the blackstone funds and the collection of receivables related to management and advisory fees.
total assets were $41.2 billion as of december 31, 2021, an increase of $14.9 billion, or 57%, from december 31, 2020. the increase in total assets was principally due to an increase of $14.5 billion in total assets attributable to consolidated operating partnerships. the increase in total assets attributable to consolidated operating partnerships was primarily due to an increase of $12.6 billion in investments. the increase in investments was primarily due to appreciation in the value of blackstone's interests in its private equity and real estate investments. the other net variances of the assets attributable to the consolidated operating partnerships were relatively unchanged.
total liabilities were $19.5 billion as of december 31, 2021, an increase of $7.8 billion, or 67%, from december 31, 2020. the increase in total liabilities was principally due to an increase of $7.9 billion in total liabilities attributable to consolidated operating partnerships. the increase in total liabilities attributable to the consolidated operating partnerships was primarily due to increases of $4.5 billion in accrued compensation and benefits and $2.1 billion in loans payable. the increase in accrued compensation and benefits was primarily due to an increase in performance compensation. the increase in loans payable was primarily due to the issuance of $2.0 billion of notes on august 5, 2021. the other net variances of the liabilities attributable to the consolidated operating partnerships were relatively unchanged.
we have multiple sources of liquidity to meet our capital needs as described in "- sources and uses of liquidity."
sources and uses of liquidity we have multiple sources of liquidity to meet our capital needs, including annual cash flows, accumulated earnings in our businesses, the proceeds from our issuances of senior notes, liquid investments we hold on our balance sheet and access to our $2.25 billion committed revolving credit facility. as of december 31, 2021, blackstone had $2.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $658.1 million invested in corporate treasury investments and $3.3 billion in other investments (which included $726.7 million of liquid investments), against $7.9 billion in borrowings from our bond issuances, and $250.0 million borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. the $250.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility was repaid on january 14, 2022.
on august 5, 2021, blackstone issued $650 million aggregate principal amount of 1.625% senior notes due august 5, 2028, $800 million aggregate principal amount of 2.000% senior notes due january 30, 2032 and $550 million aggregate principal amount of 2.850% senior notes due august 5, 2051. for additional information see note 13. "borrowings" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this filing and "- notable transactions."
on january 10, 2022, blackstone issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.550% senior notes due march 30, 2032 and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.200% senior notes due january 30, 2052. for additional information see note 13. "borrowings" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this filing and "- notable transactions."
in addition to the cash we received from our notes offerings and availability under our revolving credit facility, we expect to receive (a) cash generated from operating activities, (b) performance allocations and incentive fee realizations, and (c) realizations on the fund investments that we make. the amounts received from these three sources in particular may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter depending on the frequency and size of realization events or net returns experienced by our investment funds. our available capital could be adversely affected if there are prolonged periods of few substantial realizations from our investment funds accompanied by substantial capital calls for new investments from those investment funds. therefore, blackstone's commitments to our funds are taken into consideration when managing our overall liquidity and cash position.
we expect that our primary liquidity needs will be cash to (a) provide capital to facilitate the growth of our existing businesses, which principally includes funding our general partner and co-investment commitments to our funds, (b) provide capital for business expansion, (c) pay operating expenses, including cash compensation to our employees, and other obligations as they arise, (d) fund modest capital expenditures, (e) repay borrowings and related interest costs, (f) pay income taxes, (g) repurchase share of our common stock and blackstone holdings partnership units pursuant to our repurchase program and (h) pay dividends to our shareholders and distributions to the holders of blackstone holdings partnership units. for a tabular presentation of blackstone's contractual obligations and the expected timing of such see "- contractual obligations."

(a)   for some of the general partner commitments shown in the table above, we require our senior managing directors and certain other professionals to fund a portion of the commitment even though the ultimate obligation to fund the aggregate commitment is ours pursuant to the governing agreements of the respective funds. the amounts of the aggregate applicable general partner original and remaining commitment are shown in the table above. in addition, certain senior managing directors and other professionals may be required to fund a de minimis amount of the commitment in certain carry funds. we expect our commitments to be drawn down over time and to be funded by available cash and cash generated from operations and realizations. taking into account prevailing market conditions and both the liquidity and cash or liquid investment balances, we believe that the sources of liquidity described above will be more than sufficient to fund our working capital requirements.

(a)   the notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the issuer and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by blackstone inc. and each of the blackstone holdings partnerships. the notes contain customary covenants and financial restrictions that, among other things, limit the issuer and the guarantors' ability, subject to certain exceptions, to incur indebtedness secured by liens on voting stock or profit participating equity interests of their subsidiaries or merge, consolidate or sell, transfer or lease assets. the notes also contain customary events of default. all or a portion of the notes may be redeemed at our option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, prior to their stated maturity, at the make-whole redemption price set forth in the notes. if a change of control repurchase event occurs, the notes are subject to repurchase at the repurchase price as set forth in the notes.
on january 10, 2022, blackstone issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.550% senior notes due march 30, 2032 and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.200% senior notes due january 30, 2052. these notes are not included in the above table. for additional information see note 13.

(a)   we lease our primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that expire through 2032. occupancy lease agreements, in addition to contractual rent payments, generally include additional payments for certain costs incurred by the landlord, such as building expenses, and utilities. to the extent these are fixed or determinable they are included in the table above. the table above includes operating leases that are recognized as operating lease liabilities, short-term leases that are not recorded as operating lease liabilities and leases that have been signed but not yet commenced which are not recorded as operating lease liabilities. the amounts in this table are presented net of contractual sublease commitments.
(b)   represents the principal amount due on the senior notes we issued assuming no pre-payments are made and the notes are held until their final maturity and outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. as of december 31, 2021, we had $250.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolver, which are presented as due in 2025, the contractual maturity date of the revolver. on january 14, 2022, blackstone repaid the $250.0 million borrowings under the revolver in full. this presentation also assumes interest is paid on the outstanding borrowings under the revolver through the contractual maturity date with a corresponding reduction in commitment fees for unutilized borrowings under the revolver. on january 10, 2022, blackstone issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.550% senior notes due march 30, 2032 and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.200% senior notes due january 30, 2052. these notes and the related interest payments are not included in this table. for additional information see note 13. "borrowings" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this filing and "- notable transactions."
(c)   represents interest to be paid over the maturity of our senior notes and borrowings under our revolving credit facility which has been calculated using the maturity assumption described in note (b). these amounts include commitment fees for unutilized borrowings under our revolver.
(d)   these obligations represent commitments of the consolidated blackstone funds to make capital contributions to investee funds and portfolio companies. these amounts are generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the less than one year category.
(e)   represents obligations by blackstone's corporate subsidiary to make payments under the tax receivable agreements to certain non-controlling interest holders for the tax savings realized from the taxable purchases of their interests in connection with the reorganization at the time of blackstone's ipo in 2007 and subsequent purchases. the obligation represents the amount of the payments currently expected to be made, which are dependent on the tax savings actually realized as determined annually without discounting for the timing of the payments. as required by gaap, the amount of the obligation included in the consolidated financial statements and shown in note 18. "related party transactions" (see "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data") differs to reflect the net present value of the payments due to certain non-controlling interest holders.
(f)   the total represents gross unrecognized tax benefits of $0.5 million and interest and penalties of $0.6 million. in addition, blackstone is not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with gross unrecognized benefits of $47.0 million and interest of $4.8 million; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligations table.
(g)   these obligations represent commitments by us to provide general partner capital funding to the blackstone funds, limited partner capital funding to other funds and blackstone principal investment commitments. these amounts are generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the less than one year category; however, a substantial amount of the capital commitments are expected to be called over the next three years. we expect to continue to make these general partner capital commitments as we raise additional amounts for our investment funds over time.
guarantees blackstone and certain of its consolidated funds provide financial guarantees. the amounts and nature of these guarantees are described in note 19. "commitments and contingencies - contingencies - guarantees" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "-item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this filing.
indemnifications in many of its service contracts, blackstone agrees to indemnify the third party service provider under certain circumstances. the terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the above contractual obligations table or recorded in our consolidated financial statements as of december 31, 2021.
clawback obligations performance allocations are subject to clawback to the extent that the performance allocations received to date with respect to a fund exceeds the amount due to blackstone based on cumulative results of that fund. the amounts and nature of blackstone's clawback obligations are described in note 19. "commitments and contingencies - contingencies - contingent obligations (clawback)" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this filing.
share repurchase program on december 7, 2021, blackstone's board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of common stock and blackstone holdings partnership units. under the repurchase program, repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. the timing and the actual number repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions. the repurchase program may be changed, suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date.
during the year ended december 31, 2021, blackstone repurchased 10.3 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $1.2 billion. as of december 31, 2021, the amount remaining available for repurchases under the program was $1.5 billion.
dividends our intention is to pay to holders of common stock a quarterly dividend representing approximately 85% of blackstone inc.'s share of distributable earnings, subject to adjustment by amounts determined by our board of directors to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of our business, to make appropriate investments in our business and funds, to comply with applicable law, any of our debt instruments or other agreements, or to provide for future cash requirements such as tax-related payments, clawback obligations and dividends to shareholders for any ensuing quarter. the dividend amount could also be adjusted upward in any one quarter.
for blackstone's definition of distributable earnings, see "- key financial measures and indicators."
all of the foregoing is subject to the qualification that the declaration and payment of any dividends are at the sole discretion of our board of directors, and our board of directors may change our dividend policy at any time, including, without limitation, to reduce such quarterly dividends or even to eliminate such dividends entirely.
because the publicly traded entity and/or its wholly owned subsidiaries must pay taxes and make payments under the tax receivable agreements, the amounts ultimately paid as dividends by blackstone to common shareholders in respect of each fiscal year are generally expected to be less, on a per share or per unit basis, than the amounts distributed by the blackstone holdings partnerships to the blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of the blackstone holdings partnerships in respect of their blackstone holdings partnership units. following the conversion, we expect to pay more corporate income taxes than we would have as a limited partnership, which will increase this difference between the per share dividend and per unit distribution amounts.
dividends are treated as qualified dividends to the extent of blackstone's current and accumulated earnings and profits, with any excess dividends treated as a return of capital to the extent of the shareholder's basis.
the following graph shows fiscal quarterly and annual per common shareholder dividends for 2021, 2020 and 2019. dividends are declared and paid in the quarter subsequent to the quarter in which they are earned.
with respect to fiscal year 2021, we paid to shareholders of our common stock a dividend of $0.82, $0.70, $1.09 and $1.45 per share in respect of the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively, aggregating to $4.06 per share of common stock. with respect to fiscal years 2020 and 2019, we paid shareholders of our common stock aggregate dividends of $2.26 per share and $1.95 per share, respectively.
leverage we may under certain circumstances use leverage opportunistically and over time to create the most efficient capital structure for blackstone and our shareholders. in addition to the borrowings from our notes issuances and our revolving credit facility, we may use reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and securities sold, not yet purchased. reverse repurchase agreements are entered into primarily to take advantage of opportunistic yields otherwise absent in the overnight markets and also to use the collateral received to cover securities sold, not yet purchased. repurchase agreements are entered into primarily to opportunistically yield higher spreads on purchased securities. the balances held in these financial instruments fluctuate based on blackstone's liquidity needs, market conditions and investment risk profiles.
the following table presents information regarding these financial instruments in our consolidated statements of financial condition:
repurchase                 securities agreements              sold, not yet purchased critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap. in applying many of these accounting principles, we need to make assumptions, estimates and/or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. these assumptions, estimates and/or judgments, however, are often subjective. actual results may be affected negatively based on changing circumstances. if actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. we believe the following critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates and/or judgments. for a description of our accounting policies, see note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this filing.
principles of consolidation for a description of our accounting policy on consolidation, see note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies - consolidation" and note 9. "variable interest entities" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" for detailed information on blackstone's involvement with vies. the following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of consolidation principles impact our financial results, and management's process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment.
the determination that blackstone holds a controlling financial interest in a blackstone fund or investment vehicle significantly changes the presentation of our consolidated financial statements. in our consolidated statements of financial position included in this filing, we present 100% of the assets and liabilities of consolidated vies along with a non-controlling interest which represents the portion of the consolidated vehicle's interests held by third parties. however, assets of our consolidated vies can only be used to settle obligations of the consolidated vie and are not available for general use by blackstone. further, the liabilities of our consolidated vies do not have recourse to the general credit of blackstone. in the consolidated statements of operations, we eliminate any management fees, incentive fees, or performance allocations received or accrued from consolidated vies as they are considered intercompany transactions. we recognize 100% of the consolidated vie's investment income (loss) and allocate the portion of that income (loss) attributable to third party ownership to non-controlling interests in arriving at net income attributable to blackstone inc.
the assessment of whether we consolidate a blackstone fund or investment vehicle we manage requires the application of significant judgment. these judgments are applied both at the time we become involved with the vie and on an ongoing basis and include, but are not limited to:
•   determining whether our management fees, incentive fees or performance allocations represent variable interests - we make judgments as to whether the fees we earn are commensurate with the level of effort required for those fees and at market rates. in making this judgment, we consider, among other things, the extent of third party investment in the entity and the terms of any other interests we hold in the vie.
•   determining whether kick-out rights are substantive - we make judgments as to whether the third party investors in a partnership entity have the ability to remove the general partner, the investment manager or its equivalent, or to dissolve (liquidate) the partnership entity, through a simple majority vote. this includes an evaluation of whether barriers to exercise these rights exist.
•   concluding whether blackstone has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie - as there is no explicit threshold in gaap to define "potentially significant," management must apply judgment and evaluate both quantitative and qualitative factors to conclude whether this threshold is met.
revenue recognition for a description of our accounting policy on revenue recognition, see note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies - revenue recognition" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data." for an additional description of the nature of our revenue arrangements, including how management fees, incentive fees, and performance allocations are generated, please refer to "part i. item 1. business - fee structure/incentive arrangements." the following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of revenue recognition principles impact our financial results, and management's process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment.
management and advisory fees, net - blackstone earns base management fees from its customers at a fixed percentage of a calculation base which is typically assets under management, net asset value, gross asset value, total assets, committed capital or invested capital. the range of management fee rates and the calculation base from which they are earned, generally, are as follows:
on private equity, real estate, and certain of our hedge fund solutions and credit-focused funds:
•   0.25% to 1.75% of committed capital or invested capital during the investment period,
•   0.25% to 1.50% of invested capital, committed capital or investment fair value subsequent to the investment period for private equity and real estate funds, and
•   1.00% to 1.50% of invested capital or net asset value subsequent to the investment period for certain of our hedge fund solutions and credit-focused funds.
on real estate and credit-focused funds structured like hedge funds:
•   0.50% to 1.50% of net asset value.
on credit separately managed accounts:
•   0.20% to 1.35% of net asset value or total assets.
•   0.65% to 2.00% of invested capital, net operating income or net asset value.
on insurance separately managed accounts and investment vehicles:
•   0.25% to 1.00% of net asset value.
•   0.25% to 1.50% of net asset value.
•   0.20% to 0.50% of the aggregate par amount of collateral assets, including principal cash.
on credit-focused registered and non-registered investment companies:
•   0.25% to 1.25% of total assets or net asset value.
the investment adviser of bxmt receives annual management fees based on 1.50% of bxmt's net proceeds received from equity offerings and accumulated "distributable earnings" (which is generally equal to its gaap net income excluding certain non-cash and other items), subject to certain adjustments. the investment advisers of breit and bepif receive a management fee of 1.25% per annum of net asset value, payable monthly.
management fee calculations based on committed capital or invested capital are mechanical in nature and therefore do not require the use of significant estimates or judgments. management fee calculations based on net asset value, total assets, or investment fair value depend on the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds and could vary depending on the valuation methodology that is used as well as economic conditions. see "- fair value" below for further discussion of the judgment required for determining the fair value of the underlying investments.
investment income (loss) - performance allocations are made to the general partner based on cumulative fund performance to date, subject to a preferred return to limited partners. blackstone has concluded that investments made alongside its limited partners in a partnership which entitle blackstone to a performance allocation represent equity method investments that are not in the scope of the gaap guidance on accounting for revenues from contracts with customers. blackstone accounts for these arrangements under the equity method of accounting. under the equity method, blackstone's share of earnings (losses) from equity method investments is determined using a balance sheet approach referred to as the hypothetical liquidation at book value ("hlbv") method. under the hlbv method, at the end of each reporting period blackstone calculates the accrued performance allocations that would be due to blackstone for each fund pursuant to the fund agreements as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of such date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. performance allocations are subject to clawback to the extent that the performance allocation received to date exceeds the amount due to blackstone based on cumulative results.
the change in the fair value of the investments held by certain blackstone funds is a significant input into the accrued performance allocation calculation and accrual for potential repayment of previously received performance allocations. estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. see "- fair value" below for further discussion related to significant estimates and assumptions used for determining fair value of the underlying investments.
fair value blackstone uses fair value throughout the reporting process. for a description of our accounting policies related to valuation, see note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies - fair value of financial instruments" and "summary of significant accounting policies - investments at fair value" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this filing. the following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of fair value principles impact our financial results, and management's process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment.
the fair value of the investments held by blackstone funds is the primary input to the calculation of certain of our management fees, incentive fees, performance allocations and the related compensation we recognize. the blackstone funds are accounted for as investment companies under the american institute of certified public accountants accounting and auditing guide, investment companies, and in accordance with the gaap guidance on investment companies and reflect their investments, including majority-owned and controlled investments (the "portfolio companies"), at fair value. in the absence of observable market prices, we utilize valuation methodologies applied on a consistent basis and assumptions that we believe market participants would use to determine the fair value of the investments. for investments where little market activity exists management's determination of fair value is based on the best information available in the circumstances, which may incorporate management's own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment, and the consideration of a combination of internal and external factors, including the appropriate risk adjustments for non-performance and liquidity risks.
blackstone has also elected the fair value option for certain instruments it owns directly, including loans and receivables and investments in private debt securities, the assets of consolidated clo vehicles and other proprietary investments. blackstone is required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value, including debt instruments, equity securities and freestanding derivatives.
fair value of investments or instruments that are publicly traded securities that are publicly traded and for which a quoted market exists will be valued at the closing price of such securities in the principal market in which the security trades, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market on the valuation date. when a quoted price in an active market exists, no block discounts or control premiums are permitted regardless of the size of the public security held. in some cases, securities will include legal and contractual restrictions limiting their purchase and sale for a period of time, such as may be required under sec rule 144. a discount to publicly traded price may be appropriate in those cases; the amount of the discount, if taken, shall be determined based on the time period that must pass before the restricted security becomes unrestricted or otherwise available for sale.
fair value of investments or instruments that are not publicly traded investments for which market prices are not observable include private investments in the equity or debt of operating companies or real estate properties. our primary methodology for determining the fair values of such investments is generally the income approach which provides an indication of fair value based on the present value of cash flows that a business, security, or property is expected to generate in the future. the most widely used methodology under the income approach is the discounted cash flow method which includes significant assumptions about the underlying investment's projected net earnings or cash flows, discount rate, capitalization rate and exit multiple. our secondary methodology, generally used to corroborate the results of the income approach, is typically the market approach. the most widely used methodology under the market approach relies upon valuations for comparable public companies, transactions, or assets, and includes making judgments about which companies, transactions, or assets are comparable. depending on the facts and circumstances associated with the investment, different primary and secondary methodologies may be used including option value, contingent claims or scenario analysis, yield analysis, projected cash flow through maturity or expiration, probability weighted methods or recent round of financing.
in certain cases debt and equity securities are valued on the basis of prices from an orderly transaction between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services. in determining the value of a particular investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrices and market transactions in comparable investments and various relationships between investments.
management process on fair value due to the importance of fair value throughout the consolidated financial statements and the significant judgment required to be applied in arriving at those fair values, we have developed a process around valuation that incorporates several levels of approval and review from both internal and external sources. investments held by blackstone funds and investment vehicles are valued on at least a quarterly basis by our internal valuation or asset management teams, which are independent from our investment teams.
for investments valued utilizing the income method and where blackstone has information rights, we generally have a direct line of communication with each of the portfolio company finance teams and collect financial data used to support projections used in a discounted cash flow analysis. the respective business unit's valuation team then analyzes the data received and updates the valuation models reflecting any changes in the underlying cash flow projections, weighted-average cost of capital, exit multiple, and any other valuation input relevant economic conditions.
the results of all valuations of investments held by blackstone fund and investment vehicles are reviewed and approved by the relevant business unit's valuation sub-committee, which is comprised of key personnel from the business unit, typically the chief investment officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, chief compliance officer (or their respective equivalents where applicable) and other senior managing directors in the business. to further corroborate results, each business unit also generally obtains either a positive assurance opinion or a range of value from an independent valuation party, at least annually for internally prepared valuations for investments that have been held by blackstone funds and investment vehicles for greater than a year and quarterly for certain investments. our firmwide valuation committee, chaired by our chief financial officer and comprised of senior members of our businesses and representatives from corporate functions, including legal and finance, reviews the valuation process for investments held by us and our investment vehicles, including the application of appropriate valuation standards on a consistent basis. each quarter, the valuation process is also reviewed by the audit committee of our board of directors, which is comprised of our employee directors.
the global outbreak of covid-19 required management to make significant judgments about the ultimate adverse impact of covid-19 on financial markets and economic conditions. these judgments and estimates were incorporated into the valuation process outlined herein. management's policies were unchanged and certain critical processes were executed in a remote working environment.
income tax for a description of our accounting policy on taxes and additional information on taxes see note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies" and note 15. "income taxes," respectively, in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this filing.
our provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. current income taxes approximate taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the applicable enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. the conversion resulted in a step-up in the tax basis of certain assets that will be recovered as those assets are sold or the basis is amortized.
additionally, significant judgment is required in estimating the provision for (benefit from) income taxes, current and deferred tax balances (including valuation allowance), accrued interest or penalties and uncertain tax positions. in evaluating these judgments, we consider, among other items, projections of taxable income (including the character of such income), beginning with historic results and incorporating assumptions of the amount of future pretax operating income. these assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates that blackstone uses to manage its business. a portion of the deferred tax assets are not considered to be more likely than not to be realized due to the character of income necessary for recovery. for that portion of the deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance has been recorded.
revisions in estimates and/or actual costs of a tax assessment may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, if any.

"summary of significant accounting policies" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this filing.
interbank offered rates transition certain jurisdictions are currently reforming or phasing out their benchmark interest rates, most notably the london interbank offered rates ("libor") across multiple currencies. many such reforms and phase outs became effective at the end calendar year 2021 with select u.s. dollar libor tenors persisting through june 2023. blackstone has taken steps to prepare for and mitigate the impact of changing base rates and continues to manage transition efforts and evaluate the impact of prospective changes on existing transactions and contractual arrangements. see "part i. item 1a. risk factors - risks related to our business - interest rates on our and our portfolio companies' outstanding financial instruments might be subject to change based on regulatory developments, which could adversely affect our revenue, expenses and the value of those financial instruments."

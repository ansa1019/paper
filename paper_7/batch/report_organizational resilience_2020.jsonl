we have built a strong global presence with core competencies in areas like nanoscale applications enablement, chemistry, plasma and fluidics, advanced systems engineering and a broad range of operational disciplines. our products and services are designed to help our customers build smaller, faster, and better performing devices that are used in a variety of electronic products, including mobile phones, personal computers, servers, wearables, automotive vehicles, and data storage devices. our customer base includes leading semiconductor memory, foundry, and integrated device manufacturers that make products such as nvm, dram, and logic devices. we aim to increase our strategic relevance with our customers by contributing more to their continued success. our core technical competency is integrating hardware, process, materials, software, and process control enabling results on the wafer. semiconductor manufacturing, our customers' business, involves the complete fabrication of multiple dies or integrated circuits on a wafer. this involves the repetition of a set of core processes and can require hundreds of continues on next page lam research corporation 2020 10-k individual steps. fabricating these devices requires highly sophisticated process technologies to integrate an increasing array of new materials with precise control at the atomic scale. along with meeting technical requirements, wafer processing equipment must deliver high productivity and be cost-effective. demand from the cloud, iot, and other markets is driving the need for increasingly powerful and cost-efficient semiconductors. at the same time, there are growing technical challenges with traditional scaling. these trends are driving significant inflections in semiconductor manufacturing, such as the increasing importance of vertical 3d scaling strategies as well as multiple patterning to enable shrinks. we believe we are in a strong position with our leadership and competency in deposition, etch, and clean to facilitate some of the most significant innovations in semiconductor device manufacturing. we have a broad portfolio of products that provide complementary processing steps used throughout semiconductor manufacturing. our customer support business group focuses attention on delivery solutions that meet our customers' technical requirements as well as productivity needs during the equipment lifecycle. several factors create opportunity for sustainable differentiation for us: (i) our focus on research and development, with several on-going programs relating to sustaining engineering, product and process development, and concept and feasibility; (ii) our ability to effectively leverage cycles of learning from our broad installed base; (iii) our collaborative focus with ecosystem partners; and (iv) our focus on delivering our multi-product solutions with a goal to enhance the value of lam's solutions to our customers. during fiscal year 2020, customer demand remained relatively strong, however we experienced covid-19-related production and supply chain disruptions, which impacted the timing of revenue recognition and negatively impacted our gross margin. while we are currently seeing improvements in both our own operations and those of our suppliers, risks and uncertainties related to the covid-19 pandemic remain, which may negatively impact our revenue and gross margin. over the longer term, while there are risks that the impact of covid-19 to the broader macroeconomic environment may negatively impact our customer demand, we believe that secular demand for semiconductors will continue to drive sustainable growth for our products and services, and that technology inflections in our industry, including 3d device scaling, multiple patterning, process flow, and advanced packaging chip integration will lead to an increase in our served addressable market for our products and services in deposition, etch, and clean. the following table summarizes certain key financial information for the periods indicated below: year ended change june 28, june 30, june 24, fy20 vs. fy19 fy19 vs. fy18 2020 2019 2018 (in

in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 as a result of higher yield, offset by a lower cash balance. interest expense increased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 primarily due to the full-year impact of the issuance of the $2.5 billion of senior notes that occurred in fiscal year 2019 and the issuance of $2.0 billion senior notes in fiscal year 2020. the increase in interest expense in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was also primarily due to the issuance of the $2.5 billion of senior notes in fiscal year 2019. the gains on deferred compensation plan related assets in the periods presented were driven by an improvement in the fair market value of the underlying funds. the loss on impairment of investments during fiscal year 2018 is the result of a decision to sell selected investments held in foreign jurisdictions in connection with our cash repatriation strategy following the december 2017 u.s. tax reform. income tax expense our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate for the periods indicated were as follows: year ended change june 28, june 30, june 24, fy20 vs. fy19 fy19 vs. fy18 2020 2019 2018 (in thousands, except percentages) income tax expense $323,225 $255,141 $771,108 $68,084 26.7 % $(515,967 ) (66.9 )% effective tax rate 12.6 % 10.4 % 24.5 % 2.2% (14.1)% the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a cumulative income tax benefit reversal due to a court ruling in fiscal year 2020, as outlined below. the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the impact of u.s. tax reform and its mandated one-time transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings in fiscal year 2018. in november 2019, the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit (\"ninth circuit\") rejected the en banc appeal petitioned by altera corporation (\"altera\") in july 2019. in that quarter, we evaluated the impact of the decision continues on next page lam research corporation 2020 10-k and viewed the denial as an indication that altera's position of excluding stock-based compensation expense in an inter-company cost-sharing arrangement was unlikely to be sustained upon further litigation. as a result, we reversed $74.5 million of net tax assets associated with stock-based compensation benefits related to previous years in the condensed consolidated financial statements in the three months ended december 29, 2019 and we no longer reflected a net tax benefit within our financial statements related to excluding stock-based compensation from our inter-company cost-sharing arrangement. in february 2020, altera petitioned the supreme court of the united states (\"scotus\") to hear their case. in june 2020, the scotus denied the petition. international revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues, such that a material portion of our pre-tax income is earned and taxed outside the united states. international pre-tax income is taxable in the united states at a lower effective tax rate than the federal statutory tax rate. please refer to note 7 of our consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this 2020 form 10-k. deferred income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. our gross deferred tax assets were $575 million and $471 million at the end of fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. these gross deferred tax assets were offset by gross deferred tax liabilities of $196 million and $160 million at the end of fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively, and a valuation allowance of $245 million and $227 million at the end of fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. the change in the gross deferred tax assets, gross deferred tax liabilities, and valuation allowance between fiscal year 2020 and 2019 is primarily due to increases in outside basis differences of foreign subsidiaries, tax credits, and operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, and decreases in prepaid cost sharing. as of our fiscal year ended june 28, 2020, we continue to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire california deferred tax asset balance due to the single sales factor apportionment resulting in lower taxable income in california. the valuation allowances were $245 million and $227 million at the end of fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. we evaluate if the deferred tax assets are realizable on a quarterly basis and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances, if any. uncertain tax positions we re-evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. any change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (\"gaap\") requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. actual results could differ significantly from those estimates, which could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. our critical accounting estimates include: • the recognition and valuation of revenue from arrangements with multiple performance obligations which impacts revenue; • the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin; • the valuation of warranty reserves, which impacts gross margin; • the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes, including the measurement of uncertain tax positions, which impact our provision for income tax expenses; and continues on next page lam research corporation 2020 10-k • the valuation and recoverability of long-lived assets, which impacts gross margin and operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization. we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements regarding the critical accounting estimates indicated above. see note 2, \"summary of significant accounting policies,\" of our consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this 2020 form 10-k for additional information regarding our accounting policies. revenue recognition: on june 25, 2018, we adopted financial accounting standards board (\"fasb\") accounting standards update (\"asu\") no. 2014-09 (\"asc 606\") - revenue from contracts with customers which provides guidance for revenue recognition that superseded the revenue recognition requirements in asc 605, revenue recognition and most industry specific guidance. we recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services by following a five-step process, (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation, as further described below. identify the contract with a customer. we generally consider documentation of terms with an approved purchase order as a customer contract, provided that collection is considered probable, which is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks, payment histories, and/or other circumstances. identify the performance obligations in the contract. performance obligations include sales of systems, spare parts, and services. in addition, our customer contracts contain provisions for installation and training services which have been deemed immaterial in the context of the contract. determine the transaction price. the transaction price for our contracts with customers consists of both fixed and variable consideration provided it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty related to variable consideration is resolved. fixed consideration includes amounts to be contractually billed to the customer while variable consideration includes estimates for discounts and credits for future usage which are based on contractual terms outlined in volume purchase agreements and other factors known at the time. we generally invoice customers at shipment and for professional services either as provided or upon meeting certain milestones. customer invoices are generally due within 30 to 90 days after issuance. our contracts with customers typically do not include significant financing components as the period between the transfer of performance obligations and timing of payment are generally within one year. allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. for contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract on a relative standalone selling price basis. standalone selling prices are based on multiple factors including, but not limited to historical discounting trends for products and services and pricing practices in different geographies. recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation. revenue for systems and spares are recognized at a point in time, which is generally upon shipment or delivery. revenue from services is recognized over time as services are completed or ratably over the contractual period of generally one year or less. inventory valuation: our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management's estimated usage requirement is written down to its estimated net realizable value if less than cost. estimates of market value include but are not limited to management's forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, and possible alternative uses. if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision. warranty: we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue. we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which continues on next page lam research corporation 2020 10-k those differences arise or are identified. we do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems. income taxes: deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. in the event that we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment will be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance will be reversed. we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. long-lived assets: we review goodwill at least annually for impairment. if certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests, we will perform an impairment test at that date. in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we: (1) allocate goodwill to the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2) estimate the fair value of our reporting units; and (3) determine the carrying value (book value) of those reporting units. prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units, we assess long-lived assets for impairment. furthermore, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. this can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in-process r&d and developed technology. only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, be determined. in our goodwill impairment process we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis. we do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. we determine the fair value of our reporting units by using an income approach. under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units, including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment. although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit. in addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units. changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge. as a result, several factors could result in an impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods, including but not limited to: (1) weakening of the global economy, weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry, or our failure to reach internal forecasts, which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units; and (2) a decline in our common stock price and resulting market capitalization, to the extent we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. further, the value assigned to intangible assets, other than goodwill, is based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and lifecycle of products and technology acquired. if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value. continues on next page lam research corporation 2020 10-k for other long-lived assets, we routinely consider whether indicators of impairment are present. if such indicators are present, we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets is less than their carrying value. if the sum is less, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. we recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset's carrying value. the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset's new carrying value, which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value. in addition, for fully amortized intangible assets, we derecognize the gross cost and accumulated amortization in the period we determine the intangible asset no longer enhances future cash flows. recent accounting pronouncements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see note 3, \"recent accounting pronouncements,\" of our consolidated financial statements, included in part ii, item 8 of this 2020 form 10-k. liquidity and capital resources total gross cash, cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash and investments balances were $7.0 billion at the end of fiscal year 2020 compared to $5.7 billion at the end of fiscal year 2019. this increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities and the issuance of $2.0 billion of senior notes, partially offset by common stock repurchases in connection with our stock repurchase program and dividends paid. cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities of $2.1 billion during fiscal year 2020 consisted of (in thousands): net income $2,251,753 non-cash charges: depreciation and amortization 268,525 equity-based compensation expense 189,197 deferred income taxes (17,777 ) amortization of note discounts and issuance costs 5,940 changes in operating asset and liability accounts (571,875 ) other 688 $2,126,451 significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts, net of foreign exchange impact, included the following uses of cash: increases in accounts receivable of $642 million, inventories of $412 million, and prepaid assets of $14 million; partially offset by sources of cash: increases in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $211 million, accounts payable of $208 million, and deferred profit of $76 million. cash flow from investing activities net cash used by investing activities during fiscal year 2020 was $244 million, primarily consisting of capital expenditures of $203 million. cash flow from financing activities net cash used by financing activities during fiscal year 2020 was $624 million, primarily consisting of $1.4 billion in common stock repurchases, $657 million of dividends paid, partially offset by $1.3 billion of net proceeds from issuance of debt, and $94 million of stock issuance and treasury stock reissuances associated with our employee stock-based compensation plans. continues on next page lam research corporation 2020 10-k 41 liquidity given that the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and has historically experienced rapid changes in demand, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in r&d and capital infrastructure. anticipated cash flows from operations based on our current business outlook, combined with our current levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of june 28, 2020, are expected to be sufficient to support our anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, capital redistributions, and dividends through at least the next twelve months. however, uncertainty in the global economy and the semiconductor industry, as well as disruptions in credit markets, have in the past, and could in the future, impact customer demand for our products, as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors. in the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services. while we have substantial cash balances, we may require additional funding and need or choose to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. we believe that, if necessary, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. however, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no assurance that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us. off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not. obligations that are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with gaap include our long-term debt, operating leases and finance leases which are outlined in the following table. our off-balance sheet arrangements are presented as purchase obligations in the table. our contractual obligations and

consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities and the long-term portion of operating leases. operating leases we lease most of our administrative, r&d, and manufacturing facilities; regional sales/service offices; and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. certain of our facility leases for buildings located in fremont and livermore, california; tualatin, oregon; and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. in addition to amounts included in the table above, we have guaranteed residual values for certain of our fremont and livermore facility leases of up to $250

contractual service provided. income taxes during the december 2017 quarter, a one-time transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings, estimated at $991 million, was recognized associated with the december 2017 u.s. tax reform. in accordance with sab 118, we finalized the amount of the transition tax during the period ended december 23, 2018. the final amount was $868.4 million. we elected to pay the one-time transition tax over a period of eight years with 8% of the transition tax to be paid each september 15 for years 2018 through 2022, and 15%, 20%, and 25%, respectively, to be paid each september 15 for years 2023 through 2025. long-term debt on may 5, 2020, we completed a public offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of the company's senior

year ended june 28, 2020, $500 million principal value of 2020 notes were settled upon maturity. we may redeem the 2021, 2025, 2026, 2029, 2030, 2049, 2050, and 2060 notes (collectively the \"senior notes\") at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such series (\"par\"), plus a \"make whole\" premium as described in the indenture in respect to the senior notes and accrued

notes, and on or after december 15, 2059 for the 2060 notes. in addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, as described in the indenture, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the respective note, plus accrued and unpaid interest. in june 2012, with the acquisition of novellus, we assumed $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.625% convertible senior notes due may 2041. we pay cash interest on the 2041 notes at an annual rate of 2.625%, on a semi-annual basis. the 2041 notes may be converted, under certain circumstances, into our common stock. we may redeem the 2041 notes on or after may 21, 2021 at a price equal to outstanding principal plus accrued and unpaid interest if the last reported sales price of common shares has been equal to or more than 150% of the then applicable conversion price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days prior to the redemption notice date. during the quarter-ended june 28, 2020, the market value of our common stock was greater than or equal to 130% of the 2041 notes conversion prices for 20 or more trading days of the 30 consecutive trading days preceding the quarter end. as a result, the 2041 notes are convertible at the option of the holder and are classified as current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets for fiscal year 2020. as of june 28, 2020, $48.5 million of the 2041 notes remain outstanding, as a result of cumulative conversion activity. during fiscal year 2020, 2019, and 2018, we made $668 million, $117 million, and $753 million, respectively, in principal payments on long-term debt and finance/capital leases. revolving credit arrangements on march 12, 2014, the company established an unsecured credit agreement. this agreement was amended on november 10, 2015 (the \"amended and restated credit agreement\"), october 13, 2017 (the \"2nd amendment\"), and february 25, 2019 (the \"3rd amendment\"). under the amended and restated credit agreement (as amended by the 2nd and 3rd amendment), the company has a revolving credit facility of $1.25 billion with a syndicate of lenders with an expansion option that will allow the company, subject to certain requirements, to request an increase in the facility of up to an additional $600 million, for a potential total commitment of $1.85 billion. the facility matures on october 13, 2022. interest on amounts borrowed under the credit facility is, at our option, based on (1) a base rate, defined as the greatest of (a) prime rate, (b) federal funds rate plus 0.5%, or (c) one-month london interbank offered rate (\"libor\") plus 1.0%, plus a spread of 0.0% to 0.5%, or (2) libor multiplied by the statutory reserve rate, plus a spread of 0.9% to 1.5%, in each case as the applicable spread is determined based on the rating of our non-credit enhanced, senior unsecured long-term debt. principal and any accrued and unpaid interest is due and payable upon maturity. additionally, we will pay the lenders a quarterly commitment fee that varies based on our credit rating. the amended credit agreement contains affirmative covenants, negative covenants, financial covenants, and events of default. as of june 28, 2020, we had no borrowings outstanding under the amended credit agreement and were in compliance with all financial covenants. libor is currently expected to be discontinued by the end of calendar year 2021. we expect to amend the amended and restated credit agreement prior to that occurrence to provide for an alternative reference interest continues on next page lam research corporation 2020 10-k rate plus an appropriate spread that approximates the existing reference interest rate as calculated in accordance with libor. despite the current expectations, we cannot be sure when libor is discontinued, that we will be able to reach an agreement with the administrative agent under the amended and restated credit agreement on an alternate reference interest rate plus an appropriate spread, or that changes to the determination of interest under our agreements would approximate the current calculation in accordance with libor. if we should fail to reach agreement with the administrative agent on an alternate reference interest rate prior to such time as libor is unavailable as a reference rate, then the borrowings will bear interest at a base rate determined in accordance with the amended and restated credit agreement tied to either the prime rate or federal funds rate, plus a spread. commercial paper program on november 13, 2017, we established a commercial paper program (the \"cp program\") under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1.25 billion. individual maturities may vary but cannot not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. the net proceeds from the cp program will be used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock from time to time under our stock repurchase program. if at any time, funds are not available under favorable terms under the cp program, we may utilize the amended credit agreement for funding. amounts available under the cp program may be re-borrowed. the cp program is backstopped by our revolving credit arrangement. as of june 28, 2020, we had no outstanding borrowings under the cp program. other guarantees we have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under some of our agreements. we have entered into certain insurance contracts that may limit our exposure to such indemnifications. as of june 28, 2020, we had not recorded any liability on our consolidated financial statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any material amounts under these guarantees. generally, we indemnify, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, our customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our products or services. we seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to our indemnification obligations. we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any material amounts under these guarantees. we provide guarantees and standby letters of credit to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated during the ordinary course of business. as of june 28, 2020, the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these arrangements and letters of credit was $59 million. we do not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be required to be paid. we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, consistent with our bylaws and certificate of incorporation; and under local law, we may be required to provide indemnification to our employees for actions within the scope of their employment. although we maintain insurance contracts that cover some of the potential liability associated with these indemnification agreements, there is no guarantee that all such liabilities will be covered. we do not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be required to be paid under such indemnification agreements or statutory obligations. continues on next page lam research corporation 2020 10-k\"\"\"\n\n    Instruction:\n    Identify and summarize all

IT capability is a firm's ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources in support and enhancement of business strategies and work processes. we focus on information management capability—that is, the ability to provide data and information to users with the appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access and the ability to tailor these in response to changing business needs and directions. at its core, the notion of it capability underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying it-based resources in combination with, and leveraging the value of, other resources and capabilities. it capability, broadly defined as the it function’s competence to effectively support business needs, has become a key in transforming a firm into a competitive force. a firm’s it capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible it resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships,

forward-looking statements\" and \"risk factors\" in this annual report on form 10-k. we use the terms \"accenture,\" \"we,\" the \"company,\" \"our\" and \"us\" in this report to refer to accenture plc and its subsidiaries. all references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on august 31. for example, a reference to \"fiscal 2020\" means the 12-month period that ended on august 31, 2020. all references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. we use the term \"in local currency\" so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. financial results \"in local currency\" are calculated by restating current period activity into u.s. dollars using the comparable prior-year period's foreign currency exchange rates. this approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the u.s. dollar. change in reportable segments effective march 1, 2020, we began managing our business under a new growth model through our three geographic markets, north america, europe and growth markets, which became our reportable segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. prior to this change, our reportable segments were our five industry groups, communications, media & technology, financial services, health & public service, products and resources. for additional information, see our form 8-k filed on january 13, 2020. overview the covid-19 pandemic has caused a significant loss of life, disrupted businesses and restricted travel worldwide, causing significant economic disruption and uncertainty. this disruption and uncertainty has had and continues to have a significant adverse impact on our business, operations and financial results. for fiscal 2020, our revenues grew 3% in u.s. dollars and 4% in local currency, a decrease compared to the revenue growth experienced in fiscal 2019. revenues for the first half of fiscal 2020 grew 7% in u.s. dollars and 8% in local currency compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. on march 11, 2020, the world health organization declared covid-19 a pandemic, and during the second half of fiscal 2020, our revenues declined 1% in u.s. dollars and were flat in local currency compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. the pandemic impacted almost all aspects of our business and forced us to quickly adapt the way we operate. as described below, we took actions to shift the majority of our workforce to a remote working environment to ensure the continuity of our business, including the sales and delivery of services to our clients, and to respond to a rapidly changing demand environment from our clients. as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, we enabled approximately 95% of our global workforce to work from home and suspended substantially all business travel. we continue to develop and implement our comprehensive plan to return to our and our clients' offices where permissible, with our people's safety and the needs of our clients guiding how we manage our phased transition. we experienced reduced demand for our services during the second half of fiscal 2020 as some clients reprioritized and delayed certain work as a result of the pandemic, particularly in the travel, retail, energy, high tech and industrial industries and primarily for our consulting services. we also experienced increased demand in the public service, software & platforms and life sciences industries and from clients across all of our industry groups in connection with their digital transformations, the adoption of cloud technologies and security-related services. in this current market, the level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services while deploying skilled teams of professionals effectively. accenture 2020 form 10-k item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further information on the impact to our results for fiscal 2020, please see \"summary of results\" below. for a discussion of risks related to the covid-19 pandemic, see \"our results of operations have been significantly adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the covid-19 pandemic.\" under item 1a, \"risk factors.\" summary of results revenues for fiscal 2020 increased 3% in u.s. dollars and 4% in local currency compared to fiscal 2019. this included the impact of a decline in reimbursable travel costs, which reduced revenues approximately 1%. during fiscal 2020, revenue growth in local currency was strong in growth markets, solid in north america and flat in europe. we experienced local currency revenue growth that was very strong in health & public service, modest in products, communications, media & technology and financial services and flat in resources. revenue growth in local currency was strong in outsourcing and modest in consulting during fiscal 2020. the business environment remained competitive, and the changes in demand have led to increased pricing pressure, particularly for our consulting services. we use the term \"pricing\" to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell. in our consulting business, revenues for fiscal 2020 were flat in u.s. dollars and increased 2% in local currency compared to fiscal 2019. this included the impact of a decline in reimbursable travel costs, which reduced consulting revenues approximately 2%. consulting revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2020 was led by strong growth in growth markets and modest growth in north america, partially offset by a modest decline in europe. our consulting revenue continues to be driven by digital-, cloud- and security-related services and assisting clients with the adoption of new technologies. in addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses. in our outsourcing business, revenues for fiscal 2020 increased 6% in u.s. dollars and 7% in local currency compared to fiscal 2019. outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2020 was led by strong growth across all geographic markets. we continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with the operation and maintenance of digital-related services and cloud enablement. in addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and cost efficiency. as we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. the majority of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, including the euro, japanese yen, and u.k. pound. there continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results. if the u.s. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in u.s. dollars may be higher. if the u.s. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in u.s. dollars may be lower. the u.s. dollar strengthened against various currencies during fiscal 2020, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and u.s. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 1% lower than our revenue growth in local currency for the year. assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges, we estimate that our fiscal 2021 revenue growth in u.s. dollars will be approximately 2% higher than our revenue growth in local currency. the primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services, sales and marketing and general and administrative costs. cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. general and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs. utilization for fiscal 2020 was 90%, down from 91% in fiscal 2019. we hire to meet current and projected future demand. we proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, increased to approximately 506,000 as of august 31, 2020, compared to approximately 492,000 as of august 31, 2019. the year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions. attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for fiscal 2020 was 12%, down from 17% in fiscal 2019. we evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. in addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. for the majority of our personnel, compensation increases become effective december 1st of each fiscal year. we strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our margin. our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees. accenture 2020 form 10-k item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations gross margin (revenues less cost of services as a percentage of revenues) for fiscal 2020 was 31.5%, compared with 30.8% for fiscal 2019. the increase in gross margin for fiscal 2020 was due to lower non-payroll costs, primarily for travel, partially offset by an increase in labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to fiscal 2019. sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.8% for fiscal 2020, compared with 16.2% for fiscal 2019. for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues increased 10 basis points and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily due to higher technology and facilities costs. operating margin (operating income as a percentage of revenues) for fiscal 2020 was 14.7%, compared with 14.6% for fiscal 2019. during fiscal 2020, we recorded gains of $332 million and $52 million in tax expense related to our investment in duck creek technologies. for additional information, see note 1 (summary of significant accounting policies) to our consolidated financial statements under item 8, \"financial statements and supplementary data.\" the effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was 23.5%, compared with 22.5% for fiscal 2019. absent the $332 million gains on an investment and related $52 million in tax expense, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 would have been 23.9%. diluted earnings per share were $7.89 for fiscal 2020, compared with $7.36 for fiscal 2019. the $280 million gains on an investment, net of taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.43 in fiscal 2020. excluding the impact of these gains, diluted earnings per share would have been $7.46 for fiscal 2020. we have presented our effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding the impact of gains related to an investment in fiscal 2020, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to the impact of this item and our performance in comparison to the prior period. our operating income and diluted earnings per share are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues and costs. most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related revenues. where practical, we seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related revenues, such as the costs associated with our global delivery model, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs. for more information on our hedging programs, see note 9 (financial instruments) to our consolidated financial statements under item 8, \"financial statements and supplementary data.\" bookings new bookings for fiscal 2020 were $49.6 billion, with consulting bookings of $25.8 billion and outsourcing bookings of $23.7 billion, compared to $45.5 billion in fiscal 2019, with consulting bookings of $24.7 billion and outsourcing bookings of $20.8 billion. we provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through acquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts. the types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues. for example, outsourcing bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings. information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. new bookings involve estimates and judgments. there are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. we do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. new bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. the majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in the performance obligations disclosed in note 2 (revenues) to our consolidated financial statements under item 8, \"financial statements and supplementary data.\" accordingly, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations. accenture 2020 form 10-k item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. we continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience. because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. these include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes. revenue recognition determining the method and amount of revenue to recognize requires us to make judgments and estimates. specifically, complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether promised goods and services specified in an arrangement are distinct performance obligations and should be accounted for separately. other judgments include determining whether performance obligations are satisfied over-time or at a point-in-time and the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion. we measure progress towards completion for technology integration consulting services using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. revenues, including estimated fees, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. the amount of revenue recognized for these contracts in a period is dependent on our ability to estimate total contract costs. we continually evaluate our estimates of total contract costs based on available information and experience. additionally, the nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including incentive fees. many contracts include incentives or penalties related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. we conduct reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable. our estimates are monitored over the lives of our contracts and are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance, historical experience and other information available at the time. for additional information, see note 2 (revenues) to our consolidated financial statements under item 8, \"financial statements and supplementary data.\" income taxes on december 22, 2017, the u.s. enacted the tax cuts and jobs act (the \"tax act\"), which significantly changed u.s. tax law. the tax act lowered the u.s. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective january 1, 2018, resulting in a blended u.s. statutory federal income tax rate of 25.7% for our fiscal year ended august 31, 2018 and a u.s. statutory federal income tax rate of 21.0% for our fiscal year ended august 31, 2019. the tax act's \"base erosion and anti-abuse tax\" provision, and regulations issued thereunder, adversely impact our effective tax rate by limiting our ability to deduct certain expenses. determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. as a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly. factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate. we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs. in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs. we release stranded tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive loss using the specific identification approach for our defined benefit plans and the portfolio approach for other items. accenture 2020 form 10-k item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. if future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate. we currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute these indefinitely reinvested earnings. for additional information, see note 11 (income taxes) to our consolidated financial statements under item 8, \"financial statements and supplementary data.\" as a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. we establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. in evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. we evaluate tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax positions are reasonable. however, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for these positions. revenues by segment/geographic market effective march 1, 2020, we began managing our business under a new growth model through our three geographic markets, north america, europe and growth markets, which became our reportable segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. prior to this change, our reportable segments were our five industry groups, communications, media & technology, financial services, health & public service, products and resources. see note 7 (goodwill and intangible assets) and note 16 (segment reporting) to our consolidated financial statements under item 8, \"financial statements and supplementary data\" for further details regarding the change in our reportable segments. in addition to reporting revenues by geographic markets, we also report revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our geographic markets. consulting revenues, which include strategy, management and technology consulting and technology integration consulting, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. outsourcing revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions. from time to time, our geographic markets work together to sell and implement certain contracts. the resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating geographic markets. generally, operating expenses for each geographic market have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. however, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our geographic markets affect revenues and operating expenses within our geographic markets to differing degrees. the mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our geographic markets. local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our geographic markets differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses. while we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and the outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors. accenture 2020 form 10-k item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 effective march 1, 2020, we began managing our

the following revenues commentary discusses local currency revenue changes for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019: geographic markets •north america revenues increased 5% in local currency, led by growth in public service, life sciences, software & platforms, health and banking & capital markets. these increases were partially offset by declines in chemicals & natural resources and high tech. revenue growth was driven by the united states. •europe revenues were flat in local currency, led by growth in life sciences, software & platforms, chemicals & natural resources and health. these increases were partially offset by declines in banking & capital markets, consumer goods, retail & travel services and high tech. revenues were led by growth in italy and germany, partially offset by declines in the united kingdom, spain and france. •growth markets revenues increased 8% in local currency, led by growth in software & platforms, banking & capital markets, public service, chemicals & natural resources, industrial and life sciences. revenue growth was driven by japan, as well as brazil. operating expenses operating expenses for fiscal 2020 increased $903 million, or 2%, over fiscal

2020 increased to 31.5% from 30.8% in fiscal 2019. the increase in gross margin for fiscal 2020 was primarily due to lower non-payroll costs, primarily for travel, partially offset by an increase in labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to fiscal 2019. sales and marketing sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2020 increased $178 million, or 4%, over fiscal 2019, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 10.4% from 10.3% during this period. general and administrative costs general and administrative costs for fiscal 2020 increased $274 million, or 11%, over fiscal 2019, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 6.4% from 5.9% during this period. the increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to higher technology and facilities costs compared to fiscal 2019. operating income and operating margin operating income for fiscal 2020 increased $209 million, or 3%, over fiscal 2019. effective march 1, 2020, we began managing our business under a new growth model through our three geographic markets, north america, europe and growth markets, which became our reportable segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. prior to this change, our reportable segments were our five industry groups, communications, media & technology, financial services, health & public service, products and resources. operating income and operating margin for each of the geographic markets are as follows: fiscal 2020 2019 (in millions of u.s. dollars) operating operating operating operating increase income margin income margin (decrease) north america $3,170 15 %

aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during fiscal 2020 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market. the reduction in travel costs during fiscal 2020 had a favorable impact on operating income. the commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income for fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019: •north america operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower outsourcing contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues. •europe operating income decreased due to lower consulting contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues. •growth markets operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability. accenture 2020 form 10-k item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other income (expense), net other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. during fiscal 2020, other income (expense) increased $342 million over fiscal 2019, primarily due to gains of $332 million related to our investment in duck creek technologies. for additional information, see note 1 (summary of significant accounting policies) to our consolidated financial statements under item 8, \"financial statements and supplementary

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 would have been 23.9%. the higher effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was primarily due to lower benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes and the phased-in effects of u.s. tax reform, partially offset by higher tax benefits from share-based payments. for additional information, see note 11 (income taxes) to our consolidated financial statements

of operations for the year ended august 31, 2018 in item 7 of part ii, \"management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.\" accenture 2020 form 10-k item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities. we could raise additional funds through other public or private debt or equity financings. we may use our available or additional funds to, among other things: •facilitate purchases, redemptions and exchanges of shares and pay dividends; •acquire complementary businesses or technologies; •take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion; or •develop new services and solutions. as of august 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents were $8.4 billion, compared with $6.1 billion as of august 31, 2019. cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our consolidated cash flows statements, are summarized in the following table: fiscal change (in millions of u.s. dollars) 2020 2019 net cash provided by (used in): operating activities $8,215 $6,627 $1,588 investing activities (1,895) (1,756) (139) financing activities (4,049) (3,767) (282) effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 17 (39) 56 net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $2,288 $1,065 $1,223 operating activities: the $1,588 million increase in operating cash flows was due to higher net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities, including higher collections on net client balances (receivables from clients, contract assets and deferred revenues). investing activities: the $139 million increase in cash used was due to higher spending on business acquisitions, partially offset by increased proceeds from investments. for additional information, see note 6 (business combinations) to our consolidated financial statements under item 8, \"financial statements and supplementary data.\" financing activities: the $282 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of shares as well as an increase in cash dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from share issuances. for additional information, see note 14 (shareholders' equity) to our consolidated financial statements under item 8, \"financial statements and supplementary data.\" we believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. in addition, domestic cash inflows for our irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. borrowing facilities see note 10 (borrowings and indebtedness) to our consolidated financial statements under item 8, \"financial statements and supplementary data.\" share purchases and redemptions we intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2021. the number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of accenture canada holdings inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by accenture 2020 form 10-k item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other means. the repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. for additional information, see note 14 (shareholders' equity) to our consolidated financial statements under item 8, \"financial statements and supplementary data.\" subsequent events see note 14 (shareholders' equity) to our consolidated financial statements under item 8, \"financial statements and supplementary data.\" obligations and commitments as of

IT capability is a firm's ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources in support and enhancement of business strategies and work processes. we focus on information management capability—that is, the ability to provide data and information to users with the appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access and the ability to tailor these in response to changing business needs and directions. at its core, the notion of it capability underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying it-based resources in combination with, and leveraging the value of, other resources and capabilities. it capability, broadly defined as the it function’s competence to effectively support business needs, has become a key in transforming a firm into a competitive force. a firm’s it capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible it resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, business process understanding and human resources to further organizational goals.\"\"\"\n\n    Text:\n    \"\"\"item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019 and comparisons between 2020 and 2019. this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes, under item 8 of this form 10-k. comparisons between 2019 and 2018 have been omitted from this form 10-k, but can be found in \"management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\" in part ii, item 7 of our form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019. all comparisons in this discussion are to the corresponding prior year unless otherwise indicated. all dollar amounts are rounded. however, percent changes and ratios are calculated using whole dollars. accordingly, calculations using rounded dollars may differ. md&amp;a index page forward-looking statements overview financial highlights critical accounting estimates consolidated operating results 48 segment operating results 53 net realized and unrealized gains (losses) 61 non-gaap reconciliation 63 net investment income 67 amortization of purchased intangibles and other amortization investments asbestos and environmental (a&amp;e) catastrophe management natural catastrophe property reinsurance program political risk and credit insurance crop insurance liquidity capital resources contractual obligations and commitments credit facilities ratings forward-looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a \"safe harbor\" for forward-looking statements. any written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf may include forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. the words \"believe,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"project,\" \"should,\" \"plan,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"hope,\" \"feel,\" \"foresee,\" \"will likely result,\" \"will continue,\" and variations thereof and similar expressions, identify forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could, should potential events occur, cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. these risks, uncertainties, and other factors, which are described in more detail under part i, item 1a, under risk factors, and elsewhere herein and in other documents we file with the u.s. securities and exchange commission (sec), include but are not limited to: •actual amount of new and renewal business, premium rates, underwriting margins, market acceptance of our products, and risks associated with the introduction of new products and services and entering new markets;

commercial p&c insurance, north america personal p&c insurance, north america agricultural insurance, overseas general insurance, global reinsurance, and life insurance. for more information on our segments refer to \"segment information\" under item 1. we have grown our business through increased premium volume, expansion of product offerings and geographic reach, and acquisitions of other companies. refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for our most recent acquisitions. our product and geographic diversification differentiate us from the vast majority of our competitors and has been a source of stability during periods of industry volatility. our long-term business strategy focuses on sustained growth in book value achieved through a combination of underwriting and investment income. by doing so, we provide value to our clients and shareholders through use of our substantial capital base in the insurance and reinsurance markets. we are organized along a profit center structure by line of business and territory that does not necessarily correspond to corporate legal entities. profit centers can access various legal entities subject to licensing and other regulatory rules. profit centers are expected to generate underwriting income and appropriate risk-adjusted returns. our corporate structure has facilitated the development of management talent by giving each profit center's senior management team the necessary autonomy within underwriting authorities to make operating decisions and create products and coverages needed by its target customer base. we are focused on delivering underwriting profit by only writing policies which we believe adequately compensate us for the risk we accept. our insurance and reinsurance operations generate gross revenues from two principal sources: premiums and investment income. cash flow is generated from premiums collected and investment income received less paid losses and loss expenses, policy acquisition costs, and administrative expenses. invested assets are substantially held in liquid, investment grade fixed income securities of relatively short duration. claims payments in any short-term period are highly unpredictable due to the random nature of loss events and the timing of claims awards or settlements. the value of investments held to pay future claims is subject to market forces such as the level of interest rates, stock market volatility, and credit events such as corporate defaults. the actual cost of claims is also volatile based on loss trends, inflation rates, court awards, and catastrophes. we believe that our cash balance, our highly liquid investments, credit facilities, and reinsurance protection provide sufficient liquidity to meet unforeseen claim demands that might occur in the year ahead. refer to \"liquidity\" and \"capital resources\" for additional information . financial highlights for the year ended december 31, 2020 •net income was $3.5 billion compared with $4.5 billion in 2019, including after-tax catastrophe losses of $2.8 billion compared with $966 million in 2019. •the covid-19 global pandemic and related economic conditions adversely impacted our results of operations and growth in 2020, including: ◦net catastrophe losses included a covid-19 charge of $1,396 million pre-tax ($1,193 million after-tax), generated primarily from entertainment and commercial property-related business interruption, liability insurance products, and workers' compensation. these covid-19 losses added 4.5 percentage points to the p&c combined ratio. ◦net premiums written in consumer lines globally declined by 1.9 percent, or 0.9 percent on a constant-dollar basis, principally reflecting the impact of covid-19. a&h lines experienced negative growth globally and were down 10.6 percent for the year. partially offsetting the decline was our u.s. high net worth personal lines business, which grew 2.8 percent in 2020. •net premiums written were $33.8 billion, up 4.8 percent, or 5.5 percent on a constant-dollar basis with 9.3 percent growth in commercial lines and a decline of 0.9 percent in consumer lines. refer to page 49 for more detail. •net premiums earned were $33.1 billion, up 5.8 percent, or 6.5 percent on a constant-dollar basis with growth in commercial lines of 8.9 percent and consumer lines of 2.5 percent. •p&c combined ratio was 96.1 percent compared with 90.6 percent in 2019. p&c current accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses was 86.7 percent compared with 89.2 percent in 2019. •total pre-tax and after-tax catastrophe losses, including reinstatement premiums, were $3.3 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, compared with $1.2 billion and $966 million, respectively, in 2019. refer to the consolidated operating results section for additional information on our catastrophe losses. •total pre-tax and after-tax favorable prior period development were $395 million (1.2 percentage points of the combined ratio) and $357 million, respectively, compared with $792 million (2.7 percentage points of the combined ratio) and $624 million, respectively, in 2019. •operating cash flow was $9.8 billion compared with $6.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $3.4 billion primarily due to higher premiums collected and reduced payment activity due to the economic slowdown related to covid-19 pandemic. refer to the liquidity section for additional information on our cash flows. •net investment income was $3,375 million compared with $3,426 million in 2019. •share repurchases totaled $516 million, or approximately 3.6 million shares for the year, at an average purchase price of $143.91 per share. •shareholders' equity increased 7.4 percent during the year, principally reflecting strong underlying growth and realized and unrealized gains in our investment portfolio. outlook our premium growth in 2020 reflected increases in commercial p&c lines globally from new business, positive rate increases and higher renewal retention. this growth was tempered by decreases in consumer lines, primarily from outside north america, reflecting the adverse impact of the economic contraction resulting from the covid-19 pandemic. looking forward, we are off to a good start to the year in the first quarter with both growth and the level of commercial p&c rate increases resembling the underwriting conditions of the fourth quarter. we expect the current market condition to continue which will allow us to continue to grow revenue and expand underwriting margins in our commercial lines. for consumer lines, growth globally in the fourth quarter of 2020 continued to be impacted by the pandemic's effects on consumer-related activities. our international personal lines business and our global a&h business together shrank eight percent. we expect growth to return in these businesses as the year progresses. in 2019, chubb entered into agreements to acquire an additional 22.4 percent ownership interest in huatai group through two separate purchases. the first purchase, which was for a 15.3 percent interest, was completed in july 2020. we expect that the second purchase, which was for a 7.1 percent interest, will be completed in the future, contingent upon important conditions. separately, in november 2020, we completed the purchase of an incremental 0.9 percent ownership interest in huatai group, bringing chubb's aggregate ownership interest to 47.1 percent as of december 31, 2020. we continue to apply equity method accounting until we complete the 7.1 percent purchase, which will result in majority ownership at which point we expect to apply consolidation accounting. critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements include amounts that, either by their nature or due to requirements of generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. (gaap), are determined using best estimates and assumptions. while we believe that the amounts included in our consolidated financial statements reflect our best judgment, actual amounts could ultimately materially differ from those currently presented. we believe the items that require the most subjective and complex estimates are: •unpaid loss and loss expense reserves, including long-tail asbestos and environmental (a&e) reserves and non-a&e casualty exposures; •future policy benefits reserves; •the valuation of value of business acquired (voba) and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and voba; •the assessment of risk transfer for certain structured insurance and reinsurance contracts; •reinsurance recoverable, including a valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance; •the valuation of our investment portfolio and assessment of valuation allowance for expected credit losses; •the valuation of deferred income taxes; •the valuation of derivative instruments related to guaranteed living benefits (glb); and •the assessment of goodwill for impairment. we believe our accounting policies for these items are of critical importance to our consolidated financial statements. the following discussion provides more information regarding the estimates and assumptions required to arrive at these amounts and should be read in conjunction with the sections entitled: prior period development, asbestos and environmental (a&e), reinsurance recoverable on ceded reinsurance, investments, and net realized and unrealized gains (losses). unpaid losses and loss expenses as an insurance and reinsurance company, we are required by applicable laws and regulations and gaap to establish loss and loss expense reserves for the estimated unpaid portion of the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses under the terms of our policies and agreements with our insured and reinsured customers. at december 31, 2020, our gross unpaid loss and loss expense reserves were $67.8 billion and our net unpaid loss and loss expense reserves were $53.2 billion. with the exception of certain structured settlements, for which the timing and amount of future claim payments are reliably determinable, and certain reserves for unsettled claims, our loss reserves are not discounted for the time value of money. in connection with such structured settlements and certain reserves for unsettled claims, we carried net discounted reserves of $68 million and $74 million at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the following table presents a roll-forward of our unpaid losses and loss expenses: december 31, 2020 december 31, 2019 (in millions of u.s. dollars) gross losses reinsurance recoverable(1) net losses gross losses reinsurance recoverable(1) net losses balance, beginning of year $62,690 $14,181 $48,509 $62,960 $14,689 $48,271 losses and loss expenses incurred 26,711 5,001 21,710 23,657 4,927 18,730 losses and loss expenses

(1)net of valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. the estimate of the liabilities includes provisions for claims that have been reported but are unpaid at the balance sheet date (case reserves) and for obligations on claims that have been incurred but not reported (ibnr) at the balance sheet date. ibnr may also include provisions to account for the possibility that reported claims may settle for amounts that differ from the established case reserves. loss reserves also include an estimate of expenses associated with processing and settling unpaid claims (loss expenses). our loss reserves comprise approximately 78 percent casualty-related business, which typically encompasses long-tail risks, and other risks where a high degree of judgment is required. the process of establishing loss reserves for property and casualty claims can be complex and is subject to considerable uncertainty as it requires the use of informed estimates and judgments based on circumstances underlying the insured losses known at the date of accrual. for example, the reserves established for high excess casualty claims, asbestos and environmental claims, claims from major catastrophic events, or for our various product lines each require different assumptions and judgments to be made. necessary judgments are based on numerous factors and may be revised as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed, as new or improved methods are developed, or as laws change. hence, ultimate loss payments may differ from the estimate of the ultimate liabilities made at the balance sheet date. changes to our previous estimates of prior period loss reserves impact the reported calendar year underwriting results adversely if our estimates increase or favorably if our estimates decrease. the potential for variation in loss reserve estimates is impacted by numerous factors. reserve estimates for casualty lines are particularly uncertain given the lengthy reporting patterns and corresponding need for ibnr. case reserves for those claims reported by insureds or ceding companies to us prior to the balance sheet date and where we have sufficient information are determined by our claims personnel as appropriate based on the circumstances of the claim(s), standard claim handling practices, and professional judgment. furthermore, for our brandywine run-off operations and our assumed reinsurance operation, global reinsurance, we may adjust the case reserves as notified by the ceding company if the judgment of our respective claims department differs from that of the cedant. with respect to ibnr reserves and those claims that have been incurred but not reported prior to the balance sheet date, there is, by definition, limited actual information to form the case reserve estimate and reliance is placed upon historical loss experience and actuarial methods to estimate the ultimate loss obligations and the corresponding amount of ibnr. ibnr reserve estimates are generally calculated by first projecting the ultimate amount of losses for a product line and subtracting paid losses and case reserves for reported claims. the judgments involved in projecting the ultimate losses may pertain to the use and interpretation of various standard actuarial reserving methods that place reliance on the extrapolation of actual historical data, loss development patterns, industry data, and other benchmarks as appropriate. the estimate of the required ibnr reserve also requires judgment by actuaries and management to reflect the impact of more contemporary and subjective factors, both qualitative and quantitative. among some of these factors that might be considered are changes in business mix or volume, changes in ceded reinsurance structures, changes in claims handling practices, reported and projected loss trends, inflation, the legal environment, and the terms and conditions of the contracts sold to our insured parties. determining management's best estimate our recorded reserves represent management's best estimate of the provision for unpaid claims as of the balance sheet date, and establishing them involves a process that includes collaboration with various relevant parties in the company. for information on our reserving process, refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. sensitivity to underlying assumptions while we believe that our reserve for unpaid losses and loss expenses at december 31, 2020, is adequate, new information or emerging trends that differ from our assumptions may lead to future development of losses and loss expenses that is significantly greater or less than the recorded reserve, which could have a material effect on future operating results. as noted previously, our best estimate of required loss reserves for most portfolios is judgmentally selected for each origin year after considering the results from a number of reserving methods and is not a purely mechanical process. therefore, it is difficult to convey, in a simple and quantitative manner, the impact that a change to a single assumption will have on our best estimate. in the examples below, we attempt to give an indication of the potential impact by isolating a single change for a specific reserving method that would be pertinent in establishing the best estimate for the product line described. we consider each of the following sensitivity analyses to represent a reasonably likely deviation in the underlying assumption. north america commercial p&c insurance - workers' compensation given the long reporting and paid development patterns for workers' compensation business, the development factors used to project actual current losses to ultimate losses for our current exposure require considerable judgment that could be material to consolidated loss and loss expense reserves. specifically, adjusting ground up ultimate losses by a one percentage point change in the tail factor (i.e., 1.04 changed to either 1.05 or 1.03) would cause a change of approximately $910 million, either positive or negative, for the projected net loss and loss expense reserves. this represents an impact of about 9.5 percent relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately $9.6 billion. north america commercial p&c insurance - liability as is the case for workers' compensation above, given the long reporting and paid development patterns, the development factors used to project actual current losses to ultimate losses for our current exposure require considerable judgment that could be material to consolidated loss and loss expense reserves. specifically, for our main u.s. excess/umbrella portfolios, a five percentage point change in the tail factor (e.g., 1.10 changed to either 1.15 or 1.05) would cause a change of approximately $546 million, either positive or negative, for the projected net loss and loss expense reserves. this represents an impact of about 19.7 percent relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately $2.8 billion for these portfolios. the reserve portfolio for our chubb bermuda operations contains exposure to predominantly high excess liability coverage on an occurrence-first-reported basis (typically with attachment points in excess of $325 million and gross limits of up to $150 million) and d&o and other professional liability coverage on a claims-made basis (typically with attachment points in excess of $125 million and gross limits of up to $75 million). due to the layer of exposure covered, the expected frequency for this book is very low. as a result of the low frequency/high severity nature of the book, a small difference in the actual vs. expected claim frequency, either positive or negative, could result in a material change to the projected ultimate loss if such change in claim frequency was related to a policy where close to maximum limits were deployed. north america personal p&c insurance due to the relatively short-tailed nature of many of the coverages involved (e.g., homeowners property damage), most of the incurred losses in personal lines are resolved within a few years of occurrence. as shown in our loss triangle disclosure, the vast majority (approximately 95 percent) of personal lines net ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses are typically paid within five years of the accident date and over 80 percent within two years. even though there are significant reserves associated with some liability exposures such as personal excess/umbrella liability, our incurred loss triangle also shows a roughly consistent pattern of only relatively minor movements in incurred estimates over time by accident year especially after twenty-four months of maturity. while the liability exposures are subject to additional uncertainties from more protracted resolution times, the main drivers of volatility in the personal lines business are relatively short-term in nature and relate to things like natural catastrophes, non-catastrophe weather events, man-made risks, and individual large loss volatility from other fortuitous claim events. north america agricultural insurance approximately 59 percent of the reserves for this segment are from the crop related lines, which all have short payout patterns, with the majority of the liabilities expected to be resolved in the ensuing twelve months. claim reserves for our multiple peril crop insurance (mpci) product are set on a case-by-case basis and our aggregate exposure is subject to state level risk sharing formulae as well as third-party reinsurance. the majority of the development risk arises out of the accuracy of case reserve estimates and the time needed for final crop conditions to be assessed. we do not view our agriculture reserves as substantially influenced by the general assumptions and risks underlying more typical p&c reserve estimates. overseas general insurance certain long-tail lines, such as casualty and professional lines, are particularly susceptible to changes in loss trend and claim inflation. heightened perceptions of tort and settlement awards around the world can increase the demand for these products as well as contributing to the uncertainty in the reserving estimates. our reserving methods rely on loss development patterns estimated from historical data and while we attempt to adjust such factors for known changes in the current tort environment, it is possible that such factors may not entirely reflect all recent trends in tort environments. for example, when applying the reported loss development method, the lengthening of our selected loss development patterns by six months would increase reserve estimates on long-tail casualty and professional lines for accident years 2018 and prior by approximately $590 million. this represents an impact of 15.4 percent relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately $3.8 billion. global reinsurance at december 31, 2020, net unpaid losses and loss expenses for the global reinsurance segment aggregated to $1.5 billion, consisting of $772 million of case reserves and $740 million of ibnr. in comparison, at december 31, 2019, net unpaid losses and loss expenses for the global reinsurance segment aggregated to $1.4 billion, consisting of $769 million of case reserves and $664 million of ibnr. for our catastrophe business, we principally estimate unpaid losses and loss expenses on an event basis by considering various sources of information, including specific loss estimates reported by our cedants, ceding company and overall industry loss estimates reported by our brokers, and our internal data regarding reinsured exposures related to the geographical location of the event. our internal data analysis enables us to establish catastrophe reserves for known events with more certainty at an earlier date than would be the case if we solely relied on reports from third parties to determine carried reserves. for our casualty reinsurance business, we generally rely on ceding companies to report claims and then use that data as a key input to estimate unpaid losses and loss expenses. due to the reliance on claims information reported by ceding companies, as well as other factors, the estimation of unpaid losses and loss expenses for assumed reinsurance includes certain risks and uncertainties that are unique relative to our direct insurance business. these include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: •the reported claims information could be inaccurate; •typically, a lag exists between the reporting of a loss event to a ceding company and its reporting to us as a reinsurance claim. the use of a broker to transmit financial information from a ceding company to us increases the reporting lag. because most of our reinsurance business is produced by brokers, ceding companies generally first submit claim and other financial information to brokers, who then report the proportionate share of such information to each reinsurer of a particular treaty. the reporting lag generally results in a longer period of time between the date a claim is incurred and the date a claim is reported compared with direct insurance operations. therefore, the risk of delayed recognition of loss reserve development is higher for assumed reinsurance than for direct insurance lines; and •the historical claims data for a particular reinsurance contract can be limited relative to our insurance business in that there may be less historical information available. further, for certain coverages or products, such as excess of loss contracts, there may be relatively few expected claims in a particular year so the actual number of claims may be susceptible to significant variability. in such cases, the actuary often relies on industry data from several recognized sources. we mitigate the above risks in several ways. in addition to routine analytical reviews of ceding company reports to ensure reported claims information appears reasonable, we perform regular underwriting and claims audits of certain ceding companies to ensure reported claims information is accurate, complete, and timely. as appropriate, audit findings are used to adjust claims in the reserving process. we also use our knowledge of the historical development of losses from individual ceding companies to adjust the level of adequacy we believe exists in the reported ceded losses. on occasion, there will be differences between our carried loss reserves and unearned premium reserves and the amount of loss reserves and unearned premium reserves reported by the ceding companies. this is due to the fact that we receive consistent and timely information from ceding companies only with respect to case reserves. for ibnr, we use historical experience and other statistical information, depending on the type of business, to estimate the ultimate loss. we estimate our unearned premium reserve by applying estimated earning patterns to net premiums written for each treaty based upon that treaty's coverage basis (i.e., risks attaching or losses occurring). at december 31, 2020, the case reserves, net of retrocessions, reported to us by our ceding companies were $762 million, compared with the $772 million we recorded. our policy is to post additional case reserves in addition to the amounts reported by our cedants when our evaluation of the ultimate value of a reported claim is different than the evaluation of that claim by our cedant. typically, there is inherent uncertainty around the length of paid and reported development patterns, especially for certain casualty lines such as excess workers' compensation or general liability, which may take decades to fully develop. this uncertainty is accentuated by the need to supplement client development patterns with industry development patterns due to the sometimes low statistical credibility of the data. the underlying source and selection of the final development patterns can thus have a significant impact on the selected ultimate net losses and loss expenses. for example, a 20 percent shortening or lengthening of the development patterns used for u.s. long-tail lines would cause the loss reserve estimate derived by the reported bornhuetter-ferguson method for these lines to change by approximately $245 million. this represents an impact of 37 percent relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately $655 million. corporate within corporate, we also have exposure to certain liability reinsurance lines that have been in run-off since 1994. unpaid losses and loss expenses relating to this run-off reinsurance business resides within the brandywine division reported within corporate. most of the remaining unpaid loss and loss expense reserves for the run-off reinsurance business relate to a&e claims. the a&e liabilities principally relate to claims arising from bodily-injury claims related to asbestos products and remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites. the estimation of our a&e liabilities is particularly sensitive to future changes in the legal, social, and economic environment. we have not assumed any such future changes in setting the value of our a&e liabilities, which include provisions for both reported and ibnr claims. there are many complex variables that we consider when estimating the reserves for our inventory of asbestos accounts and these variables may directly impact the predicted outcome. we believe the most significant variables relating to our a&e liabilities include the current legal environment; specific settlements that may be used as precedents to settle future claims; assumptions regarding trends with respect to claim severity and the frequency of higher severity claims; assumptions regarding the ability to allocate liability among defendants (including bankruptcy trusts) and other insurers; the ability of a claimant to bring a claim in a state in which they have no residency or exposure; the ability of a policyholder to claim the right to unaggregated coverage; whether high-level excess policies have the potential to be accessed given the policyholder's claim trends and liability situation; payments to unimpaired claimants; and, the potential liability of peripheral defendants. based on the policies, the facts, the law, and a careful analysis of the impact that these factors will likely have on any given account, we estimate the potential liability for indemnity, policyholder defense costs, and coverage litigation expense. the results in asbestos cases announced by other carriers or defendants may well have little or no relevance to us because coverage exposures are highly dependent upon the specific facts of individual coverage and resolution status of disputes among carriers, policyholders, and claimants. for additional information refer to the \"asbestos and environmental (a&e)\" section and to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. future policy benefits reserves we issue contracts in our overseas general insurance and life insurance segments that are classified as long-duration. these contracts generally include accident and supplemental health products, term and whole life products, endowment products, and annuities. in accordance with gaap, we establish reserves for contracts determined to be long-duration based on approved actuarial methods that include assumptions related to expenses, mortality, morbidity, persistency and investment yields. for traditional long-duration contracts, these assumptions also include a provision for adverse deviation (pad), and are \"locked in\" at the inception of the contract, meaning we use our original assumptions throughout the life of the policy and do not subsequently modify them unless we deem the reserves to be inadequate; while for non-traditional long-duration contracts, the assumptions do not include a pad and are unlocked at each reporting date. the future policy benefits reserves balance is regularly evaluated for a premium deficiency. if experience is less favorable than assumptions, additional liabilities may be required, resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims. valuation of value of business acquired (voba), and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and voba as part of the acquisition of businesses that sell long-duration contracts, such as life products, we established an intangible asset related to voba, which represented the fair value of the future profits of the in-force contracts. the valuation of voba at the time of acquisition is derived from similar assumptions to those used to establish the associated future policy benefits reserves. the most significant input in this calculation is the discount rate used to arrive at the present value of the net cash flows. we amortize deferred policy acquisition costs associated with long-duration contracts and voba (collectively policy acquisition costs) over the estimated life of the contracts, generally in proportion to premium revenue recognized based upon the same assumptions used in estimating the liability for future policy benefits. for non-traditional long-duration contracts, we amortize policy acquisition costs over the expected life of the contracts in proportion to estimates of expected gross profits. the estimated life is established at the inception of the contracts or upon acquisition and is based on current persistency assumptions. policy acquisition costs, which consist of commissions, premium taxes, and certain underwriting costs related directly to the successful acquisition of a new or renewal insurance contract, are reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from future income, including investment income. unrecoverable costs are expensed in the period identified. risk transfer in the ordinary course of business, we both purchase (or cede) and sell (or assume) reinsurance protection. we discontinued the purchase of all finite risk reinsurance contracts, as a matter of policy, in 2002. for both ceded and assumed reinsurance, risk transfer requirements must be met in order to use reinsurance accounting, principally resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract as premiums and losses. if risk transfer requirements are not met, a contract is to be accounted for as a deposit, typically resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract through a deposit asset or liability and not as revenue or expense. to meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance contract must include both insurance risk, consisting of underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity. we also apply similar risk transfer requirements to determine whether certain commercial insurance contracts should be accounted for as insurance or a deposit. contracts that include fixed premium (i.e., premium not subject to adjustment based on loss experience under the contract) for fixed coverage generally transfer risk and do not require judgment. reinsurance and insurance contracts that include both significant risk sharing provisions, such as adjustments to premiums or loss coverage based on loss experience, and relatively low policy limits, as evidenced by a high proportion of maximum premium assessments to loss limits, can require considerable judgment to determine whether or not risk transfer requirements are met. for such contracts, often referred to as finite or structured products, we require that risk transfer be specifically assessed for each contract by developing expected cash flow analyses at contract inception. to support risk transfer, the cash flow analyses must demonstrate that a significant loss is reasonably possible, such as a scenario in which the ratio of the net present value of losses divided by the net present value of premiums equals or exceeds 110 percent. for purposes of cash flow analyses, we generally use a risk-free rate of return consistent with the expected average duration of loss payments. in addition, to support insurance risk, we must prove the reinsurer's risk of loss varies with that of the reinsured and/or support various scenarios under which the assuming entity can recognize a significant loss. to ensure risk transfer requirements are routinely assessed, qualitative and quantitative risk transfer analyses and memoranda supporting risk transfer are developed by underwriters for all structured products. we have established protocols for structured products that include criteria triggering an accounting review of the contract prior to quoting. if any criterion is triggered, a contract must be reviewed by a committee established by each of our segments with reporting oversight, including peer review, from our global structured transaction review committee. with respect to ceded reinsurance, we entered into a few multi-year excess of loss retrospectively-rated contracts, principally in 2002. these contracts primarily provided severity protection for specific product divisions. because traditional one-year reinsurance coverage had become relatively costly, these contracts were generally entered into in order to secure a more cost-effective reinsurance program. all of these contracts transferred risk and were accounted for as reinsurance. in addition, we maintain a few aggregate excess of loss reinsurance contracts that were principally entered into prior to 2003, such as the national indemnity company (nico) contracts referred to in the section entitled, \"asbestos and environmental (a&e)\". we have not purchased any other retroactive ceded reinsurance contracts since 1999. with respect to assumed reinsurance and insurance contracts, products giving rise to judgments regarding risk transfer were primarily sold by our financial solutions business. although we have significantly curtailed writing financial solutions business, several contracts remain in-force and principally include multi-year retrospectively-rated contracts and loss portfolio transfers. because transfer of insurance risk is generally a primary client motivation for purchasing these products, relatively few insurance and reinsurance contracts have historically been written for which we concluded that risk transfer criteria had not been met. for certain insurance contracts that have been reported as deposits, the insured desired to self-insure a risk but was required, legally or otherwise, to purchase insurance so that claimants would be protected by a licensed insurance company in the event of non-payment from the insured. reinsurance recoverable reinsurance recoverable includes balances due to us from reinsurance companies for paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses and is presented net of a valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is determined based upon a review of the financial condition of the reinsurers and other factors. ceded reinsurance contracts do not relieve our primary obligation to our policyholders. consequently, an exposure exists with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer is unable or unwilling to meet its obligations or disputes the liabilities assumed under the reinsurance contracts. we determine the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses using actuarial estimates as well as a determination of our ability to cede unpaid losses and loss expenses under existing reinsurance contracts. the recognition of a reinsurance recoverable asset requires two key judgments. the first judgment involves our estimation based on the amount of gross reserves and the percentage of that amount which may be ceded to reinsurers. ceded ibnr, which is a major component of the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses, is generally developed as part of our loss reserving process and, consequently, its estimation is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimation of gross ibnr (refer to \"critical accounting estimates - unpaid losses and loss expenses\"). the second judgment involves our estimate of the amount of the reinsurance recoverable balance that we may ultimately be unable to recover from reinsurers due to insolvency, contractual dispute, or for other reasons. estimated uncollectible amounts are reflected in a valuation allowance that reduces the reinsurance recoverable asset and, in turn, shareholders' equity. changes in the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance are reflected in net income. although the obligation of individual reinsurers to pay their reinsurance obligations is based on specific contract provisions, the collectability of such amounts requires estimation by management. the majority of the recoverable balance will not be due for collection until sometime in the future, and the duration of our recoverables may be longer than the duration of our direct exposures. over this period of time, economic conditions and operational performance of a particular reinsurer may impact their ability to meet these obligations and while they may continue to acknowledge their contractual obligation to do so, they may not have the financial resources or willingness to fully meet their obligation to us. to estimate the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, the reinsurance recoverable must first be determined for each reinsurer. this determination is based on a process rather than an estimate, although an element of judgment must be applied. as part of the process, ceded ibnr is allocated to reinsurance contracts because ceded ibnr is not generally calculated on a contract by contract basis. the allocations are generally based on premiums ceded under reinsurance contracts, adjusted for actual loss experience and historical relationships between gross and ceded losses. if actual premium and loss experience vary materially from historical experience, the allocation of reinsurance recoverable by reinsurer will be reviewed and may change. while such change is unlikely to result in a large percentage change in the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, it could, nevertheless, have a material effect on our net income in the period recorded. generally, we use a default analysis to estimate uncollectible reinsurance. the primary components of the default analysis are reinsurance recoverable balances by reinsurer, net of collateral, and forward looking default factors used to estimate the probability that the reinsurer may be unable to meet its future obligations in full. in 2020, we adopted new guidance on the accounting for expected credit losses of reinsurance recoverable. for additional information, refer to note 1 s) to the consolidated financial statements under item 8. the definition of collateral for this purpose requires some judgment and is generally limited to assets held in a chubb-only beneficiary trust, letters of credit, and liabilities held by us with the same legal entity for which we believe there is a right of offset. we do not currently include multi-beneficiary trusts. however, we have several reinsurers that have established multi-beneficiary trusts for which certain of our companies are beneficiaries. the determination of the default factor is principally based on the financial strength rating of the reinsurer and a corresponding default factor applicable to the financial strength rating. default factors require considerable judgment and are determined using the current financial strength rating, or rating equivalent, of each reinsurer as well as other key considerations and assumptions. significant considerations and assumptions include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: •for reinsurers that maintain a financial strength rating from a major rating agency, and for which recoverable balances are considered representative of the larger population (i.e., default probabilities are consistent with similarly rated reinsurers and payment durations conform to averages), the judgment exercised by management to determine the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance of each reinsurer is typically limited because the financial rating is based on a published source and the default factor we apply is based on a historical default factor of a major rating agency applicable to the particular rating class. default factors applied for financial ratings of aaa, aa, a, bbb, bb, b, and ccc, are 0.8 percent, 1.2 percent, 1.7 percent, 4.9 percent, 19.6 percent, 34.0 percent, and 62.2 percent, respectively. because our model is predicated on the historical default factors of a major rating agency, we do not generally consider alternative factors. however, when a recoverable is expected to be paid in a brief period of time by a highly-rated reinsurer, such as certain property catastrophe claims, a default factor may not be applied; •for balances recoverable from reinsurers that are both unrated by a major rating agency and for which management is unable to determine a credible rating equivalent based on a parent or affiliated company, we may determine a rating equivalent based on our analysis of the reinsurer that considers an assessment of the creditworthiness of the particular entity, industry benchmarks, or other factors as considered appropriate. we then apply the applicable default factor for that rating class. for balances recoverable from unrated reinsurers for which our ceded reserve is below a certain threshold, we generally apply a default factor of 34.0 percent; •for balances recoverable from reinsurers that are either insolvent or under regulatory supervision, we establish a default factor and resulting valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance based on specific facts and circumstances surrounding each company. upon initial notification of an insolvency, we generally recognize expense for a substantial portion of all balances outstanding, net of collateral, through a combination of write-offs of recoverable balances and increases to the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. when regulatory action is taken on a reinsurer, we generally recognize a default factor by estimating an expected recovery on all balances outstanding, net of collateral. when sufficient credible information becomes available, we adjust the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance by establishing a default factor pursuant to information received; and •for captives and other recoverables, management determines the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance based on the specific facts and circumstances. the following table summarizes reinsurance recoverables and the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance for each type of recoverable balance at december 31, 2020: gross reinsurance recoverables on losses and loss expenses recoverables (net of usable collateral) valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance (1) (in millions of u.s. dollars) type reinsurers with credit ratings $12,479 $10,814 $179 reinsurers not rated 290 154 57 reinsurers under supervision and insolvent reinsurers 64 60 35 captives 2,107 372 11 other - structured settlements and pools 966 965 32 total $15,906 $12,365 $314 (1) the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is based on a default analysis applied to gross reinsurance recoverables, net of approximately $3.5 billion of collateral at december 31, 2020. at december 31, 2020, the use of different assumptions within our approach could have a material effect on the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. to the extent the creditworthiness of our reinsurers was to deteriorate due to an adverse event affecting the reinsurance industry, such as a large number of major catastrophes, actual uncollectible amounts could be significantly greater than our valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. such an event could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and our liquidity. given the various considerations used to estimate our uncollectible valuation allowance, we cannot precisely quantify the effect a specific industry event may have on the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. however, based on the composition (particularly the average credit quality) of the reinsurance recoverable balance at december 31, 2020, we estimate that a ratings downgrade of one notch for all rated reinsurers (e.g., from a to a- or a- to bbb+) could increase our valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance by approximately $81 million or approximately 0.5 percent of the gross reinsurance recoverable balance, assuming no other changes relevant to the calculation. while a ratings downgrade would result in an increase in our valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance and a charge to earnings in that period, a downgrade in and of itself does not imply that we will be unable to collect all of the ceded reinsurance recoverable from the reinsurers in question. refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. fair value measurements accounting guidance defines fair value as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy based on the reliability of the inputs. the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (level 1 inputs) and the lowest priority to unobservable data (level 3 inputs). level 2 includes inputs, other than quoted prices within level 1, that are observable for assets or liabilities either directly or indirectly. refer to note 4 and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for information on our fair value measurements. assessment of investment portfolio credit losses each quarter, we evaluate current expected credit losses (cecl) for fixed maturity securities classified as held to maturity and expected credit losses (ecl) for fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale. because our investment portfolio is the largest component of consolidated assets, cecl and ecl could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. refer to notes 1 e) and 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more information. deferred income taxes at december 31, 2020, our net deferred tax liability was $892 million. our deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily result from temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities. we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities separately for each tax-paying component (an individual entity or group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes) in each tax jurisdiction. the realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax jurisdiction. there may be changes in tax laws in a number of countries where we transact business that impact our deferred tax assets and liabilities. at each balance sheet date, management assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all, or some portion, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the determination of the need for a valuation allowance is based on all available information including projections of future taxable income, principally derived from business plans and where appropriate available tax planning strategies. projections of future taxable income incorporate assumptions of future business and operations that are apt to differ from actual experience. if our assumptions and estimates that resulted in our forecast of future taxable income prove to be incorrect, an additional valuation allowance could become necessary, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. at december 31, 2020, the valuation allowance of $83 million reflects management's assessment that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized due to the inability of certain subsidiaries to generate sufficient taxable income. assumed reinsurance programs involving minimum benefit guarantees under variable annuity contracts chubb reinsures various death and living benefit guarantees associated with variable annuities issued primarily in the united states. we ceased writing this business in 2007. guarantees which are payable on death are referred to as guaranteed minimum death benefits (gmdb). guarantees on living benefits (glb) consist mainly of guaranteed minimum income benefits (gmib). for further description of this product and related accounting treatment, refer to note 1 j) to the consolidated financial statements. guaranteed living benefits (glb) derivatives our glb reinsurance is classified as a derivative for accounting purposes and therefore carried at fair value. changes in fair value are reflected in net realized gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of operations. determination of glb fair value the fair value of glb reinsurance is estimated using an internal valuation model, which includes current market information and estimates of policyholder behavior from the perspective of a theoretical market participant that would assume these liabilities. all of our treaties contain claim limits, which are factored into the valuation model. the fair value depends on a number of factors, including interest rates, equity markets, credit risk, current account value, market volatility, expected annuitization rates and other policyholder behavior, and changes in policyholder mortality. the model and related assumptions are regularly re-evaluated by management and enhanced, as appropriate, based upon additional experience obtained related to policyholder behavior and availability of more timely market information. due to the inherent uncertainties of the assumptions used in the valuation models to determine the fair value of these derivative products, actual experience may differ materially from the estimates reflected in our consolidated financial statements. we intend to hold these derivative contracts to maturity (i.e., the expiration of the underlying liabilities through lapse, annuitization, death, or expiration of the reinsurance contract). to partially offset the risk of changes in the fair value of glb reinsurance contracts, we invest in derivative hedge instruments. for further information on the estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair value of glb reinsurance, refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. for a sensitivity discussion of the effect of changes in interest rates, equity indices, and other assumptions on the fair value of glbs, and the estimated resulting impact on our net income, refer to item 7a. determination of gmdb benefit reserves management established benefit reserves based on a long-term benefit ratio (or loss ratio) calculated using assumptions reflecting management's best estimate of the future performance of the gmdb variable annuity line of business. despite the long-term nature of the risk, the benefit ratio calculation is impacted by short-term market movements that may be judged by management to be transient. management regularly examines both qualitative and quantitative analysis, including a review of the differential between the benefit ratio used at the most recent valuation date and the benefit ratio calculated on subsequent dates. management regularly evaluates its estimates and uses judgment to determine the extent to which assumptions underlying the benefit ratio calculation should be adjusted. for the year ended december 31, 2020, management determined that no change to the benefit ratio was warranted. risk management we employ a strategy to manage the financial market and policyholder behavior risks embedded in the reinsurance of variable annuity (va) guarantees. risk management begins with underwriting a prospective client and guarantee design, with particular focus on protecting our position from policyholder options that, because of anti-selective behavior, could adversely impact our obligation. a second layer of risk management is the structure of the reinsurance contracts. all va guarantee reinsurance contracts include some form of annual or aggregate claim limit(s) primarily designed to reduce our exposure to severe equity market and interest rate declines (which would cause an increase in expected claims). a third layer of risk management is the hedging strategy which looks to mitigate both long-term economic loss over time as well as dampen income statement volatility. we owned financial market instruments as part of the hedging strategy with a fair value liability of $17 million and $13 million at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the instruments are substantially collateralized on a daily basis. we also limit the aggregate amount of variable annuity reinsurance guarantee risk we are willing to assume. the last substantive transactions were quoted in late 2007. the aggregate number of policyholders is currently decreasing through policyholder withdrawals, annuitizations, and deaths at a rate of 5 percent to 15 percent per annum. note that glb claims cannot occur for any reinsured policy until it has reached the end of its \"waiting period\". as of december 31, 2020, 93 percent of the policies we reinsure reached the end of their \"waiting periods\". collateral chubb maintains collateral, including letters of credit (loc), on behalf of most of its clients in the form of qualified assets in trust or letters of credit, typically in an amount sufficient for the client to obtain statutory reserve credit for the reinsurance. the timing of the calculation and amount of the collateral varies by client according to the particulars of the reinsurance treaty and the statutory reserve guidelines of the client's domicile. refer to \"credit facilities\" for a discussion of the loc related to our variable annuity program. goodwill impairment assessment goodwill, which represents the excess of acquisition cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired, was $15.4 billion and $15.3 billion at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. goodwill is assigned to applicable reporting units of acquired entities at the time of acquisition. our reporting units are the same as our reportable segments. for goodwill balances by reporting units, refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. goodwill is not amortized but is subject to a periodic evaluation for impairment at least annually, or earlier if there are any indications of possible impairment. impairment is tested at the reporting unit level. the impairment evaluation first uses a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e., more than a 50 percent probability) that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount. if a reporting unit fails this qualitative assessment, a single quantitative analysis is used to measure and record the amount of the impairment. in assessing the fair value of a reporting unit, we make assumptions and estimates about the profitability attributable to our reporting units, including: •short-term and long-term growth rates; and •estimated cost of equity and changes in long-term risk-free interest rates. if our assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of acquired entities change, we could be required to write-down the carrying value of goodwill which could be material to our results of operations in the period the charge is taken. based on our impairment testing for 2020, we determined no impairment was required and none of our reporting units was at risk for impairment. consolidated operating

respectively, as well as the a&h results of our north america commercial p&c segment, are included in global a&h lines above. the increase in net premiums written in 2020 principally reflects positive growth in commercial p&c lines globally, partially offset by negative growth in consumer p&c lines primarily from outside north america. the increase in net premiums written principally reflected new business, positive rate increases and higher renewal retention. this growth was tempered by the adverse impact of the economic contraction resulting from the covid-19 pandemic, principally in consumer p&c lines. •the growth in commercial casualty was due to new business, positive rate increases and growth in north america, asia and europe, partially offset by the adverse impact of the covid-19 pandemic, including $58 million of exposure adjustments on in-force policies which depressed growth by 1.1 percentage points. •workers' compensation was adversely impacted by market conditions and by the adverse impact of the economic contraction resulting from the covid-19 pandemic. the decrease included $121 million of exposure adjustments on in-force policies which depressed growth by 5.8 percentage points. •the increase in professional liability was due to new business and positive rate increases primarily in north america, asia and europe. •surety decreased in north america and latin america due to market conditions and the adverse impact of the economic contraction resulting from the covid-19 pandemic. •commercial multiple peril increased due to strong renewal retention and positive rate increases in north america. the increase was partially offset by the adverse impact of the economic contraction resulting from the covid-19 pandemic. •property and other short-tail lines increased due to new business and positive rate increases primarily in north america and europe. •personal lines increased primarily due to positive rate increases and strong renewal retention in homeowners business in north america, as well as growth in europe. in addition, north america benefited from the favorable year-over-year impact of reinstatement premiums. the increase was partially offset by the impact of the covid-19 pandemic, which caused declines in automobile business in latin america and north america. •global a&h lines decreased in all regions, principally from less travel volume due to the covid-19 pandemic. •the increase in life was primarily driven by growth in latin america, principally driven by our expanded presence in chile, and in the asian international life operations. for additional information on net premiums written, refer to the segment results discussions. 49 net premiums earned net premiums earned for short-duration contracts, typically p&c contracts, generally reflect the portion of net premiums written that were recorded as revenues for the period as the exposure periods expire. net premiums earned for long-duration contracts, typically traditional life contracts, generally are recognized as earned when due from policyholders. net premiums earned increased $1.8 billion, or $2.0 billion on a constant-dollar basis in 2020, comprising 8.9 percent positive growth in commercial p&c lines and 2.5 percent positive growth in consumer lines on a constant-dollar basis. catastrophe losses and prior period development catastrophe losses exclude reinstatement premiums which are additional premiums paid on certain reinsurance agreements in order to reinstate coverage that had been exhausted by loss occurrences. the reinstatement premium amount is typically a pro rata portion of the original ceded premium paid based on how much of the reinsurance limit had been exhausted. prior period development is net of related adjustments which typically relate to either profit commission reserves or policyholder dividend reserves based on actual claim experience that develops after the policy period ends. the expense adjustments correlate to the prior period loss development on these same policies. refer to the non-gaap reconciliation section for further information on reinstatement premiums on catastrophe losses and adjustments to prior period development. we generally define catastrophe loss events consistent with the definition of the property claims service (pcs) for events in the u.s. and canada. pcs defines a catastrophe as an event that causes damage of $25 million or more in insured losses and affects a significant number of insureds. for events outside of the u.s. and canada, we generally use a similar definition. we also define losses from certain pandemics, such as covid-19, as a catastrophe loss. the tables below represent catastrophe loss estimates for events that occurred in the related calendar year only. changes in catastrophe loss estimates in the current calendar year that relate to loss events that occurred in previous calendar years are considered prior period development and are excluded from the tables below. catastrophe loss charge by event for full year 2020 north america commercial p&amp;c insurance north america personal p&amp;c insurance north america agricultural

molestation claims, predominately reviver statute-related, and $106 million adverse development related to legacy asbestos and environmental liabilities. the remaining favorable development of $760 million principally comprises 89 percent long-tail lines, principally from accident years 2016 and prior, and 11 percent short-tail lines. pre-tax net favorable prior period development for the year ended 2019 was $792 million, which included favorable development of $80 million in our crop insurance business and adverse development of $116 million related to legacy run-off exposures, principally asbestos and environmental liabilities. the remaining favorable development of $828 million comprised 92 percent long-tail lines, principally from accident years 2015 and prior, and 8 percent short-tail lines. refer to the prior period development section in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. p&c combined ratio in evaluating our segments excluding life insurance financial performance, we use the p&c combined ratio, the loss and loss expense ratio, the policy acquisition cost ratio, and the administrative expense ratio. we calculate these ratios by dividing the respective expense amounts by net premiums earned. we do not calculate these ratios for the life insurance segment as we do not use these measures to monitor or manage that segment. the p&c combined ratio is determined by adding the loss and loss expense ratio, the policy acquisition cost ratio, and the administrative expense ratio. a p&c combined ratio under 100 percent indicates underwriting income, and a combined ratio exceeding 100 percent indicates underwriting loss. 2020 2019 2018 loss and loss expense ratio cay loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses 59.2 %

higher catastrophe losses and lower favorable prior period development. the cay loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses decreased 1.6 percentage points in 2020 principally due to a decrease in the underlying loss ratio reflecting earned rate increases exceeding loss cost trends, better underlying claims experience, and a more average crop loss year in 2020. policy acquisition costs consist of commissions, premium taxes, and certain underwriting costs directly related to the successful acquisition of a new or renewal insurance contract. the policy acquisition cost ratio decreased 0.2 percentage points in 2020 due to a change in the mix of business, including less premiums earned from a&h lines that have a lower acquisition cost ratio, reflecting the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. the administrative expense ratio decreased 0.7 percentage points in 2020 primarily due to lower business expenses from continued expense management control, including during the covid-19 pandemic, lower employee benefit-related expenses and the favorable impact of higher net premiums earned. 52 policy benefits policy benefits represent losses on contracts classified as long-duration and generally include accident and supplemental health products, term and whole life products, endowment products, and annuities. refer to the life insurance segment operating results section for further discussion. policy benefits were $784 million, $740 million and $590 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which included separate account liabilities (gains) losses of $58 million, $44 million and $(38) million, respectively. the offsetting movements of these liabilities are recorded in other (income) expense on the consolidated statements of operations. excluding the separate account gains and losses, policy benefits were $726 million in 2020 compared with $696 million, principally from new business from our expanded presence in chile and growth in asia. refer to the respective sections that follow for a discussion of net investment income, other (income) expense, net realized gains (losses), amortization of purchased intangibles, and income tax expense. segment operating results - years ended december 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 we operate through six business segments: north america commercial p&c insurance, north america personal p&c insurance, north america agricultural insurance, overseas general insurance, global reinsurance, and life insurance. in addition, the results of our run-off brandywine business, including all run-off asbestos and environmental (a&e) exposures, and the results of westchester specialty operations for 1996 and prior years are presented within corporate. north america commercial p&c insurance the north america commercial p&c insurance segment comprises operations that provide property and casualty (p&c) and accident & health (a&h) insurance and services to large, middle market, and small commercial businesses in the u.s., canada, and bermuda. this segment includes our north america major accounts and specialty insurance division (large corporate accounts and wholesale business), and the north

points in 2020 primarily due to lower employee benefit-related expenses and lower business expenses from continued expense management control, including during the covid-19 pandemic, partially offset by normal inflationary increases. north america agricultural insurance the north america agricultural insurance segment comprises our north american based businesses that provide a variety of coverages in the u.s. and canada including crop insurance, primarily multiple peril crop insurance (mpci) and crop-hail through rain and hail insurance service, inc.

due to lower than expected mpci losses for the 2019 crop year and a $3 million decrease in net premiums earned related to the mpci profit and loss calculation formula. for 2019, prior period development included $103 million of favorable incurred losses and $13 million of lower acquisition costs due to lower than expected mpci losses for the 2018 crop year, partially offset by a $36 million decrease in net premiums earned related to the mpci profit and loss calculation formula. premiums net premiums written increased $36 million, or 2.0 percent in 2020, primarily due to growth in our chubb agribusiness unit, principally farm and specialty p&c, partly offset by a decrease in mpci premiums. net premiums earned increased $27 million, or 1.5 percent in 2020 reflecting the growth in net premiums written described above. combined ratio the loss and loss expense ratio decreased 5.4 percentage points in 2020, reflecting a more average crop loss year in 2020. in addition, the current year had lower underlying losses in our chubb agribusiness unit, partially offset by lower favorable prior period development. the cay loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses decreased 9.8 percentage points in 2020 reflecting the factors described above. the policy acquisition cost ratio increased 2.1 percentage points in 2020, primarily due to higher agent profit sharing commission in the current year as a result of higher underwriting margin. overseas general insurance overseas general insurance segment comprises chubb international and chubb global markets (cgm). chubb

of 10.8 percent across all regions resulting from new business, retention, and positive rate increases, partially offset by a decline in consumer lines of 6.4 percent. net premiums written in 2020 were depressed by economic contraction resulting from the covid-19 pandemic including $24 million of exposure adjustments on in-force policies, and lower premiums in several lines, mainly in consumer lines in latin america, primarily automobile, and a&h in asia, resulting from less travel volume and lower exposures. net premiums earned increased $403 million in 2020, or $575 million on a constant-dollar basis, reflecting the increase in net premiums written as described above and in 2019. combined ratio the loss and loss expense ratio increased 4.7 percentage points in 2020 due to higher catastrophe losses, primarily related to the covid-19 pandemic. the cay loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses decreased 0.5 percentage points in 2020 primarily due to a decrease in the underlying loss ratio from earned rate changes modestly above loss cost trends and a benefit from lower current accident year losses resulting from a decrease in exposures due to the covid-19 pandemic, partially offset by lower premiums earned from a&h lines in latin america and asia, which have a lower loss ratio. the policy acquisition cost ratio decreased 0.4 percentage points in 2020 primarily due to a change in the mix of business, including less premiums earned from a&h lines that have a lower acquisition cost ratio, reflecting the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. the administrative expense ratio decreased 0.5 percentage points in 2020 primarily due to lower business expenses from continued expense management control, including during the covid-19 pandemic, and the

collected increased $96 million, or $56 million on a constant-dollar basis, in 2020, due to growth in taiwan that more than offset the declines in other asian markets, principally hong kong and korea, as a result of competitive market conditions and the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. life insurance underwriting income and segment income life insurance underwriting income increased $11 million in 2020, primarily due to a favorable reserve development in the current year which more than offset covid-19 related losses of $24 million. segment income increased $35 million primarily due to higher life insurance underwriting income and $26 million of higher other income, principally due to our share of net income from our investment in huatai life, our partially-owned life insurance entity in china. 60 corporate corporate results primarily include the results of our non-insurance companies, income and expenses not attributable to reportable segments and loss and loss expenses of asbestos

molestation claims, predominantly reviver statute-related. refer to note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for further information. administrative expenses decreased $16 million in 2020, primarily due to lower employee benefit-related expenses, and lower travel-related costs relating to the covid-19 pandemic. refer to the respective sections that follow for a discussion of net realized gains (losses), net investment income, other (income) expense, amortization of purchased intangibles, and income tax expense. net realized and unrealized gains (losses) we take a long-term view with our investment strategy, and our investment managers manage our investment portfolio to maximize total return within certain specific guidelines designed to minimize risk. the majority of our investment portfolio is available for sale and reported at fair value. our held to maturity investment portfolio is reported at amortized cost, net of valuation allowance. the effect of market movements on our fixed maturities portfolio impacts net income (through net realized gains (losses)) when securities are sold, when we write down an asset, or when we record a change to the valuation allowance for expected credit losses. for a further discussion related to how we assess the valuation allowance for expected credit losses and the related impact on net income, refer to note 1 e) to the consolidated financial statements. additionally, net income is impacted through the reporting of changes in the fair value of equity securities, private equity funds where we own less than three percent, and derivatives, including financial futures, options, swaps, and glb reinsurance. changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on available for sale securities, resulting from the revaluation of securities held, changes in cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment, and unrealized postretirement benefit obligations liability adjustment, are reported as separate components of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheets. 61 the following table presents our net realized and unrealized gains (losses): year

postretirement programs of $(232) million, $(76) million, and $(321) million for the years ended december 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. the $2,958 million gain in our investment portfolio was principally a result of narrowing of credit spreads in our corporate bond portfolio and a decline in interest rates, partially offset by $170 million of impairments for securities we intended to sell, and securities written to market entering default. the realized losses relating to the variable annuity reinsurance derivative transactions in 2020 and 2019 reflected an increase in the fair value of glb liabilities due to lower interest rates and changes made to our valuation model relating to policyholder behavior, partially offset by higher global equity markets. included in the realized loss are derivative instruments that decrease in fair value when the s&p 500 index increases. during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, we experienced realized losses of $108 million and $138 million respectively, related to these derivative instruments. effective income tax rate our effective income tax rate was 15.1 percent in both 2020 and 2019 and 14.9 percent in 2018. our effective income tax rate reflects a mix of income or losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates, permanent differences between u.s. gaap and local tax laws, and the impact of discrete items. a change in the geographic mix of earnings could impact our effective tax rate. the effective income tax rate in 2020 was impacted by the higher level of catastrophe losses, principally covid-19, and lower realized losses compared to the prior year. the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act (2017 tax act) included provisions for global intangible low-taxed income (gilti) under which taxes may be imposed on income of u.s.-owned foreign subsidiaries and for a base erosion and anti-abuse tax (beat) under which our u.s. companies could be subject to additional tax as a result, among other things, of certain payments to affiliated non-u.s. companies. there remain substantial uncertainties in the interpretation of gilti and beat and portions of the formal guidance issued to date are still in part in proposed form. finalization of the proposed guidance, and changes to the interpretations and assumptions related to these provisions may impact amounts recorded with respect to the international provisions of the 2017 tax act, which may be material in the period the adjustment is recorded. refer to note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. non-gaap reconciliation in presenting our results, we included and discussed certain non-gaap measures. these non-gaap measures, which may be defined differently by other companies, are important for an understanding of our overall results of operations and financial condition. however, they should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). book value per common share, is shareholders' equity divided by the shares outstanding. tangible book value per common share, is shareholders' equity less goodwill and other intangible assets, net of tax, divided by the shares outstanding. we believe that goodwill and other intangible assets are not indicative of our underlying insurance results or trends and make book value comparisons to less acquisitive peer companies less meaningful. the calculation of tangible book value per share does not consider the embedded goodwill attributable to our investments in partially-owned insurance companies until we attain majority ownership and consolidate. we provide financial measures, including net premiums written, net premiums earned, and underwriting income on a constant-dollar basis. we believe it is useful to evaluate the trends in our results exclusive of the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and the currencies in which our international business is transacted, as these exchange rates could fluctuate significantly between periods and distort the analysis of trends. the impact is determined by assuming constant foreign exchange rates between periods by translating prior period results using the same local currency exchange rates as the comparable current period. p&c performance metrics comprise consolidated operating results (including corporate) and exclude the operating results of the life insurance segment. we believe that these measures are useful and meaningful to investors as they are used by management to assess the company's p&c operations which are the most economically similar. we exclude the life insurance segment because the results of this business do not always correlate with the results of our p&c operations. p&c combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss expense ratio, policy acquisition cost ratio and the administrative expense ratio excluding the life business and including the realized gains and losses on the crop derivatives. these derivatives were purchased to provide economic benefit, in a manner similar to reinsurance protection, in the event that a significant decline in commodity pricing impacts underwriting results. we view gains and losses on these derivatives as part of the results of our underwriting operations. cay p&c combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses (cats) excludes cats and prior period development (ppd) from the p&c combined ratio. we exclude cats as they are not predictable as to timing and amount and ppd as these unexpected loss developments on historical reserves are not indicative of our current underwriting performance. the combined ratio numerator is adjusted to exclude cats, net premiums earned adjustments on ppd, prior period expense adjustments and reinstatement premiums on ppd, and the denominator is adjusted to exclude net premiums earned adjustments on ppd and reinstatement premiums on cats and ppd. in periods where there are adjustments on loss sensitive policies, these adjustments are excluded from ppd and net premiums earned when calculating the ratios. we believe this measure provides a better evaluation of our underwriting performance and enhances the understanding of the trends in our p&c business that may be obscured by these items. this measure is commonly reported among our peer companies and allows for a better comparison. reinstatement premiums are additional premiums paid on certain reinsurance agreements in order to reinstate coverage that had been exhausted by loss occurrences. the reinstatement premium amount is typically a pro rata portion of the original ceded premium paid based on how much of the reinsurance limit had been exhausted. net premiums earned adjustments within ppd are adjustments to the initial premium earned on retrospectively rated policies based on actual claim experience that develops after the policy period ends. the premium adjustments correlate to the prior period loss development on these same policies and are fully earned in the period the adjustments are recorded. prior period expense adjustments typically relate to adjustable commission reserves or policyholder dividend reserves based on actual claim experience that develops after the policy period ends. the expense adjustments correlate to the prior period loss development on these same policies. the following tables present the calculation of combined ratio, as reported for each segment to p&c combined ratio, adjusted for catastrophe losses

acquisition in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. net investment income is influenced by a number of factors including the amounts and timing of inward and outward cash flows, the level of interest rates, and changes in overall asset allocation. net investment income decreased 1.5 percent in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to lower reinvestment rates on new and reinvested assets, partially offset by higher average invested assets, higher dividends on public equities, and an increase in income from corporate bonds called before maturity. refer to note 1 e) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. for private equities where we own less than three percent, investment income is included within net investment income in the table above. for private equities where we own more than three percent, investment income is included within other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. excluded from net investment income is the mark-to-market movement for private equities, which is recorded within either other income (expense) or net realized gains (losses) based on our percentage of ownership. the total mark-to-market movement for private equities excluded from net investment income was as follows: (in millions of u.s. dollars) 2020 2019 2018 total mark-to-market gain on private equity, pre-tax $714 $449 $298

publicly traded, investment grade, fixed income securities with an average credit quality of a/aa as rated by the independent investment rating services standard and poor's (s&p)/ moody's investors service (moody's). the portfolio is externally managed by independent, professional investment managers and is broadly diversified across geographies, sectors, and issuers. other investments principally comprise direct investments, investment funds, and limited partnerships. we hold no collateralized debt obligations in our investment portfolio, and we provide no credit default protection. we have long-standing global credit limits for our entire portfolio across the organization. exposures are aggregated, monitored, and actively managed by our global credit committee, comprising senior executives, including our chief financial officer, our chief risk officer, our chief investment officer, and our treasurer. we also have well-established, strict contractual investment rules requiring managers to maintain highly diversified exposures to individual issuers and closely monitor investment manager compliance with portfolio guidelines. the average duration of our fixed income securities, including the effect of options and swaps, was 4.0 years and 3.8 years at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. we estimate that a 100 basis point (bps) increase in interest rates would reduce the valuation of our fixed income portfolio by approximately $4.3 billion at december 31, 2020. we established credit loss valuation allowances as a result of our adoption of guidance on financial instruments - credit losses: measurement of credit losses on financial instruments (cecl) on january 1, 2020. the covid-19 global pandemic and related economic conditions adversely impacted our investment portfolio in the first half of the year. this adverse impact was mitigated by the overall high credit quality of the portfolio and the stabilization of the valuation of securities due to measures announced by the u.s. federal reserve, including programs to support corporate and asset backed securities. overall, the valuation allowance decreased in 2020. refer to notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on expected credit losses. the following table shows the fair value and cost/amortized cost, net of valuation

securities (municipal). we apply the same investment selection process described previously to our municipal investments. the portfolio is highly diversified primarily in state general obligation bonds and essential service revenue bonds including education and utilities (water, power, and sewers). non-u.s. our exposure to the euro results primarily from chubb european group se which is headquartered in france and offers a broad range of coverages throughout the european union, central, and eastern europe. chubb primarily invests in euro denominated investments to support its local currency insurance obligations and required capital levels. chubb's local currency investment portfolios have strict contractual investment guidelines requiring managers to maintain a high quality and diversified portfolio to both sector and individual issuers. investment portfolios are monitored daily to ensure investment manager compliance with portfolio guidelines. our non-u.s. investment grade fixed income portfolios are currency-matched with the insurance liabilities of our non-u.s. operations. the average credit quality of our non-u.s. fixed income securities is a and 48 percent of our holdings are rated aaa or guaranteed by governments or quasi-government agencies. within the context of these investment portfolios, our government and corporate bond holdings are highly diversified across industries and geographies. issuer limits are based on credit rating (aa-two percent, a-one percent, bbb-0.5 percent of the total portfolio) and are monitored daily via an internal compliance system. we manage our indirect exposure using the same credit rating based investment approach. accordingly, we do not believe our indirect exposure is material. 70 the following table summarizes the

below-investment grade corporate fixed income portfolio below-investment grade securities have different characteristics than investment grade corporate debt securities. risk of loss from default by the borrower is greater with below-investment grade securities. below-investment grade securities are generally unsecured and are often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer. also, issuers of below-investment grade securities usually have higher levels of debt and are more sensitive to adverse economic conditions, such as recession or increasing interest rates, than investment grade issuers. at december 31, 2020, our corporate fixed income investment portfolio included below-investment grade and non-rated securities which, in total, comprised approximately 15 percent of our fixed income portfolio. our below-investment grade and non-rated portfolio includes over 1,400 issuers, with the greatest single exposure being $176 million. we manage high-yield bonds as a distinct and separate asset class from investment grade bonds. the allocation to high-yield bonds is explicitly set by internal management and is targeted to securities in the upper tier of credit quality (bb/b). our minimum rating for initial purchase is bb/b. fourteen external investment managers are responsible for high-yield security selection and portfolio construction. our high-yield managers have a conservative approach to credit selection and very low historical default experience. holdings are highly diversified across industries and generally subject to a 1.5 percent issuer limit as a percentage of high-yield allocation. we monitor position limits daily through an internal compliance system. derivative and structured securities (e.g., credit default swaps and collateralized loan obligations) are not permitted in the high-yield portfolio. asbestos and environmental (a&e) asbestos and environmental (a&e) reserving considerations for asbestos, chubb faces claims relating to policies issued to manufacturers, distributors, installers, and other parties in the chain of commerce for asbestos and products containing asbestos. claimants will generally allege damages across an extended time period which may coincide with multiple policies covering a wide range of time periods for a single insured. environmental claims present exposure for remediation and defense costs associated with the contamination of property as a result of pollution. the following table presents count information for asbestos claims by causative agent and environmental claims by account, for direct policies only: asbestos (by causative agent) environmental (by account) 2020 2019 2020 2019 open at beginning of year 1,724 1,838 1,217 1,361 newly reported/reopened 192 173 130 140 closed or otherwise disposed 193 287 113 284 open at end of year 1,723 1,724 1,234 1,217 survival ratios are calculated by dividing the asbestos or environmental loss and allocated loss adjustment expense (alae) reserves by the average asbestos or environmental loss and alae payments for the three most recent calendar years (3-year survival ratio). the 3-year survival ratios for gross and net asbestos loss and alae reserves were 5.9 years and 6.3 years, respectively. the 3-year survival ratios for gross and net environmental loss and alae reserves were 4.9 years and 25.5 years, respectively. the net 3-year survival ratios were impacted by favorable reinsurance settlements in 2018. excluding the settlements, the 3-year survival ratio for net asbestos loss and alae reserves and net environmental loss and alae reserves were 6.0 years and 5.2 years, respectively. the survival ratios provide only a very rough depiction of reserves and are significantly impacted by a number of factors such as aggressive settlement practices, variations in gross to ceded relationships within the asbestos or environmental claims, and levels of coverage provided. therefore, we urge caution in using these very simplistic ratios to gauge reserve adequacy. 72 catastrophe management we actively monitor and manage our catastrophe risk accumulation around the world, including setting risk limits based on probable maximum loss (pml) and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance. the table below presents our modeled pre-tax estimates of natural catastrophe pml, net of reinsurance, at december 31, 2020, for worldwide, u.s. hurricane and california earthquake events, based on our in-force portfolio at october 1, 2020 and reflecting the april 1, 2020 reinsurance program (see natural catastrophe property reinsurance program section) as well as inuring reinsurance protection coverages. according to the model, for the 1-in-100 return period scenario, there is a one percent chance that our pre-tax annual aggregate losses incurred in any year from u.s. hurricane events could be in excess of $2,725 million (or 4.6 percent of our total shareholders' equity at december 31, 2020). these estimates assume that reinsurance recoverable is fully collectible. modeled net probable maximum loss (pml) pre-tax worldwide (1) u.s. hurricane (2) california earthquake (3) annual aggregate annual

(3) california earthquakes include fire-following perils. the above estimates of chubb's loss profile are inherently uncertain for many reasons, including the following: •while the use of third-party catastrophe modeling packages to simulate potential hurricane and earthquake losses is prevalent within the insurance industry, the models are reliant upon significant meteorology, seismology, and engineering assumptions to estimate catastrophe losses. in particular, modeled catastrophe events are not always a representation of actual events and ensuing additional loss potential; •there is no universal standard in the preparation of insured data for use in the models, the running of the modeling software and interpretation of loss output. these loss estimates do not represent our potential maximum exposures and it is highly likely that our actual incurred losses would vary materially from the modeled estimates; •the potential effects of climate change add to modeling complexity; and •changing climate conditions could impact our exposure to natural catastrophe risks, including u.s. hurricane. published studies by leading government, academic and professional organizations predict an increase in the expected annual frequency of atlantic-basin hurricanes and sea level rise through the end of the century over observed historical averages. these studies contemplate expected multi-decadal impacts of climate change on sea surface temperatures, sea levels and other factors contributing to the frequency and intensity of hurricanes. based on preliminary stress tests conducted against the chubb portfolio, the impacts of climate change are not expected to materially impact our reported u.s. hurricane pml over the next 12 months. these tests reflect current exposures only and excludes potential mitigating factors, such as changes to building codes, public or private risk mitigation, regulation and public policy. natural catastrophe property reinsurance program chubb's core property catastrophe reinsurance program provides protection against natural catastrophes impacting its primary property operations (i.e., excluding our global reinsurance and life insurance segments). we regularly review our reinsurance protection and corresponding property catastrophe exposures. this may or may not lead to the purchase of additional reinsurance prior to a program's renewal date. in addition, prior to each renewal date, we consider how much, if any, coverage we intend to buy and we may make material changes to the current structure in light of various factors, including modeled pml assessment at various return periods, reinsurance pricing, our risk tolerance and exposures, and various other structuring considerations. chubb renewed its global property catastrophe reinsurance program for our north american and international operations effective april 1, 2020 through march 31, 2021, with no material changes in coverage from the expiring program. the program consists of three layers in excess of losses retained by chubb on a per occurrence basis. in addition, chubb also renewed its terrorism coverage (excluding nuclear, biological, chemical and radiation coverage, with an inclusion of coverage for biological and chemical coverage for personal lines) for the united states from april 1, 2020 through march 31, 2021 with the same limits and retention and percentage placed except that the majority of terrorism coverage is on an aggregate basis above our retentions without a reinstatement. loss location layer of loss comments notes united states $0 million - $1.0 billion losses retained by chubb (a) (excluding alaska and hawaii) united states $1.0 billion -$1.15 billion all natural perils and terrorism (b) (excluding alaska and hawaii) united states $1.15 billion -$2.15 billion all natural perils and terrorism (c) (excluding alaska and hawaii) united states $2.15 billion -$3.5 billion all natural perils and terrorism (d) (excluding alaska and hawaii) international $0 million -$175 million losses retained by chubb (a) (including alaska and hawaii) international $175 million -$1.175 billion all natural perils and terrorism (c) (including alaska and hawaii) alaska, hawaii, and canada $1.175 billion - $2.525 billion all natural perils and terrorism (d) (a) ultimate retention will depend upon the nature of the loss and the interplay between the underlying per risk programs and certain other catastrophe programs purchased by individual business units. these other catastrophe programs have the potential to reduce our effective retention below the stated levels. (b) these coverages are partially placed with reinsurers. (c) these coverages are both part of the same second layer within the global catastrophe program and are fully placed with reinsurers. (d) these coverages are both part of the same third layer within the global catastrophe program and are fully placed with reinsurers. political risk and credit insurance political risk insurance is a specialized coverage that provides clients with protection against unexpected, catastrophic political or macroeconomic events, primarily in emerging markets. we participate in this market through our bermuda based wholly-owned subsidiary sovereign risk insurance ltd. (sovereign), and through a unit of our london-based cgm operation. chubb is one of the world's leading underwriters of political risk and credit insurance, has a global portfolio spread across more than 150 countries and is also a member of the berne union. our clients include financial institutions, national export credit agencies, leading multilateral agencies, private equity firms and multinational corporations. cgm writes political risk and credit insurance business out of underwriting offices in london, united kingdom; hamburg, germany; sao paulo, brazil; singapore; tokyo, japan; and in the u.s. in the following locations: chicago, new york, los angeles and washington, d.c. our political risk insurance products provide protection to commercial lenders against defaults on cross border loans, covers investors against equity losses, and protects exporters against defaults on contracts. commercial lenders, our largest client segment, are covered for missed scheduled loan repayments due to acts of confiscation, expropriation or nationalization by the host government, currency inconvertibility or exchange transfer restrictions, or war or other acts of political violence. in addition, in the case of loans to government-owned entities or loans that have a government guarantee, political risk policies cover scheduled payments against risks of non-payment or non-honoring of government guarantees. private equity investors and corporations cover their equity investments against financial losses, such as expropriatory events, inability to repatriate dividends, and physical damage to their operations caused by covered political risk events. our export contracts product provides coverage for both exporters and their financing banks against the risk of contract frustration due to government actions, including non-payment by governmental entities. cgm's credit insurance businesses cover losses due to insolvency, protracted default, and political risk perils including export and license cancellation. our credit insurance product provides coverage to larger companies that have sophisticated credit risk management systems, with exposure to multiple customers and that have the ability to self-insure losses up to a certain level through excess of loss coverage. it also provides coverage to trade finance banks, exporters, and trading companies, with exposure to trade-related financing instruments. cgm also has limited capacity for specialist credit insurance products which provide coverage for project finance and working capital loans for large corporations and banks. we have implemented structural features in our policies in order to control potential losses within the political risk and credit insurance businesses. these include basic loss sharing features such as co-insurance and deductibles, and in the case of trade credit, the use of non-qualifying losses that drop smaller exposures deemed too difficult to assess. ultimate loss severity is also limited by using waiting periods to enable the insurer and insured to mitigate losses and to agree on recovery strategies if a claim does materialize. we have the option to pay claims over the original loan repayment schedule, rather than in a lump sum, in order to provide insureds and the insurer additional time to remedy problems and work towards full recoveries. it is important to note that political risk and credit policies are named peril conditional insurance contracts, not financial guarantees, and claims are only paid after conditions and warranties are fulfilled. political risk and credit insurance policies do not cover currency devaluations, bond defaults, movements in overseas equity markets, transactions deemed illegal, situations where corruption or misrepresentation has occurred, or debt that is not legally enforceable. in addition to assessing and mitigating potential exposure on a policy-by-policy basis, we also have specific risk management measures in place to manage overall exposure and risk. these measures include placing country, credit, and individual transaction limits based on country risk and credit ratings, combined single loss limits on multi-country policies, the use of quota share and excess of loss reinsurance protection as well as quarterly modeling and stress-testing of the portfolio. we have a dedicated country and credit risk management team that are responsible for the portfolio. crop insurance we are, and have been since the 1980s, one of the leading writers of crop insurance in the u.s. and have conducted that business through a managing general agent subsidiary of rain and hail. we provide protection throughout the u.s. on a variety of crops and are therefore geographically diversified, which reduces the risk of exposure to a single event or a heavy accumulation of losses in any one region. our crop insurance business comprises two components - multiple peril crop insurance (mpci) and crop-hail insurance. the mpci program, offered in conjunction with the u.s. department of agriculture's risk management agency (rma), is a federal subsidized insurance program that covers revenue shortfalls or production losses due to natural causes such as drought, excessive moisture, hail, wind, freeze, insects, and disease. these revenue products are defined as providing both commodity price and yield coverages. policies are available for various crops in different areas of the u.s. and generally have deductibles generally ranging from 10 percent to 50 percent of the insured's risk. the usda's risk management agency (rma) sets the policy terms and conditions, rates and forms, and is also responsible for setting compliance standards. as a participant in the mpci program, we report all details of policies to the rma and are party to a standard reinsurance agreement (sra). the sra sets out the relationship between private insurance companies and the federal crop insurance corporation (fcic) concerning the terms and conditions regarding the risks each will bear including the pro-rata and state stop-loss provisions, which allows companies to limit the exposure of any one state or group of states on their underwriting results. in addition to the pro-rata and excess of loss reinsurance protections inherent in the sra, we also purchase third-party proportional and stop-loss reinsurance for our mpci business to reduce our exposure. we may also enter into crop derivative contracts to further manage our risk exposure. each year the rma issues a final sra for the subsequent reinsurance year (i.e., the 2021 sra covers the 2021 reinsurance year from july 1, 2020 through june 30, 2021). there were no significant changes in the terms and conditions from the 2020 sra and therefore, the new sra does not impact chubb's outlook on the crop program relative to 2021. we recognize net premiums written as soon as estimable on our mpci business, which is generally when we receive acreage reports from the policyholders on the various crops throughout the u.s. this allows us to best determine the premium associated with the liability that is being planted. the mpci program has specific timeframes as to when producers must report acreage to us and in certain cases, the reporting occurs after the close of the respective reinsurance year. once the net premium written has been recorded, the premium is then earned over the growing season for the crops. a majority of the crops that are covered in the program are typically subject to the sra in effect at the beginning of the year. given the major crops covered in the program, we typically see a substantial written and earned premium impact in the second and third quarters. the pricing of mpci premium is determined using a number of factors including commodity prices and related volatility (i.e., both impact the amount of premium we can charge to the policyholder). for example, in most states, the pricing for the mpci revenue product for corn (i.e., insurance coverage for lower than expected crop revenue in a given season) includes a factor based on the average commodity price in february. if corn commodity prices are higher in february, compared to the february price in the prior year, and all other factors are the same, the increase in price will increase the corn premium year-over-year. pricing is also impacted by volatility factors, which measure the likelihood commodity prices will fluctuate over the crop year. for example, if volatility is set at a higher rate compared to the prior year, and all other factors are the same, the premium charged to the policyholder will be higher year-over-year for the same level of coverage. losses incurred on the mpci business are determined using both commodity price and crop yield. with respect to commodity price, there are two important periods on a large portion of the business: the month of february when the initial premium base is set, and the month of october when the final harvest price is set. if the price declines from february to october, with yield remaining at normal levels, the policyholder may be eligible to recover on the policy. however, in most cases there are deductibles on these policies, therefore, the impact of a decline in price would have to exceed the deductible before a policyholder would be eligible to recover. we evaluate our mpci business at an aggregate level and the combination of all of our insured crops (both winter and summer) go into our underwriting gain or loss estimate in any given year. typically, we do not have enough information on the harvest prices or crop yield outputs to quantify the preliminary estimated impact to our underwriting results until the fourth quarter. our crop-hail program is a private offering. premium is earned on the crop-hail program over the coverage period of the policy. given the very short nature of the growing season, most crop-hail business is typically written in the second and third quarters and the recognition of earned premium is also more heavily concentrated during this timeframe. we use industry data to develop our own rates and forms for the coverage offered. the policy primarily protects farmers against yield reduction caused by hail and/or fire, and related costs such as transit to storage. we offer various deductibles to allow the grower to partially self-insure for a reduced premium cost. we limit our crop-hail exposures through the use of township liability limits and third-party reinsurance on our net retained hail business. liquidity liquidity is a measure of a company's ability to generate cash flows sufficient to meet short-term and long-term cash requirements. as a holding company, chubb limited possesses assets that consist primarily of the stock of its subsidiaries and other investments. in addition to net investment income, chubb limited's cash flows depend primarily on dividends and other statutorily permissible payments. historically, dividends and other statutorily permitted payments have come primarily from chubb's bermuda-based operating subsidiaries, which we refer to as our bermuda subsidiaries. our consolidated sources of funds consist primarily of net premiums written, fees, net investment income, and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. funds are used at our various companies primarily to pay claims, operating expenses, and dividends; to service debt; to purchase investments; and to fund acquisitions. we anticipate that positive cash flows from operations (underwriting activities and investment income) should be sufficient to cover cash outflows under most loss scenarios for the near term. should the need arise, we generally have access to capital markets and available credit facilities. refer to \"credit facilities\" below for additional information. our access to funds under the existing credit facility is dependent on the ability of the bank that is a party to the facility to meet its funding commitments. should our existing credit provider experience financial difficulty, we may be required to replace credit sources, possibly in a difficult market. if we cannot obtain adequate capital or sources of credit on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. to date, we have not experienced difficulty accessing our credit facility. to further ensure the sufficiency of funds to settle unforeseen claims, we hold certain invested assets in cash and short-term investments. in addition, for certain insurance, reinsurance, or deposit contracts that tend to have relatively large and reasonably predictable cash outflows, we attempt to establish dedicated portfolios of assets that are duration-matched with the related liabilities. with respect to the duration of our overall investment portfolio, we manage asset durations to both maximize return given current market conditions and provide sufficient liquidity to cover future loss payments. at december 31, 2020, the average duration of our fixed maturities (4.0 years) is less than the average expected duration of our insurance liabilities (4.7 years). despite our safeguards, if paid losses accelerate beyond our ability to fund such paid losses from current operating cash flows, we might need to either liquidate a portion of our investment portfolio or arrange for financing. potential events causing such a liquidity strain could include several significant catastrophes occurring in a relatively short period of time, large uncollectible reinsurance recoverables on paid losses (as a result of coverage disputes, reinsurers' credit problems, or decreases in the value of collateral supporting reinsurance recoverables) or increases in collateral postings under our variable annuity reinsurance business. because each subsidiary focuses on a more limited number of specific product lines than is collectively available from the chubb group of companies, the mix of business tends to be less diverse at the subsidiary level. as a result, the probability of a liquidity strain, as described above, may be greater for individual subsidiaries than when liquidity is assessed on a consolidated basis. if such a liquidity strain were to occur in a subsidiary, we could be required to liquidate a portion of our investments, potentially at distressed prices, as well as be required to contribute capital to the particular subsidiary and/or curtail dividends from the subsidiary to support holding company operations. the payment of dividends or other statutorily permissible distributions from our operating companies are subject to the laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction, as well as the need to maintain capital levels adequate to support the insurance and reinsurance operations, including financial strength ratings issued by independent rating agencies. during 2020, we were able to meet all our obligations, including the payments of dividends on our common shares, with our net cash flows. we assess which subsidiaries to draw dividends from based on a number of factors. considerations such as regulatory and legal restrictions as well as the subsidiary's financial condition are paramount to the dividend decision. chubb limited received dividends of $1.9 billion and $200 million from its bermuda subsidiaries in 2020 and 2019, respectively. chubb limited also received cash dividends of $110 million and non-cash dividends of $734 million from a swiss subsidiary in 2020. there were no dividends received in 2019. the payment of any dividends from cgm or its subsidiaries is subject to applicable u.k. insurance laws and regulations. in addition, the release of funds by syndicate 2488 to subsidiaries of cgm is subject to regulations promulgated by the society of lloyd's. chubb limited received no dividends from cgm in 2020 and 2019. the u.s. insurance subsidiaries of chubb ina holdings inc. (chubb ina) may pay dividends, without prior regulatory approval, subject to restrictions set out in state law of the subsidiary's domicile (or, if applicable, commercial domicile). chubb ina's international subsidiaries are also subject to insurance laws and regulations particular to the countries in which the subsidiaries operate. these laws and regulations sometimes include restrictions that limit the amount of dividends payable without prior approval of regulatory insurance authorities. chubb limited received no dividends from chubb ina in 2020 and 2019. debt issued by chubb ina is serviced by statutorily permissible distributions by chubb ina's insurance subsidiaries to chubb ina as well as other group resources. chubb ina received dividends of $1.2 billion and $3.7 billion from its subsidiaries in 2020 and 2019, respectively. at december 31, 2020, the amount of dividends available to be paid to chubb ina in 2021 from its subsidiaries without prior approval of insurance regulatory authorities totals $2.7 billion. cash flows our insurance and reinsurance operations provide liquidity in that premiums are received in advance, sometimes substantially in advance, of the time claims are paid. generally, cash flows are affected by claim payments that, due to the nature of our operations, may comprise large loss payments on a limited number of claims and which can fluctuate significantly from period to period. the irregular timing of these loss payments can create significant variations in cash flows from operations between periods. refer to \"contractual obligations and commitments\" for our estimate of future claim payments by period. sources of liquidity include cash from operations, routine sales of investments, and financing arrangements. the following is a discussion of our cash flows for 2020, 2019, and 2018. operating cash flows reflect net income for each period, adjusted for non-cash items and changes in working capital. operating cash flows were $9.8 billion in 2020, compared to $6.3 billion and $5.5 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively. operating cash flow increased $3.5 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, principally reflecting higher premiums collected and reduced payment activity due to the economic slowdown related to covid-19 pandemic. cash used for investing was $7.5 billion in 2020, compared to $5.9 billion and $2.9 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively. the current year included payment, including a deposit, of $1.6 billion for the purchase of an additional 16.2 percent ownership in huatai group. this compares to the prior year purchase of an additional 10.9 percent ownership interest in huatai group for $580 million. refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. in addition, the current year included higher private equity contributions, net of distributions received, of $1.1 billion. cash used for financing was $2.1 billion in 2020, compared to $151 million and $2.0 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively. cash used for financing was higher by $1.9 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt (net of repayments) of $2.6 billion, partially offset by fewer shares repurchased in the current year. refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on share repurchases. both internal and external forces influence our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. claim settlements, premium levels, and investment returns may be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions. in many cases, significant periods of time, ranging up to several years or more, may lapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us, and the settlement of the liability for that loss. we use repurchase agreements as a low-cost funding alternative. at december 31, 2020, there were $1.4 billion in repurchase agreements outstanding with various maturities over the next eight months. in addition to cash from operations, routine sales of investments, and financing arrangements, we have agreements with a third-party bank provider which implemented two international multi-currency notional cash pooling programs to enhance cash management efficiency during periods of short-term timing mismatches between expected inflows and outflows of cash by currency. the programs allow us to optimize investment income by avoiding portfolio disruption. in each program, participating chubb entities establish deposit accounts in different currencies with the bank provider. each day the credit or debit balances in every account are notionally translated into a single currency (u.s. dollars) and then notionally pooled. the bank extends overdraft credit to all participating chubb entities as needed, provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in each pool at the end of each day is at least zero. actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between legal entities. chubb entities may incur overdraft balances as a means to address short-term liquidity needs. any overdraft balances incurred under this program by a chubb entity would be guaranteed by chubb limited (up to $300 million in the aggregate). our syndicated letter of credit facility allows for same day drawings to fund a net pool overdraft should participating chubb entities withdraw contributed funds from the pool. capital resources capital resources consist of funds deployed or available to be deployed to support our business operations. december 31 december 31 (in millions of u.s. dollars, except for percentages) 2020 2019 short-term debt $-

above and are disclosed separately from short-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets. the repurchase agreements are collateralized borrowings where we maintain the right and ability to redeem the collateral on short notice, unlike short-term debt which comprises the current maturities of our long-term debt instruments. on september 17, 2020, chubb ina issued $1.0 billion of 1.375 percent senior notes due september 2030. chubb ina's $1.3 billion of 2.3 percent senior notes due november 2020 was paid upon maturity. refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for details about the debt issued and debt redeemed. we believe our financial strength provides us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain available funds externally through debt or equity financing on both a short-term and long-term basis. our ability to access the capital markets is dependent on, among other things, market conditions and our perceived financial strength. we have accessed both the debt and equity markets from time to time. we generally maintain the ability to issue certain classes of debt and equity securities via an unlimited securities and exchange commission (sec) shelf registration which is renewed every three years. this allows us capital market access for refinancing as well as for unforeseen or opportunistic capital needs. in october 2018, we filed an unlimited shelf registration which allows us to issue certain classes of debt and equity. this shelf registration expires in october 2021. securities repurchases from time to time, we repurchase shares as part of our capital management program. the board of directors (board) has authorized share repurchase programs as follows: •$1.0 billion of chubb common shares from january 1, 2018 through december 31, 2018 •$1.5 billion of chubb common shares from december 1, 2018 through december 31, 2019 •$1.5 billion of chubb common shares from november 21, 2019 through december 31, 2020 •$1.5 billion of chubb common shares from november 19, 2020 through december 31, 2021 subsequently, in february 2021, the board approved an increase to the november 2020 share repurchase program of $1.0 billion to a total of $2.5 billion, effective through december 31, 2021. share repurchases may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, block trades, accelerated repurchases and/or through option or other forward transactions. in 2020, 2019, and 2018 we repurchased $516 million, $1.53 billion, and $1.02 billion, respectively, of common shares in a series of open market transactions under the board share repurchase authorizations. on april 22, 2020, we suspended share repurchases, given the economic environment and to preserve capital for both risk and opportunity. subsequently we announced and then resumed share repurchases on october 29, 2020. the $1.5 billion november 2019 authorization remained effective through december 31, 2020. repurchases through december 31, 2020 were made under this authorization. for the period january 1 through february 24, 2021, we repurchased 1,971,000 common shares for a total of $327 million in a series of open market transactions under the share repurchase program authorized in november 2020. at february 24, 2021, $2.17 billion in share repurchase authorization remained through december 31, 2021. common shares our common shares had a par value of chf 24.15 each at december 31, 2020. as of december 31, 2020, there were 26,872,639 common shares in treasury with a weighted average cost of $135.58 per share. under swiss law, dividends must be stated in swiss francs though dividend payments are made by chubb in u.s. dollars. at our may 2019 annual general meeting, our shareholders approved an annual dividend for the following year of up to $3.00 per share, which was paid in four quarterly installments of $0.75 per share at dates determined by the board after the annual general meeting by way of distribution from capital contribution reserves, transferred to free reserves for payment. at our may 2020 annual general meeting, our shareholders approved an annual dividend for the following year of up to $3.12 per share, expected to be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.78 per share after the annual general meeting by way of distribution from capital contribution reserves, transferred to free reserves for payment. the board will determine the record and payment dates at which the annual dividend may be paid until the date of the 2021 annual general meeting, and is authorized to abstain from distributing a dividend at its discretion. the first three quarterly installments each of $0.78 per share, have been distributed by the board as expected. dividend distributions on common shares amounted to chf 2.89 ($3.09) per share for the year ended december 31, 2020. refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our dividends. contractual

(3)funding commitment primarily related to limited partnerships. the timing of the payments of these commitments is uncertain and may differ from the estimated timing in the table. (4)subject to foreign exchange fluctuations on interest expense and principal. the contractual obligations and commitments table excludes the following items: •pension obligations: minimum funding requirements for our pension obligations are immaterial. subsequent funding commitments are apt to vary due to many factors and are difficult to estimate at this time. refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. •liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits: the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and offsetting tax credits, was $76 million at december 31, 2020. at december 31, 2020, we had accrued $16 million in liabilities for income tax-related interest and penalties in our consolidated balance sheet. other than settlement of a liability in january 2021 for $23 million, including interest, we are unable to make a reliable estimate for the timing of cash settlement of these liabilities. refer to note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. we have no other significant contractual obligations or commitments not reflected in the table above. we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. estimated gross loss payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts we are obligated to pay claims under insurance and reinsurance contracts for specified loss events covered under those contracts. such loss payments represent our most significant future payment obligation as a p&c insurance and reinsurance company. in contrast to other contractual obligations, cash payments are not determinable from the terms specified within the contract. for example, we do not ultimately make a payment to our counterparty for many insurance and reinsurance contracts (i.e., when a loss event has not occurred) and if a payment is to be made, the amount and timing cannot be determined from the contract. in the table above, we estimate payments by period relating to our gross liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses included in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2020, and do not take into account reinsurance recoverable. these estimated loss payments are inherently uncertain and the amount and timing of actual loss payments are likely to differ from these estimates and the differences could be material. given the numerous factors and assumptions involved in both estimates of loss and loss expense reserves and related estimates as to the timing of future loss and loss expense payments in the table above, differences between actual and estimated loss payments will not necessarily indicate a commensurate change in ultimate loss estimates. the liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses presented in our balance sheet is discounted for certain structured settlements, for which the timing and amount of future claim payments are reliably determinable, and certain reserves for unsettled claims. our loss reserves are not discounted for the time value of money. accordingly, the estimated amounts in the table exceed the liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses presented in our balance sheet. refer to note 1 h) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. estimated payments for future policy benefits we establish reserves for future policy benefits for life, long-term health, and annuity contracts. the amounts in the table are gross of fees or premiums due from the underlying contracts. the liability for future policy benefits for life, long-term health, and annuity contracts presented in our balance sheet is discounted and reflected net of fees or premiums due from the underlying contracts. accordingly, the estimated amounts in the table exceed the liability for future policy benefits presented in our balance sheet. payment amounts related to these reserves must be estimated and are not determinable from the contract. due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing and amount of these payments, actual results could materially differ from the estimates in the table. credit facilities as our bermuda subsidiaries are non-admitted insurers and reinsurers in the u.s., the terms of certain u.s. insurance and reinsurance contracts require them to provide collateral, which can be in the form of letters of credit (locs). locs may also be used for general corporate purposes. should the need arise, we generally have access to capital markets and to credit facilities with letter of credit capacity of $4.0 billion with a sub-limit of $1.9 billion for revolving credit. at december 31, 2020, our usage under these facilities was $1.7 billion in locs, of which $1.1 billion related to our variable annuity reinsurance program. our access to credit under these facilities is dependent on the ability of the banks that are a party to the facilities to meet their funding commitments. should the existing credit providers on these facilities experience financial difficulty, we may be required to replace credit sources, possibly in a difficult market. if we cannot obtain adequate capital or sources of credit on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. to date, we have not experienced difficulty accessing our credit facilities or establishing additional facilities when needed. in the event we are required to provide alternative security to clients, the security could take the form of additional insurance trusts supported by our investment portfolio or funds withheld using our cash resources. the value of locs required is driven by, among other things, statutory liabilities reported by variable annuity guarantee reinsurance clients, loss development of existing reserves, the payment pattern of such reserves, the expansion of business, and loss experience of such business. the facilities noted above require that we maintain certain financial covenants, all of which have been met at december 31, 2020. these covenants include: (i)a minimum consolidated net worth of not less than $34.985 billion; and (ii)a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization of not greater than 0.35 to 1. at december 31, 2020, (a) the minimum consolidated net worth requirement under the covenant described in (i) above was $34.985 billion and our actual consolidated net worth as calculated under that covenant was $56.6 billion and (b) our ratio of debt to total capitalization, as calculated under the covenant which excludes the fair value adjustment of debt acquired through the chubb corp acquisition, was 0.20 to 1, which is below the maximum debt to total capitalization ratio of 0.35 to 1 as described in (ii) above. our failure to comply with the covenants under any credit facility would, subject to grace periods in the case of certain covenants, result in an event of default. this could require us to repay any outstanding borrowings or to cash collateralize locs under such facility. our failure to repay material financial obligations, as well as our failure with respect to certain other events expressly identified, would result in an event of default under the facility. ratings chubb limited and its subsidiaries are assigned credit and financial strength (insurance) ratings from internationally recognized rating agencies, including s&p, a.m. best, moody's, and fitch. the ratings issued on our companies by these agencies are announced publicly and are available directly from the agencies. our internet site (investors.chubb.com, under shareholder resources/rating agency ratings) also contains some information about our ratings, but such information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this report. financial strength ratings reflect the rating agencies' opinions of a company's claims paying ability. independent ratings are one of the important factors that establish our competitive position in the insurance markets. the rating agencies consider many factors in determining the financial strength rating of an insurance company, including the relative level of statutory surplus necessary to support the business operations of the company. these ratings are based upon factors relevant to policyholders, agents, and intermediaries and are not directed toward the protection of investors. such ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities. credit ratings assess a company's ability to make timely payments of principal and interest on its debt. it is possible that, in the future, one or more of the rating agencies may reduce our existing ratings. if one or more of our ratings were downgraded, we could incur higher borrowing costs, and our ability to access the capital markets could be impacted. in addition, our insurance and reinsurance operations could be adversely impacted by a downgrade in our financial strength ratings, including a possible reduction in demand for our products in certain markets. also, we have insurance and reinsurance contracts which contain rating triggers. in the event the s&p or a.m. best financial strength ratings of chubb fall, we may be faced with the cancellation of premium or be required to post collateral on our underlying obligation associated with this premium. we estimate that at december 31, 2020, a one-notch downgrade of our s&p or a.m. best financial strength ratings would result in an immaterial loss of premium or requirement for collateral to be posted.\"\"\"\n\n    Instruction:\n    Identify and summarize all

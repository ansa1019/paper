Bank of America takes a comprehensive approach to managing risk and enhancing organizational resilience through its defined risk framework and articulated risk appetite, overseen by the board and the enterprise risk committee, which annually review and approve the strategic plan, capital plan, financial operating plan and risk appetite statement. Senior management and the management‐level risk committee execute an integrated evaluation of risk, earnings, capital and liquidity, while front‐line units and specialized control functions independently assess and monitor all operational, compliance, credit, market, liquidity and reputational risks. The corporation maintains extensive contingency planning, including a financial contingency and recovery plan to guide capital, liquidity and risk‐mitigating actions under stress scenarios, a resolution plan to limit systemic impacts, and business continuity policies, standards and procedures supported by operational resiliency capabilities to maintain critical operations through a range of conditions, including cybersecurity incidents. Diversified funding sources, centralized liquidity management and regular stress testing analyses enable the firm to absorb strain and preserve functioning under challenging conditions. Dedicated enterprise model risk, compliance and operational risk teams, together with corporate audit, provide independent oversight of processes, controls and third‐party dependencies, ensuring the alignment of response mechanisms necessary to adapt and maintain performance under unexpected situations.

In 2023, faced with macroeconomic headwinds, inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions and volume diversion associated with labor negotiations, the company demonstrated its capacity for positive adjustment under challenging conditions by continuing to execute its “customer first, people led and innovation driven” strategy—enhancing customer engagement through digital capabilities, acquiring MNX Global Logistics and Happy Returns, opening a state-of-the-art UPS Velocity Fulfillment Center and planning a new air hub in Hong Kong—to reconfigure its network, reach new markets and better serve its customer base. Recognizing the need for operational flexibility and resource reallocation, management took actions “intended to right-size our business for the future” by exploring strategic alternatives for its truckload brokerage business, reducing headcount through its “fit to serve” initiative, optimizing its capital structure, and redeploying resources within supply chain solutions toward higher-growth healthcare logistics and digital businesses while winding down transition services for the UPS Freight divestiture. Despite higher year-over-year labor costs and volume declines, the company maintained industry-leading service levels, regained approximately 60 percent of diverted U.S. volume following ratification of its Teamsters agreement, and expects moderate volume and revenue growth in the second half of 2024 as global economic conditions gradually improve. Capital expenditures were focused on network enhancement projects, sustainability objectives and technology initiatives, financed through cash from operations, commercial paper programs and disciplined debt management to ensure business continuity. At the same time, the company reinforced its systemic resilience by monitoring and recalibrating actuarial estimates for self-insurance reserves, pension and postretirement obligations, conducting impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived trade names, updating useful lives and residual values of long-lived assets, and maintaining an agile risk-assessment process—measures that collectively reflect its ability to absorb strain, adapt to internal or external disturbances and preserve performance under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

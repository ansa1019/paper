In fiscal 2023, the company navigated supply chain constraints by leveraging operational disciplines to fulfill nearly all outstanding back orders in the second half of the year, demonstrating adaptability and continuity under external pressures. It launched a restructuring plan to realign its cost structure with market outlook, including workforce reductions, relocation of manufacturing activities to existing facilities, inventory and equipment transfers, and the exit of select supplier arrangements, reflecting strategic reconfiguration to preserve operational performance. The company continues to invest in business process improvements, with projected expenditures of $250 million for enhancements and restructuring-related initiatives, while balancing customer requirements with resource availability and exercising discretion in product manufacturing and delivery timing to maintain performance under demand fluctuations. Liquidity management remains a core resilience strategy, with cash, cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash totaling $5.6 billion at year-end and anticipated operating cash flows expected to support its operations, R&D and capital infrastructure investments, debt service, capital redistributions, and dividends for at least the next twelve months; however, it recognizes that global economic uncertainty, semiconductor industry volatility, trade restrictions, supply chain challenges, and inflationary pressures could impair customer demand and its ability to manage commercial relationships. To mitigate these risks, the company maintains substantial liquidity reserves, continually assesses its ability to access capital markets for additional funding if needed, and conducts systematic reviews of inventory valuation, warranty provisions, deferred tax assets, and long-lived asset impairments, ensuring that resources are realigned and performance is preserved under both nominal and adverse conditions.

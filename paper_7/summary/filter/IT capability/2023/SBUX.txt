In fiscal 2023, Starbucks’s management underscored the strength and resilience of its brand as evidenced by a 12 percent increase in consolidated revenues to $36.0 billion and a 200 basis point expansion in operating margin, driven by pricing, sales leverage and in‐store operational efficiencies; strategic investments in store partner wages, benefits and training have increased retention and operational efficiencies, while purpose-built store concepts and technology innovations have provided additional convenience and customer connection. In the U.S. reinvention plan announced in fiscal 2022, the company committed to elevating efficiency and the partner and customer experience, anticipating moderation of inflationary pressures and continued benefits from increased sales leverage, pricing decisions and operational efficiencies. Internationally, despite COVID-19 pandemic headwinds in China, revenue grew 8 percent, driven by net new store openings and higher product sales and royalty revenues from licensees, offset partially by unfavorable foreign currency translation, demonstrating the company’s ability to absorb strain from external disturbances and preserve functioning. The channel development segment’s 3 percent revenue growth, gain on sale of assets and joint venture income further reflect diversified resilience strategies. Starbucks actively manages cash and investments to internally fund operating needs, service debt, invest in core businesses and return capital to shareholders, maintaining liquidity through a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility, a $3.0 billion commercial paper program and various yen-denominated credit lines. The company employs commodity and foreign exchange hedging policies, including fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts and derivative instruments, to mitigate volatility in green coffee, dairy and currency markets, while prohibiting speculative trading and limiting counterparty credit risk. These market price risk management strategies, along with disciplined capital allocation, dynamic portfolio management and strategic foresight, support Starbucks’s maintenance of performance and integrity under internal and external variations, reinforcing its capacity to adapt, sustain business continuity and pursue sustainable, profitable growth over the long term.

Management performed rationalization activities to identify duplicative network and backhaul services, decommission certain small cell sites and distributed antenna systems, terminate or accelerate operating and financing leases for network equipment and retire legacy networks, resulting in a significant decrease in network decommissioning costs and enabling synergy realization while preserving network integrity. Following the merger, restructuring initiatives—including contract terminations for retail store and distribution channel rationalization, severance for redundant processes and functions and small cell site decommissioning—have been implemented to achieve cost efficiencies and operational flexibility. A workforce reduction of approximately 5,000 positions further realigned resources to meet strategic objectives. Macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, such as potential recessions, monetary policy shifts and conflicts, are continuously monitored to assess credit loss activity and fair value estimates, with fixed‐rate contracts and limited exposure to interest‐rate fluctuations providing stability. Liquidity is supported by cash and equivalents, operating cash flows, receivable securitizations, a $7.5 billion revolving credit facility and a $2.0 billion commercial paper program, together with proceeds from long‐term debt issuances, ensuring access to capital for continued network build-out, spectrum acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt refinancing, dividend payments and share repurchases. Strategic investments include $9.3 billion in C-band spectrum licenses from Auction 107, 2.5 GHz licenses from Auction 108 and $3.5 billion in 600 MHz license purchase agreements subject to regulatory approval, each enhancing network capacity and competitive positioning. Off-balance sheet arrangements to sell EIP and service receivables augment financial adaptability. Detailed contractual obligations, including long-term debt maturities, interest schedules, lease commitments and purchase obligations, support forward planning and system resilience. Critical accounting judgments, such as estimating useful lives for depreciation and evaluating deferred tax assets, reflect internal knowledge and risk assessment to maintain financial integrity under diverse conditions, collectively underscoring the company’s ability to absorb strain, preserve functioning and reconfigure trajectories toward future performance under challenging conditions.

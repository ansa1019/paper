Management reported that global supply chain disruptions, while improved in 2023, continued to impose constraints and inflationary pressures on raw materials, components and distribution, prompting increased costs and efforts to maintain manufacturing and distribution continuity. To enhance operational flexibility and business continuity, the company reorganized its operational structure in early 2022 by aggregating core businesses into two reportable segments—Medsurg and Cardiovascular—thereby reconfiguring its portfolio to better support market dynamics. In February 2023, a new global restructuring program was approved to simplify the manufacturing and distribution network by transferring production lines among facilities, optimize functional capabilities to achieve cost synergies, and drive operational efficiencies and resiliency; this initiative is estimated to incur $450-550 million of pre-tax charges, yield $225-275 million of annual expense reductions and reinvest savings into strategic growth initiatives. Strategic acquisitions of Acotec Scientific, Apollo Endosurgery, Relievant MedSystems and Baylis Medical, together with targeted divestitures, underscored the company’s ability to absorb strain, deploy resources, and preserve performance under evolving conditions, while contingent consideration adjustments reflected adaptive risk assessment and milestone‐based resource allocation. Proactive investments in research and development to sustain innovation pipelines, along with regulatory compliance efforts for the EU Medical Device Regulation—incurring $340 million to date and projected total costs of $450-500 million—demonstrate the firm’s commitment to risk mitigation, adaptation to external pressures and maintenance of integrity amid regulatory change. Financial resilience is bolstered by diversified liquidity sources, including $865 million of unrestricted cash, market-diversified short-term investments, a $2.75 billion revolving credit facility extended to 2027 with SOFR-based rates, and access to capital markets that supported the early extinguishment and refinancing of debt; these measures, combined with periodic reassessments of emerging markets and ESG initiatives to reduce energy consumption and achieve carbon neutrality by 2030, reflect the organization’s ability to foresee, confront and benefit from disruptive change, transform itself in response to adversity and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

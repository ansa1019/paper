In fiscal 2023, our ability to generate $21.2 billion of cash flow from operations and access $2.0 billion of long-term debt, together with cash on hand, underpinned our capacity to fund $8.4 billion of dividends, $8.0 billion of share repurchases, $3.2 billion of capital expenditures, and $1.5 billion of acquisitions while repaying $1.3 billion of long-term debt, demonstrating resource deployment to preserve functioning under financial pressures; our current cash position, operational cash flow, funds available under our $5.0 billion commercial paper program with back-up credit facilities and access to the long-term debt capital markets should be sufficient not only for operating requirements and contractual obligations but also to enable us to invest in the business, fund dividends and share repurchases through the next several fiscal years, with the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing if necessary; we follow a disciplined approach to capital allocation that prioritizes investing in the business, followed by paying dividends and returning excess cash to shareholders, and we may adjust capital expenditures to support operations, enhance long-term strategic positioning or respond to the economic environment as appropriate; inventory levels normalized in fiscal 2023 as we adjusted purchasing activity to align with demand and continued to sell through existing inventory, reducing year-over-year shrink pressures and reflecting operational flexibility and risk mitigation; our senior note issuances and indentures that do not limit additional indebtedness further support liquidity resilience; operating and finance leases provide real estate flexibility for stores, distribution centers and support centers; legally binding purchase obligations and unrecognized tax benefits are managed to mitigate financial risk; changes in working capital—driven by lower inventory purchases and timing of vendor payments—contributed to a $6.6 billion increase in net cash provided by operating activities, illustrating our capability to reconfigure resources and maintain performance under varying economic conditions; strategic investments in new store openings, technology and differentiated capabilities strengthen our competitive positioning and enable adaptation to macroeconomic shifts, commodity deflation and evolving consumer trends; overall, these financial and operational policies and actions demonstrate our ability to absorb strain, maintain integrity and preserve or improve performance in the face of external disturbances and challenging conditions.

In 2023, AMD successfully launched multiple leadership products across its data center, embedded, client and gaming businesses and advanced its AI strategy through the integration of cross-functional teams and strategic acquisitions of Mipsology SAS and Nod, Inc., thereby reconfiguring resources to absorb strain and maintain or improve performance under mixed demand and market volatility. Against a backdrop of a 4% decline in consolidated net revenue driven by weakened client and gaming demand and offset by growth in embedded and data center segments, the company preserved gross margin expansion by shifting product mix, reducing acquisition-related intangible amortization and intensifying R&D investments to support innovation and future orientation. AMD’s liquidity and capital resource management—with $5.8 billion in cash and short-term investments, a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, a commercial paper program and ongoing supplier payment and delivery timing adjustments—underpins operational continuity, risk mitigation and resilience to environmental disruptions. The company’s reliance on critical accounting estimates—including variable consideration under ASC 606, inventory valuation at the lower of cost or net realizable value, qualitative and quantitative impairment tests for goodwill and long-lived assets, and deferred tax asset recoverability—demonstrates proactive adjustment of key assumptions for actual historical activity, current economic conditions and known events, reflecting organizational flexibility and systemic resilience. Additionally, AMD’s strategic share repurchase program, disciplined capital expenditures and sustained investment in emerging technologies further illustrate its capacity to allocate resources dynamically, support evolving trajectories and preserve competitive advantage amid turbulent markets.

The Company emphasizes its commitment to maintaining operational continuity and adaptability by empowering enterprises, organizations, service providers, and government entities to protect themselves against today’s most sophisticated cyber threats, “help secure enterprise users, networks, clouds, and endpoints by delivering comprehensive cybersecurity backed by industry-leading artificial intelligence and automation,” and offering “zero trust solutions, starting with next-generation zero trust network access to secure today’s remote hybrid workforces and extending to securing all users, applications, and infrastructure with zero trust principles.”  Its security solutions are designed “to reduce customers’ total cost of ownership by improving operational efficiency and eliminating the need for siloed point products,” reflecting an integrated, systemic approach to resilience.  The Company further demonstrates its capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning through sustained investments in innovation, noting that “innovation and timely development of new features and products are essential to meeting the needs of our end-customers and improving our competitive position,” including recent platform enhancements and targeted acquisitions, and by acknowledging that “to manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner.”  Management monitors and mitigates external pressures—“we continue to experience supply chain disruption and incur increased costs resulting from inflationary pressures” and “we are monitoring the tensions between China and Taiwan, and between the U.S. and China, which could have an adverse impact on our business or results of operations in future periods”—while tracking key resilience indicators such as deferred revenue, “because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods,” billings, “a key metric used by management to manage our business” and gauge “the health and visibility of our business,” and cash flow metrics—“we monitor cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of our overall business performance” and free cash flow “to provide useful information … about the amount of cash generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures.”  Cash provided by operating activities of $2.8 billion in fiscal 2023 supports the Company’s view that “our cash flow from operations with existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.”  Financial flexibility is further enhanced by a new $400 million unsecured revolving credit facility with sustainability-linked pricing terms, ongoing management of convertible senior notes, and a Board-authorized $3.3 billion share repurchase program funded from available working capital, all of which underwrite the Company’s ability to adapt, reconfigure resources, and maintain performance under variable and challenging conditions.

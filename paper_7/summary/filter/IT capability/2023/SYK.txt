In response to persistent inflationary pressures, global supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and geopolitical conflicts, Stryker maintained positive adjustment under challenging conditions by achieving 11.1% net sales growth (11.6% in constant currency, excluding acquisitions and divestitures) through increased unit volumes, strategic pricing actions and higher shipments across all product lines, while preserving operational continuity via its long-term capital allocation strategy of targeted acquisitions ($390 million in 2023), dividends ($1,139 million) and share repurchases. The company’s ability to absorb strain and maintain performance integrity under adverse internal and external variations was further supported by disciplined resource deployment—early extinguishment of debt, issuance of senior unsecured notes, and sustained investment-grade debt ratings—resulting in $3,711 million of cash from operations, $3,053 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and current assets exceeding current liabilities by $4,597 million at year-end. Stryker’s systemic resilience mechanisms included continuous monitoring and mitigation of manufacturing and supply chain cost inflation and inefficiencies, the execution of structural optimization and integration-related activities, rigorous impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets (notably a $216 million spine reporting unit goodwill charge in 2022 followed by a 10% fair-value recovery assessment in 2023), proactive legal, recall and tax provisioning based on best estimates of probable losses, and robust liquidity management through commercial paper and revolving credit facilities. By aligning resource management, risk assessment and strategic foresight with critical accounting policies governing deferred tax assets and liabilities, Stryker sustained its organizational health and competitive position, demonstrating multifaceted resilience, adaptability and continuity across nominal, extreme and exceptional conditions.

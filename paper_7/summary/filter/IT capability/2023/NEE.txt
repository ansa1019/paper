Nextera Energy and its principal businesses employ a range of regulatory, financial and operational mechanisms to absorb strain and preserve performance under demanding conditions, including FPL’s use of reserve amortization under the 2021 rate agreement and interim storm restoration charges approved by the Florida PSC to recover approximately $1.3 billion of eligible storm costs from Hurricanes Ian and Nicole, cost recovery clauses that pass through fuel and storm‐related surcharges, and maintenance of a regulatory ROE of approximately 11.8 percent to sustain targeted returns; NEER’s deployment of diversified investments in new wind, solar and battery storage capacity, its use of non-qualifying commodity hedges and adjusted earnings measures to mitigate volatility in energy, fuel, interest-rate and currency markets, and its backlog of contracted renewable projects; the maintenance of robust liquidity and capital resources through cash flows from operations, cash collateral, borrowings under syndicated and bilateral credit facilities, letters of credit, capital support guarantees and standby surety bonds, all supported by strong investment-grade credit ratings and replacement-capital covenants; the funding of long-lived asset retirement obligations and nuclear decommissioning reserve funds invested in fixed-income and equity securities to ensure future restoration capabilities; the application of derivative instruments, master netting agreements and credit enhancements to manage counterparty credit and market risk; and well-funded pension arrangements based on actuarial assumptions that avoid near-term cash contributions—all of which collectively support the maintenance of system integrity, operational flexibility, business continuity and the capacity to reconfigure trajectories toward emerging stronger from disruptive events.

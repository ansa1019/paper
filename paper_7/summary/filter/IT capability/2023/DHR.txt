The company’s MD&A discloses that its geographic and industry diversity, as well as the range of its products and services, “help mitigate the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country … on its consolidated operating results,” reflecting an organizational design to absorb external disturbances and preserve performance. Management’s discussion and analysis “is designed to focus specifically on material events and uncertainties known to management that are reasonably likely to cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results or of future financial condition,” serving as a risk assessment and preparedness mechanism. The company “is making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions and investments, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources … in order to be responsive to the company’s customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the company’s operations,” illustrating resource reconfiguration and operational flexibility. Reporting non-GAAP measures such as core sales growth “provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends … and facilitates comparisons … with peers,” and management “uses these non-GAAP financial measures to measure the company’s operating and financial performance and uses core sales (decline) growth as one of the performance measures in the company’s executive short-term cash incentive program,” evidencing systemic performance monitoring. The ongoing application of the Danaher Business System (“continuing productivity improvement initiatives”) highlights organizational practices for cost efficiency and adaptability when core sales decline. Government financing agreements to expand bioprocessing and diagnostics capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic, together with the use of a $5.0 billion revolving credit facility, commercial paper programs and a “well-known seasoned issuer” shelf registration, demonstrate strategic tools for liquidity continuity and business continuity under market volatility. The company “manages interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and at times variable-rate debt” and “has used foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency swaps to hedge a portion of its net investments in non-U.S. operations,” while credit risk is mitigated by performing customer credit evaluations and limiting concentration, all of which illustrate mechanisms to maintain system integrity, reconfigure financial resources and preserve performance under internal and external pressures.

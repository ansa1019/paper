ServiceNow’s intelligent Now Platform unifies and digitizes workflows by connecting disparate departments, systems and silos in a seamless way to unlock productivity and improve experiences for both employees and customers, and the transformation to digital operations enabled by the Now Platform increases our customers’ resiliency and security. We are closely monitoring external disruptions such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the conflict in Israel and the Gaza Strip, rising interest rates, global inflation and bank failures, and to mitigate associated risk our cash and cash equivalents are distributed across several large financial institutions and are not concentrated in one institution, subject to policy restrictions on available-for-sale debt securities and portfolio concentration limits. We enter into foreign currency derivative contracts with maturities of 12 months or less to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities, and although these hedging contracts may reduce, they cannot entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements. With $8.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and investments and more than ten years of positive operating cash flows, we anticipate that our liquidity will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next twelve months and to continue growing free cash flow to fund operations and strategic investments, and if necessary we may seek additional equity or debt financing. Subscription services arrangements typically have a three-year duration and we have experienced a renewal rate of 98%, and our transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations provides visibility into contracted revenue that will be recognized in future periods. We maintain non-cancellable purchase commitments of $1.6 billion and operating lease obligations of $937 million to support our business operations, we invest in capital and other resources to expand our data centers and enable our workforce and we acquire technology and businesses to supplement our portfolio, and we may repurchase shares of common stock to return value to stockholders and manage dilution—all of which reflect strategic resource allocation and operational continuity measures designed to preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions.

The company’s management discussion describes a multifaceted approach to maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions through continuous refinement of its safety and service programs, deploying additional locomotives and personnel, and leveraging proprietary software and data analytics to anticipate and mitigate risks.  Historical injury data were analyzed to isolate critical operating rules and inform a refreshed safety culture with enhanced training and proactive intervention by the operating practices command center, including simulations of in-train forces and installation of additional hot wheel bearing detectors to prevent derailments.  Network fluidity and operational flexibility were improved by aggressively hiring and backfilling attrition among train, engine, and yard employees, deploying resources to alleviate weather-related service disruptions, and monitoring key operating metrics such as freight car velocity, terminal dwell time, and car trip plan compliance to assess and reconfigure operational trajectories in response to evolving conditions.  Risk assessment strategies and hazard identification processes have been embedded in a comprehensive safety management approach that combines technology, employee engagement, targeted capital investments, and first responder training to maintain continuity of operations.  The company’s capital plan and liquidity management reflect a systemic perspective on resilience, with analyses of a broad range of economic scenarios to ensure sufficient borrowing capacity and diversified financing sources, capital expenditures to harden infrastructure, replace aging assets, and modernize the locomotive fleet, and climate scenario analyses to understand and prepare for environmental perturbations.  Sensitivity analyses of interest rate and tax rate fluctuations further illustrate efforts to assess vulnerabilities and preserve organizational strength, while community-focused risk mitigation programs—such as crossing safety education and collaboration with law enforcement and industry partners—underscore a dynamic capability to absorb strain and preserve or improve performance despite adverse internal or external variations.

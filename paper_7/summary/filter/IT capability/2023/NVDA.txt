NVIDIA has increased its supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors, and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements while building finished products and maintaining inventory in advance of anticipated demand to absorb supply chain strain and preserve operational continuity despite shortening lead times and heightened execution risk. Product transitions—often involving simultaneous shipments of new and prior architectures—require extensive qualification processes, channel inventory adjustments, and support for multiple architecture generations, demanding operational flexibility to mitigate volatility in revenue, manage complexity, and avoid quality or production delays. The company continuously monitors geopolitical developments, including evolving U.S. export licensing requirements for high-performance integrated circuits and the conflict in and around Israel, and has adapted by expanding its data center product portfolio to include non-restricted alternatives, commencing shipments of such alternatives in small volumes, enhancing supply chain resiliency and redundancy, and providing financial and logistical support to impacted employees to maintain workforce health and continuity. Macroeconomic factors such as inflation, increased interest rates, capital market volatility, and global supply chain constraints have prompted ongoing management of product availability, vendor relationships, and manufacturing costs, while liquidity and capital resources—including cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and external financing access—are continuously evaluated to ensure sufficient funding for operating requirements, future supply obligations, planned capital investments, debt repayments, and share repurchases. Critical accounting estimates in inventories, revenue recognition, and income taxes involve significant judgments to address uncertainties and maintain financial stability, reflecting the company’s capacity to absorb disturbances, reconfigure resource commitments, and maintain performance under challenging internal and external conditions.

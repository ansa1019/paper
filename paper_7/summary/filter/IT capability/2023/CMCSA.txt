Management’s discussion and analysis describes a comprehensive reconfiguration of our segment operating results presentation to enhance transparency and situational awareness of our operations and evolving business environment, and emphasizes that our consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with this analysis to fully understand our performance under varying conditions. We continue to allocate significant resources toward scalable network infrastructure, line extensions and wireless gateway deployments to support higher-speed broadband offerings, expand our footprint of homes and businesses passed and preserve service continuity, while strategically managing overall operating costs. The analysis acknowledges the pressures of an increasingly competitive environment, shifting video consumption patterns, low household move levels, global economic conditions and consumer sentiment on customer relationships and revenue streams, and sets forth adaptive response strategies designed to grow broadband, wireless and international connectivity revenues even as video and wireline voice services face declines. Capital expenditures are expected to remain focused on connectivity-related capacity enhancements and in-park investments—such as the development of Epic Universe—to bolster guest attendance and spending, illustrating forward-looking resource reconfiguration. We maintain substantial liquidity and financial flexibility through operating cash flows, cash and investments, a commercial paper program and a revolving credit facility with $11.0 billion of available capacity, while adhering to leverage covenants, thereby demonstrating preparedness for internal or external variations. Our financing activities include optional debt repayments, the issuance of fixed-rate senior notes (including green bonds to fund eligible projects), conditional proceeds from a spectrum license sale agreement, and share repurchase and dividend policies that offset dilution and support shareholder returns, all aimed at preserving capital structure stability and risk mitigation. The critical accounting estimates section highlights our systematic impairment testing of goodwill, cable franchise rights and capitalized film and television content via discounted-cash-flow models that incorporate market participant assumptions and discount rates, reflecting disciplined asset valuation and risk assessment processes. Finally, our use of non-GAAP metrics, such as adjusted EBITDA and constant-currency measures, serves as organizational intelligence tools to isolate operational performance from noncash charges, foreign exchange fluctuations and capital structure effects, thus enabling robust monitoring and maintenance of performance under both nominal and challenging conditions.

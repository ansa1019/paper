In 2023, Bristol Myers Squibb pursued a series of strategic initiatives—expanding its CAR-T manufacturing network through FDA approval of its Devens facility, acquiring Mirati and entering definitive agreements to acquire Karuna and RayzeBio, and forming a collaboration with SystImmune—to reconfigure resources, diversify its pipeline and absorb external shocks such as generic erosion and evolving pricing regulations, thereby preserving operational continuity and maintaining performance under pressure. The company’s focus on combining the scale and capabilities of a large pharmaceutical organization with the speed, agility and innovation of a biotech enabled rapid adaptation of its R&D and commercial portfolios, including expanding from six toward a potential twelve first-in-class assets, advancing over 25 indication expansions and sustaining R&D productivity by targeting ten IND submissions per year and compressing median approval timelines. Simultaneously, disciplined business development, proactive liquidity management—including a new $10 billion bridge loan facility, robust credit facilities and contingency commercial paper capacity—and prudent capital allocation to manufacturing, research platforms and share repurchases supported financial flexibility, risk mitigation and the maintenance of investment-grade credit ratings. An evolving operating model that emphasizes streamlined marketing, selling and administrative expenses, rigorous governance and transparent accounting policies, together with environmental, social and governance commitments, underpins the firm’s ability to foresee, confront and benefit from sudden disruptive change, ensuring the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions and the preservation of system integrity and sustained firm performance.

Revenues were negatively impacted by weakness in the macroeconomic environment and customers drawing down on elevated inventory levels, and management expects continued inventory drawdowns and weaker consumer demand to introduce uncertainties in estimating future customer demand that may increase excess or obsolete inventory or reserve charges and negatively impact results of operations and cash flows. In response to these external pressures, the company recorded $712 million in restructuring and restructuring-related charges in fiscal 2023, substantially all of which related to severance costs, and has initiated certain restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 to enable investments in key growth and diversification opportunities. The decrease in gross margin percentage in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to increased product costs and lower revenues, and management expects continued product cost increases from key semiconductor wafer suppliers. The company believes it is important to remain a leader in 5G technology development, standardization, intellectual property creation and licensing, and a leading developer and supplier of 5G integrated circuit products to sustain and grow its business long term, reflecting a system perspective and future orientation. The company continues to devote resources to working with and educating participants in the wireless industry and governments regarding the benefits of its licensing programs and extensive technology investments in promoting a highly competitive and innovative wireless industry, recognizing potential challenges from dissatisfied companies and regulatory scrutiny. Management’s principal sources of liquidity are existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations and cash provided by debt programs, including $8.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $11.3 billion of combined cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at September 24, 2023, and an unsecured commercial paper program and revolving credit facility, which it believes will satisfy working and other capital requirements for at least the next 12 months based on current business plans. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the company issued $1.9 billion of unsecured fixed-rate notes, used to repay maturing notes and for general corporate purposes; at September 24, 2023, the company had $15.9 billion of principal fixed-rate notes outstanding with maturities through 2053. The company expects to issue new debt in the future depending on factors such as debt maturities, acquisitions and strategic investments, favorable interest rates and changes in corporate income tax law. At September 24, 2023, purchase obligations totaled $12.2 billion, of which $6.8 billion is expected to be paid within 12 months, and operating lease obligations totaled $872 million, with $116 million expected within 12 months. Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion in fiscal 2023, reduced in response to macroeconomic weakness, and the company accrued $385 million of severance costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, substantially all expected to be paid in the first half of fiscal 2024. The company expects to continue making strategic investments and acquisitions, which could vary significantly, and notes that geopolitical conflicts, trade relations, regulatory investigations and litigation may significantly disrupt its business, presenting risks that could have a material adverse effect on business continuity, financial condition and cash flows. Management employs critical accounting estimates, including monitoring investments for impairment based on investee forecasts and industry performance, revenue recognition based on licensees’ preliminary royalty estimates, inventory valuation at the lower of cost or net realizable value considering customer demand and market conditions, impairment assessments of goodwill, other indefinite-lived and long-lived assets, evaluations of legal and regulatory contingencies when losses are probable and reasonably estimable, and significant judgments in determining the provision for income taxes, all of which support the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity.

Mastercard’s disclosures describe a technology‐enabled, multi‐rail global payments network whose interdependent capabilities—including authorization, clearing and settlement functions as well as batch and real‐time automated clearing house transactions—are designed to absorb strain, maintain integrity and support business continuity under varying internal and external pressures; the company employs a multi-layered risk‐mitigation framework to protect its ecosystem, invests in resilient infrastructure such as open banking solutions and digital identity capabilities to strengthen service innovation and system resilience, and uses a franchise model that balances value and risk across stakeholders to enable interoperability and operational flexibility. The firm relies on robust liquidity sources—$9.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments, an $8 billion committed revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program—to fund operations, settlement guarantees and contingencies, ensuring positive adjustment to settlement failures or market disruptions. Mastercard actively manages foreign currency volatility through derivative hedges, maintains sufficient cash flows from operations ($12.0 billion generated in 2023), completes targeted debt issuances and share repurchases to preserve financial resilience, and applies non-GAAP measures and key performance drivers—gross dollar volume, cross-border volume, switched transactions and network assessments—to monitor trends, inform strategic resource allocation and sustain performance under pressure. Its accounting policies for rebates and incentives, loss contingencies for litigation provisions and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets further reflect a systematic, forward-looking approach to preserving organizational health, mitigating risk and preserving or improving functioning in the face of legal, regulatory or economic disturbances.

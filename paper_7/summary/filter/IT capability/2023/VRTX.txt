The company describes its ongoing monitoring and evaluation of discovery, research, clinical and nonclinical studies “with the objective of balancing risk and potential,” enabling “rapid changes in focus and priorities as new information becomes available,” and invests in a diversified pipeline “utilizing a range of modalities” to maintain adaptability in the face of evolving scientific, regulatory and competitive pressures. It “relies on a global network of third parties and our internal capabilities to manufacture and distribute our products,” builds and maintains supply chain and quality assurance resources, and “adapts our supply chain for existing products to include additional formulations or to increase scale of production … as needed,” thereby ensuring stability and continuity under internal and external variations. The firm “dedicates substantial management and other resources to obtain and maintain appropriate levels of reimbursement” from government and commercial payors, while acknowledging that “reimbursement … cannot be assured and may take significant periods of time,” and it prepares contingency plans for changes in law or payor policies. Through strategic acquisitions, collaborations and licensing arrangements—including joint development and cost-sharing agreements with CRISPR, Moderna and Entrada—the company secures external knowledge, shares development and commercialization risks, and aligns resource allocation to respond effectively to disruptions. It maintains robust liquidity by relying on existing cash, marketable securities and cash flows from product sales, supplementing these with an undrawn revolving credit facility, and forecasting future capital requirements for research and development, manufacturing, tax and royalty obligations. The organization’s ability to “balance the risks inherent in product development,” rapidly reconfigure priorities, leverage inter-organizational collaboration, and sustain operations under evolving environmental, regulatory and financial conditions exemplifies its capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity.

Over the period from 2020 through 2023, Abbott mobilized cross-functional teams and reconfigured its operations to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by developing and launching multiple diagnostic tests under emergency use authorizations and CE marks, absorbing volatile demand that ranged from 17.8 percent of total sales in 2021 to 1.6 percent in 2023 and shifting toward routine diagnostic and cardiovascular procedure volume recoveries despite intermittent lockdowns and staffing challenges. Abbott managed supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures on services, raw materials and transportation without material shortages by diversifying sourcing, increasing production at alternate facilities, prioritizing critical product lines, implementing price adjustments and gross margin improvement initiatives. During the voluntary infant formula recall, the company halted production at its Sturgis facility, entered into a consent decree with the FDA to restore operations, and reconstituted its manufacturing network by importing product, converting liquid lines, and ramping up output in Ohio, Arizona and overseas plants, thus enabling it to recover market-leading share by year-end 2023. To sustain financial resilience, Abbott maintained an investment-grade credit rating, replaced a five-year credit agreement in January 2024, repurchased shares under ongoing authorizations, declared consistently higher dividends, and deployed cash flows to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions of Bigfoot Biomedical and Cardiovascular Systems, ongoing research and development, and defined benefit plan contributions. The company routinely monitors and accrues for rebates, tax contingencies, litigation exposure and intangible asset valuations, conducts quantitative impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, evaluates emerging accounting standards and geopolitical risks such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and restructures operations in medical devices, diagnostics and pharmaceuticals—recording severance, fixed-asset and inventory charges—to preserve integrity and maintain performance under evolving internal and external pressures.

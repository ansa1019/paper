In fiscal 2023, we took multiple actions to mitigate component shortages and address significant supply constraints industry-wide, including partnering with key suppliers, utilizing volume purchasing, extending supply coverage, committing to higher costs for certain components, modifying product designs to leverage alternate suppliers and continually optimizing inventory build and customer delivery plans, thereby demonstrating the ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning in adverse conditions. We regularly evaluate our exposure to excess and obsolete inventories, record provisions for inventory write-downs and liability for purchase commitments, assess loss contingencies, goodwill and intangible asset impairment indicators, and adjust tax reserves as facts and circumstances change, evidencing systemic risk assessment, resource reconfiguration and organizational flexibility. In the second quarter, we announced a restructuring plan impacting approximately 5% of the global workforce to rebalance the organization and reinvest cost savings in key priority areas, with the plan to be substantially completed by the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and anticipated to reinforce long-term strategic agility. Our strong cash and cash equivalents position, diverse high-quality investment portfolio and free cash flow generation provide financial resources for strategic investments in research and development, acquisitions, customer financing, working capital needs, share repurchases and dividends, supporting operational continuity and future orientation amid a challenging macroeconomic and competitive landscape. Managementâ€™s use of forward-looking statements, dynamic forecasts, capital allocation strategy targeting the return of at least 50% of free cash flow to stockholders, and ongoing assessments of contractual performance obligations and deferred revenue illustrate proactive measures to maintain integrity and performance under variability and transform the organization to emerge stronger from disruptive events.

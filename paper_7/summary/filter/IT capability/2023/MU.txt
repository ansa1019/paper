During the period of sharply deteriorated industry conditions and weak demand, we absorbed significant strain by recognizing $1.83 billion of inventory write-downs to net realizable value, reducing wafer starts and capital expenditures to manage supply-demand mismatches, and instituting industry-wide supply discipline, productivity programs, suspension of the 2023 bonus, reductions in discretionary spending, and cuts to executive salaries. In response to external pressures such as the China CAC cybersecurity decision restricting sales to critical infrastructure operators, we continue to work to mitigate headwinds, expect quarter-to-quarter revenue variability, and maintain our long-term goal of retaining worldwide DRAM and NAND market share. Under our 2023 restructure plan, we reduced headcount by approximately 15 percent through voluntary attrition and personnel reductions, incurring $171 million of charges and targeting approximately $130 million of quarterly cost savings across cost of goods sold, R&D, and SG&A. To strengthen our competitive position and allocate resources efficiently, we updated our portfolio strategy by ceasing development of 3D XPoint, classifying related assets as held for sale, and recording associated impairment charges. We maintain operational flexibility and system resilience by analyzing inventories on a FIFO basis at the lower of cost or net realizable value, projecting future average selling prices, volumes, and cost per part, and recording underutilization costs of $382 million in 2023. Our liquidity and capital resource management combines cash from operations, diversified, high-credit-quality investments, $2.5 billion available under a revolving credit facility, and financing transactions, including CHIPS Act-contingent investments in two leading-edge DRAM fabs in Boise and Clay, New York, and back-end assembly and test facilities in Xiâ€™an, China and Gujarat, India. Our critical accounting estimates for contingencies, goodwill, deferred taxes, property, plant and equipment, and revenue recognition are based on ongoing assessments of future cash flows, impairment indicators, tax jurisdictions, and variable consideration, supporting our ability to absorb disruptions, maintain integrity and performance under adversity, and emerge stronger from challenging situations.

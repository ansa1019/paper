Management describes the organization of its diverse operating businesses as unusually decentralized, with few centralized functions and senior management ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation, investment activities and the appointment of operating-unit CEOs. To varying degrees, these operating units have absorbed strain from government and private sector actions taken to mitigate the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 virus and its variants, global geopolitical conflicts, supply-chain disruptions and inflation-slowing policies, and management acknowledges it cannot reliably predict the future economic effects of such events. Insurance underwriting operations monitor the timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses—treating pre-tax incurred losses exceeding $150 million as significant—and adjust estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses through case development analyses and retroactive reinsurance evaluations to preserve underwriting performance under extreme conditions. The investment strategy emphasizes maintaining ample liquidity in short-term instruments, insisting on safety over yield. Utilities and energy businesses have recognized increased loss accruals for wildfires, navigated regulatory rate cases, weather variability and interest-rate changes to sustain electric margins despite lower volumes and higher operating costs, while pipeline, renewable energy and exploration segments reconfigured asset portfolios and capital expenditures in response to rate decisions, commodity price volatility and new tax-law provisions. Manufacturing and service segments have confronted supply constraints, unplanned maintenance, raw-material and freight cost inflation and geopolitical disruptions by enhancing manufacturing efficiencies, right-sizing inventories, executing strategic acquisitions and adjusting workforce and expense structures to maintain stability amid volume declines. Retailing businesses have managed low inventory levels, rising interest rates and shifting consumer demand by adjusting pricing, margins, customer service operations and floor-plan financing, while distribution arms have confronted labor and driver shortages, high fuel costs and elevated customer inventory positions. Throughout, the company’s emphasis on decentralized decision-making, rigorous internal control over financial reporting, regular liability reassessments, targeted capital spending, robust cash-flow generation and a strong capital base underpins its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite ongoing environmental perturbations, regulatory pressures and market uncertainties.

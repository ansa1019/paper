We continue to invest in a new enterprise resource planning platform, data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering and other areas to create an end-to-end technology foundation, which we believe will further accelerate our digital transformation and drive speed and responsiveness as we serve consumers globally. Through the consumer direct acceleration strategy, we are focused on creating the marketplace of the future with more premium, consistent and seamless consumer experiences, leading with digital and our owned stores, as well as select wholesale partners, and our product creation and marketing organizations are aligned to a consumer construct focused on sports dimensions through men’s, women’s and kids’, which allows us to better serve consumer needs. We will continue to closely monitor macroeconomic conditions, including potential impacts of inflation and rising interest rates on consumer behavior, as the operating environment could remain volatile in fiscal 2024 and worsening macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse impact on our future revenue growth and overall profitability. Supply chain challenges, macroeconomic conditions and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the manufacturing of our product disrupted the flow of seasonal product in fiscal 2022 and the first quarter of fiscal 2023, resulting in elevated inventory levels; throughout fiscal 2023, we took action to reduce excess inventory by decreasing future inventory purchases and increasing promotional activity, and these actions, along with the stabilization of inventory transit times in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2023, resulted in the normalization of the seasonal flow of product in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. During the first and second quarters of fiscal 2023, we managed through continued temporary store closures and reduced retail traffic in Greater China due to COVID-19 related local government restrictions, and at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the government-mandated restrictions were lifted and we experienced improvement in physical retail traffic. As a global company with significant operations outside the United States, we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates, and our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows; we manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using forward and option contracts, with a hedging policy designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting; to minimize this translational volatility, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. dollar-denominated available-for-sale investments, and we utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these investments. We believe that existing cash and equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future, and we continue to invest in our infrastructure to support future growth, specifically focused around digital capabilities, our end-to-end technology foundation, our corporate facilities and improvements across our supply chain.

The company discloses a range of operational and strategic measures that collectively underpin its capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under adversity. It acknowledges macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties—ranging from supply-chain disruptions, elevated component costs, inflationary pressures, higher interest rates and potential supplier insolvencies to labor shortages, hospital staffing constraints and volatile credit access—and reports being “actively engaged in activities to seek to mitigate the impact of any supply chain disruptions on our operations.” It has diversified its financing structures by offering fixed-payment and usage-based operating leases, expanding “alternative financing structures” to provide customers with flexibility and to smooth capital investment cycles under budgetary constraints. The company monitors and adapts to external regulatory and policy shifts—such as elongated product-approval timelines, China’s medical-device quotas and anti-corruption campaign, provincial limits on procedure fees, and Japan’s biennial reimbursement process—through measured rollout strategies, additional clinical and economic data collection, and incremental market authorizations. The firm has demonstrated operational flexibility and continuity in its response to COVID-19 resurgences, noting that “after each resurgence … we saw procedure volumes recover,” while also recognizing that backlogs, deferred diagnoses, and hospital resource challenges may produce both adverse and subsequent positive volume effects. Internally, management relies on key metrics—installed base, placements, utilization and procedure volumes—as leading indicators for financial and operational decision-making, forecasting, resource allocation and performance assessment, while acknowledging the susceptibility of these estimates to connectivity, reporting behavior and technical errors. The company also highlights its dependency on critical personnel, the potential credit risks in its leasing portfolios, and competitive and customer-driven pressures, and it anticipates that future system placements and revenue will be influenced by a complex interplay of supply-chain risks, evolving utilization patterns, capital replacement trends, regulatory clearances, hospital responses, pandemic-related dynamics and competitive entrants in the robotic-assisted surgery space.

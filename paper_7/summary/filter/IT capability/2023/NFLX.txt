In response to evolving market conditions and external pressures, management discontinued its DVD-by-mail service in September 2023—an action that had an immaterial impact on operations—while delivering a 23 percent increase in operating income and a three-point improvement in operating margin by growing revenues faster than costs and reallocating spending across technology, development, marketing and general and administrative functions. Streaming revenues rose 7 percent in 2023, driven by an 8 percent increase in average paying memberships and adaptive plan pricing and mix, despite a 1 percent decline in average monthly revenue per membership and unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations. The company has built its own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) to ensure efficient high-volume streaming and maintain system integrity, and it continues to invest strategically in content acquisition, licensing and original production in order to sustain growth and preserve liquidity. Management anticipates that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to its $1 billion revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet cash needs over the next twelve months and beyond, although additional financing remains subject to capital markets conditions and could affect shareholder dilution. Primary uses of cash include content-related payments—which decreased by $3.5 billion in 2023—marketing, streaming delivery, personnel costs and targeted strategic acquisitions and share repurchases under board authorization. The company closely monitors contractual obligations for content commitments, debt and operating leases, employs non-GAAP measures such as constant currency revenue to assess performance under volatility, and applies critical accounting judgments to content amortization, tax incentives and liability measurements to preserve financial stability and organizational adaptability under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

The discussion describes a range of practices and resources that support the company’s ability to maintain performance under challenging conditions, including perpetual productivity improvement initiatives that provide the flexibility to control costs and respond to changes in demand, omnichannel investments that enhance technology capabilities and improve the customer experience, and a disciplined inventory management process that aligns replenishment with sales trends and adjusts reserves for obsolescence and shrinkage based on historical experience. It also highlights the company’s rigorous long-lived asset impairment review, which identifies triggering events such as sustained negative cash flow or anticipated early dispositions and uses income- or market-based approaches incorporating projected cash flows and discount rates to assess recoverability and preserve asset integrity, as well as a self-insurance framework that accrues reserves for workers’ compensation, liability and medical claims using actuarial methods and excess coverage to limit exposure. Liquidity management is underscored by $8.1 billion of operating cash flows, $4 billion of undrawn credit facilities, and access to commercial paper and long-term debt markets to fund operations, strategic investments, share repurchases and debt maturities, with capital expenditure plans that can be adjusted in response to economic conditions. These integrated strategies and capabilities collectively demonstrate the company’s capacity to absorb strain, adapt to external pressures, and sustain or improve functioning despite adversity.

PepsiCo discloses that, as a global company with deep local ties, it “faced many of the same challenges in 2023 as our consumers, customers, and competitors across the world, including supply chain disruptions; inflationary pressures; shifting consumer preferences and behaviors; ongoing climate issues; a highly competitive operating environment; a rapidly changing retail landscape, including growth in e-commerce; continued macroeconomic and political volatility, including the deadly conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East; and an evolving regulatory landscape,” and in response has adopted Pep+ (PepsiCo Positive), “a strategic end-to-end transformation of our business, with sustainability at the center of how the company will strive to create growth and value, while inspiring positive change for the planet and people,” so as to enhance operational flexibility, resource deployment and positive adjustment under challenging conditions.  The company further describes an enterprise-wide, integrated risk management framework designed to “identify, assess, prioritize, address, manage, monitor and communicate these risks across the company’s operations and foster a corporate culture of integrity and risk awareness,” with oversight by the Board and its committees and execution by cross-functional senior management risk committees, a central risk management office, internal audit, compliance and disclosure functions, all of which continually monitor internal and external environments, disruptive events such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and commodity inflation, macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, and emerging risks—such as taxes, regulations, cyber threats, climate change requirements, labor and supply chain shortages—and seek actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on the company’s future results, thereby preserving system integrity and maintaining performance under pressure.

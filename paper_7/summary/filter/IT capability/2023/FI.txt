The Company is effecting changes in its business designed to further enhance operational performance in the delivery of its integrated portfolio of products and solutions, including a realignment of its reportable segments and a continued disciplined allocation of resources and performance assessment under the current segment structure. Management frequently reviews its businesses to ensure the necessary assets are in place to execute strategic priorities, acquiring assets when they meet compelling needs—such as technology or scale to drive competition and operational efficiency—and divesting those no longer aligned with market, product or financial strategies, thereby reconfiguring resources to preserve or improve functioning under changing conditions. The Company actively monitors and manages its operations in response to unpredictable geopolitical and market pressures—including global macroeconomic uncertainty, rising interest rates, inflation, bank failures, supply chain disruptions, currency volatility and regulatory shifts—to mitigate risks and maintain liquidity, leveraging $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, commercial paper programs and a $6 billion revolving credit facility. It uses operating cash flow primarily to fund capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayments, demonstrating adaptability and financial resilience. The Company also reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential recoverability issues, using discounted cash flow and market approaches with judgmental estimates to absorb uncertainty and maintain system integrity. Through operating leverage, expense management initiatives and strategic gains from the sale of businesses, the Company has strengthened its margins and preserved performance under pressure, positioning itself to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and reemerge stronger from challenging situations.

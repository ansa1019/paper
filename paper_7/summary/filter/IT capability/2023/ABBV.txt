AbbVie is described as a “global, diversified research-based biopharmaceutical company positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio” that “uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation” to develop and market advanced therapies and operates as a single global business segment. In 2024 the company’s strategic objectives include “maximizing the benefits of a diversified revenue base with multiple long-term growth drivers,” “leveraging AbbVie’s commercial strength and international infrastructure,” “continuing to invest in and expand its pipeline,” “generating substantial operating cash flows to support investment in innovative research and development, and return cash to shareholders via a strong and growing dividend while also continuing to repay debt,” and achieving these objectives through “successful integration of the ImmunoGen, Inc. and proposed Cerevel Therapeutics acquisitions.” AbbVie’s 2023 financial results “reflected continued funding to support all stages of AbbVie’s pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVie’s on-market brands,” demonstrating resource allocation under competitive and regulatory pressures. The company “continues to pursue strategies to maintain broad formulary access of Humira and manage the impact of biosimilar erosion” and is “effectively managing regulatory, market and competitive challenges impacting Imbruvica,” illustrating risk mitigation and adaptation to disruptive events. To maintain liquidity and operational continuity, AbbVie “entered into an amended and restated five-year revolving credit facility” increasing commitments to $5.0 billion and extending maturity to March 2028, holds undrawn acquisition bridge and term loan facilities, and “may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed.” AbbVie “monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding,” “establishes an allowance for credit losses,” and “utilize[s] factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk,” reflecting structured risk assessment and mitigation. The company’s balance-sheet management further includes share repurchases of 10 million shares for $1.6 billion in 2023 with $4.8 billion remaining authorization and a quarterly dividend increase to $1.55 per share, evidencing disciplined resource reconfiguration. AbbVie measures and revalues contingent consideration liabilities at fair value each reporting date, tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events occur, and adjusts amortization and allowances to reflect changes in product mix and performance, underscoring its capacity to absorb strain, preserve performance and adapt organizational practices under evolving internal and external disturbances.

Since 2008, we have invested $12.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, building “world-class scientific assessment capabilities,” notably in pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies; in November 2022, we acquired Swedish Match AB, a leader in oral nicotine delivery, creating a global smoke-free combination led by the companies’ IQOS and ZYN brands, and in January 2023 reorganized our business into four geographical segments (down from six) to reflect progress toward integrating the Swedish Match business and to enhance operational flexibility and resource deployment; on February 1, 2024, we entered into a global settlement with British American Tobacco P.L.C. that resolves all ongoing patent infringement litigation related to heated tobacco and vapor products through non-monetary provisions and enables each party to innovate and introduce product iterations; in Ukraine, our main priority remains the safety and security of our employees and their families, and we continue commercial activities in select locations where safety allows by supplying the market from production centers outside Ukraine and through a contract manufacturing arrangement while production at our factory in Kharkiv remains suspended, and on June 20, 2023, we announced the investment of $30 million in a new production facility in the Lviv region—preparatory work began in July 2023 and production is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2024; in Russia, we are continuously assessing the evolving situation, including regulatory constraints and restrictions from international regulations, acknowledging that any divestment could be subject to material impairment; these developments have and will continue to have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position and may result in impairment charges.

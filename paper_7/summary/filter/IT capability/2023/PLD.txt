In 2023, despite uncertainties in the economic and geopolitical environment, Prologis maintained positive operational momentum, achieving strong rental rate growth, high portfolio occupancy, and generating net cash from operations of $5.4 billion, supported by $6.0 billion of available liquidity and diversified financing arrangements that include natural currency hedges and interest rate derivatives. The company’s strategic amendments to its global and regional credit facilities, issuance of $5.4 billion of senior notes with staggered maturities, and proactive management of its debt portfolio—comprising a weighted average nine-year maturity and 3.0 percent effective interest rate—evidence deliberate resource deployment and risk mitigation designed to preserve financial flexibility under external pressures. Capital allocation to development projects, sustainable building enhancements, and co-investment ventures, combined with dispositions that generated $2.1 billion in net proceeds, reflect a systemic approach to reconfiguring assets and reallocating capital to growth opportunities. Prologis’s robust same-store NOI growth, disciplined acquisition and disposition activities, and structured equity commitments across multiple logistics funds and ventures further underscore its capacity to absorb financial strain, sustain performance during market perturbations, and adapt operating parameters to evolving demand, thereby supporting the maintenance of organizational performance, continuity and resilience as defined by Vogus & Sutcliffe (2007) as the “maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.”

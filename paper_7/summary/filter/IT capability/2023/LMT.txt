Lockheed Martin describes operating in a complex and evolving global security environment and has structured its strategy to accelerate the adoption of advanced networking and leading-edge technologies into the national defense enterprise, enhancing agility, adaptability and unpredictability of defense forces. Key to executing this strategy is a multi-year business transformation initiative to enhance digital infrastructure, increase efficiencies and collaboration, and develop differentiating technologies through independent research and development, strategic acquisitions, divestitures and internal realignment activities. The company continuously monitors and mitigates risks arising from U.S. government budget uncertainties, funding delays under continuing resolutions, potential government shutdowns, inflationary pressures and persistent supply chain disruptions—including supplier shortages, performance issues and delayed customer deliveries—by leveraging diversified liquidity sources such as operating cash flows, a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility, commercial paper programs and strategic credit market access. To anticipate and respond to shifting demand driven by geopolitical tensions and foreign military sales, Lockheed Martin works with its supply chain to evaluate capacity increases, invests substantially in workforce talent and technical skills, and manages long-term contracts using percentage-of-completion accounting with regular revisions to technical, schedule and cost estimates and profit booking rates as risks are retired or emerge. Its portfolio-shaping approach, involving selective pursuit of acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and equity investments alongside strategic partnerships with commercial and international entities, supports resource allocation aligned with customer needs and future growth objectives. The company manages contractual commitments, including offset agreements requiring local investment obligations, and maintains financial flexibility through disciplined capital deployment—prioritizing capital expenditures, generating free cash flow, increasing dividends and authorizing share repurchases—while actively managing debt maturities, interest rate exposure and pension obligations via liability transfers to insurance companies. Its MD&A further details risk management practices in environmental remediation, postretirement benefit plan funding and actuarial assumptions, goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing, and contract accounting provisions for potential reach-forward losses, all of which underpin the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions.

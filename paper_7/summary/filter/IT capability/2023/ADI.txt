In fiscal 2023, we recorded $160.7 million of charges primarily related to our Q4 2023 plan to reorganize our business, consisting of voluntary and involuntary reductions-in-force and other cost-savings initiatives, which was commenced to adjust our cost structure and business activities to better align with weaker market demand and continued economic uncertainty in our end markets, as well as make strategic shifts in our workforce necessary to achieve our long-term vision. We believe that a continued commitment to research and development is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings, and we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds held by our foreign subsidiaries and the cost-effectiveness by which those funds can be accessed in the United States, and we maintain our cash and cash equivalents with highly liquid investments, monitoring credit exposure and diversifying our investments in order to minimize credit risk. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available short- and long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and dividend payments in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months. Capital expenditures were $1.3 billion in fiscal 2023 as we invested to enhance our global resiliency, and we expect capital expenditures of between approximately $600 million and $800 million in fiscal 2024, which we plan to fund with cash on hand and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available financing. We have established a commercial paper program under which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes and we remain compliant with our revolving credit facility covenants, including a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated EBITDA of not greater than 3.5 to 1.0. Inventory increased in fiscal 2023 primarily as a result of our efforts to balance manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels to support forecasted sales demand and accommodate variations between forecasts and actual demand. We regularly hedge our non-U.S. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts with major counterparties, matching the duration of the underlying exposures, in order to mitigate foreign currency market risk.

The Company highlights its reliance on expanded e-commerce operations and online offerings to bolster comparable sales growth domestically and internationally, reflecting the evolution of its IT capability to support business strategies and processes. It identifies information systems as a primary capital requirement alongside land, buildings and equipment, investing $2.998 billion in fiscal 2019 with plans for $3.0–$3.2 billion in fiscal 2020 funded by operating cash flows and existing liquidity, underscoring the mobilization of IT resources to coordinate new and remodeled warehouse rollouts, manufacturing and distribution facilities, and working capital needs. A uniform operating model across U.S., Canadian and other international segments implies standardized architecture for financial reporting, foreign-exchange conversions and the settlement of credit and debit card receivables within four days, while preopening expenses for new warehouses and facility expansions inherently encompass systems infrastructure for operational startup, membership acquisition and deferred revenue recognition over one-year membership periods. The maintenance of bank credit and commercial and standby letter of credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes further presumes IT-enabled transaction processing, monitoring and governance capabilities, and the systematic tracking of key metrics—including membership growth, renewal rates, average ticket, inventory investments and gross margin performance—underscores the information management capability delivered with appropriate accuracy, timeliness and reliability to support managerial decision-making and adapt pricing and merchandising strategies amid evolving economic, competitive and regulatory conditions.

We sell our products globally through a direct sales force, third-party distributors, independent sales representatives and via our website, determining revenue by end market using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the “sold-to” and “ship-to” customer information and the end customer application, and as data systems for capturing and tracking this data and our methodology evolve and improve, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. We maintain cash and cash equivalents with high credit-quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments to minimize credit risk. We have hundreds of R&D projects underway and expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products, viewing a continued commitment to R&D as essential to maintain product leadership with our existing offerings and to provide innovative new products. In fiscal 2019, we recorded special charges of $88.1 million as a result of organizational initiatives to reposition our global workforce skill set to align with our long-term strategic plan—approximately $73.9 million related to severance and fringe benefits and $14.2 million related to the write-off of acquired intellectual property upon discontinuation of certain product development strategies—which once fully implemented are expected to result in net annualized cash savings of approximately $48.0 million. As part of our effort to improve operational effectiveness and efficiency, we consolidated certain wafer fabrication and test facility operations acquired in a prior period, recorded special charges of $7.6 million to date and plan over the next one to three years to close our Hillview wafer fabrication facility and our Singapore test facility, transferring production to internal sites, external foundries and outsourced partners. Under ASU 2014-09, we recognize revenue upon transfer of control only after we have entered into a binding agreement, identified the performance obligations, determined and allocated the transaction price and satisfied those obligations, generally at shipment or delivery, and for contracts with the U.S. government and certain commercial customers over time using units delivered or costs incurred, supported by contract accounting processes requiring judgment in estimating costs, technical issues and delivery schedules. We value inventories at the lower of cost (FIFO) or market and employ a variety of methodologies—subject to significant judgment about future demand—to write down slow-moving or obsolete inventory to net realizable value. We review property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable and perform annual qualitative and quantitative assessments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets using discounted cash flow and market approaches to ensure fair values exceed carrying amounts. We utilize derivative instruments to hedge non-U.S. dollar exposures with forward foreign currency exchange contracts matched to our exposures, and we refinanced prior term loans into a $1.25 billion unsecured term loan due March 2022 and maintain a $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility due June 2024, believing these sources together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, R&D efforts and dividends for at least the next twelve months. Collectively, these actions reflect our evolving information management capabilities, the deployment and reconfiguration of technology and human resources and the transformation of internal processes and interfirm relationships in support of our strategic objectives.

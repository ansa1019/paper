During 2019 and 2018, the company significantly expanded its technology infrastructure and capabilities through increased spending on technology projects and process automation, including investments in additional software licenses and capitalized internal-use software costs totaling $165 million, ongoing amortization of internally developed software, and enhancement of campus facilities to support scalable operations. Management’s forward-looking statements underscore the firm’s intent and risk related to its ability to develop and launch new and enhanced products, services, and infrastructure, including the timing of campus expansion work and technology initiatives, in a timely and successful manner. The risk management disclosures describe a comprehensive information security program that integrates tools, controls and technologies to safeguard systems and data, enforces internal authentication measures, limits employee access to sensitive information, provides regular privacy and security training, and employs advanced monitoring systems to detect and deter unauthorized access. Business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities are maintained through a backup and recovery infrastructure, a geographically dispersed workforce and routine testing of incident management plans. Oversight of third-party service providers for technology, processing and support functions, as well as model governance policies for development and use of analytical tools, further reflect the firm’s mobilization and deployment of IT resources in support of operational efficiency, process control, risk monitoring and strategic alignment with business objectives.

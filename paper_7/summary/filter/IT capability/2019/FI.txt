We operate as a leading global provider of financial services technology, offering account processing systems; electronic payments processing products and services; internet and mobile banking systems; merchant transaction processing and acquiring platforms; and check verification solutions. Our payments segment delivers electronic bill payment and presentment services, internet and mobile banking software and services, account-to-account transfers, person-to-person payment services, payments infrastructure services and other electronic payments software and services, including fraud and risk management products and services, while our financial segment provides account processing, item processing and source capture services, loan origination and servicing products, cash management and consulting services. The global payments landscape continues to evolve, with rapidly advancing technologies and a steady expansion of digital payments, e-commerce and innovation in real-time payments infrastructure, driving payments companies to focus on modernizing their technology, utilizing data and enhancing the customer experience. The focus on digital channels by financial institutions, and the growing volume and types of payment transactions, elevates the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions, which we expect will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information, maintain regulatory compliance and offer innovative new services. We anticipate benefiting over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes in an evolving marketplace, and we believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks necessary to be competitive are essential to justify these investments. Our acquisitions of Online Banking Solutions, Inc., a provider of digital business banking solutions; the assets of PCLender, LLC, a leader in internet-based mortgage software and technology solutions; Dovetail Group Limited, a provider of bank payments and liquidity management solutions; and Monitise plc, a provider of digital solutions that enable innovative digital banking experiences, further enhance our technology resources, business process understanding and human resource capabilities. In connection with our integration efforts following the First Data acquisition, we have initiated data center consolidation and restructuring activities focused on reducing our overall cost structure, including vendor spend and the elimination of duplicate costs, to optimize operational effectiveness and support enhanced technology deployment. Our enterprise priorities include enhancing client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions and delivering innovation and integration to enable differentiated value through technology modernization and process optimization.

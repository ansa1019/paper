All da Vinci systems include a surgeon’s console (or consoles), imaging electronics, a patient-side cart, and computational hardware and software, and we offer advanced instrumentation for the Da Vinci Xi and Da Vinci X platforms, including the Da Vinci vessel sealer extend and stapler products, to provide surgeons with sophisticated, computer-aided tools to precisely and efficiently interact with tissue. Within our integrated ecosystem, our products are designed to decrease variability in surgery by offering dependable, consistent functionality and user experiences for surgeons seeking better outcomes, and we take a holistic approach offering intelligent technology and systems designed to work together to make minimally invasive surgery intervention more available and applicable. Training technologies include our intuitive simulation products, our intuitive telepresence remote case observation and telementoring tools, and our dual console for use in surgeon proctoring and collaborative surgery. Iris is a service that delivers a 3D image of the patient anatomy to aid surgeons in both pre- and intra-operative settings. The Ion endoluminal system uses an ultra-thin articulating robotic catheter that can move 180 degrees in all directions to reach peripheral nodules for biopsies; the Ion system’s flexible biopsy needle can also pass through very tight bends via Ion’s catheter to collect tissue in the peripheral lung.

The Company’s discussion highlights its focus on developing and commercializing its own technologies and making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses, reflecting the deployment and integration of technology resources in support of its business strategies. It explains that its “strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, focused research projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience,” implicitly underscoring its evolving coordination of assets, processes and interfirm relationships through digital and infrastructure enhancements. The Company further attributes productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, to its practical process improvement (PPI) business system, global sourcing initiatives and facility consolidations, which implicitly involve information management and process-redesign capabilities to improve cost efficiencies and operational flexibility.

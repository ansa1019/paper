Bristol-Myers Squibb has undertaken integration efforts across general and administrative, manufacturing, R&D, procurement and streamlining the company’s pricing and information technology infrastructure, targeting approximately $2.5 billion of cost savings and avoidance through 2022, an initiative that implicitly leverages IT capability to coordinate assets, internal processes and interfirm transactions. Through its operating model transformation, the company continues to evolve its commercial infrastructure to deliver leaner administrative functions, streamline its manufacturing network and focus commercial, R&D and manufacturing resources on prioritized brands and markets, thereby deploying IT resources in support of strategic flexibility and operational efficiency. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are managed through global enabling functions including finance, legal, information technology and human resources, and R&D expense allocations explicitly include facilities and information technology costs, reflecting the firm’s mobilization of IT-based resources across business processes. In response to an SEC consent order, the company established a formal review and certification process for its SEC filings, created a business risk and disclosure group and retained an outside consultant to re-engineer its accounting and financial reporting processes—measures that depend on enhanced IT systems to monitor distribution channel inventory levels, escalate compliance questions to appropriate management levels and ensure timely resolution, thus underpinning the firm’s strategic decision-making, resource allocation and interfirm coordination.

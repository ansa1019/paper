In 2019 we significantly increased our investments in digital capabilities, including our Marcus by Goldman Sachs platform, as well as the planned launch of transaction banking, and incurred higher expenses for consolidated investments and technology—primarily depreciation and amortization, communications and technology and computing services—which, together with increased professional fees, contributed to approximately $700 million of pre-tax digital platform losses. Technology and communications costs rose to $1.17 billion in 2019 (up from $1.02 billion in 2018) as headcount increased 5 percent driven by a growth in technology professionals, and our digital lending and deposit platform likewise generated higher expenses. We manage technology-related risks under the Firmwide Resilience and Operational Risk Committee, with dedicated information and cyber security policies to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems, rigorous third-party and cloud-service oversight, and a business continuity framework designed to ensure operational resilience in the event of technology disruptions.

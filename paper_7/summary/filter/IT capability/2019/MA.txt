Mastercard describes itself as a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks. Through its unique and proprietary global payments network, referred to as its core network, Mastercard switches (authorizes, clears and settles) payment transactions and delivers related products and services, while providing additional payment capabilities including automated clearing house transactions in both batch and real-time account-based payments. The company also provides integrated value-added offerings such as cyber and intelligence products, information and analytics services, consulting, loyalty and reward programs and processing, all designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments system. Growth in other revenues was primarily driven by these cyber & intelligence and data & services solutions, reflecting the firm’s ongoing investment in strategic initiatives and its ability to deploy and leverage technology resources. Operating expenses reflect continued investment in data processing and telecommunications infrastructure, while depreciation and amortization increases were driven by amortization of certain intangible assets and depreciation on data center assets. Mastercard manages foreign currency balance sheet remeasurement and transactional currency exposure through dedicated foreign exchange risk management activities, recording gains and losses on foreign exchange derivative contracts and remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, demonstrating its information management capabilities in support of global operations. Its revenue recognition for customer rebates and incentives further relies on estimates of customer performance—including forecasted transactions, card issuance and conversion volumes—underscoring the application of information management capability over contractual arrangements.

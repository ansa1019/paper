In our ongoing evaluation of planned technology node transitions, capital spending and equipment re‐use rates for NAND equipment, we continually align manufacturing technology investments with cost reduction and product enablement objectives. Our approach to developing new product and process technology relies on continued investment in manufacturing facilities, advanced equipment and research and development activities and on shared development agreements with partners, including joint efforts to develop 3D NAND and 3D XPoint technologies, thereby combining technology resources, external expertise and internal processes to support future growth and operational efficiencies. To support strategic decisions, we continuously evaluate funding alternatives for capital expenditures and operations, forecasting working capital requirements through systematic reviews of sales volumes, customer orders, pricing trends, seasonal factors and market demand analyses. Our inventory valuation processes involve projecting average selling prices and volumes based on internal and external market data, ensuring cost of goods sold reflects lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments. In assessing goodwill and intangible assets for impairment and in establishing critical accounting estimates—such as deferred tax assets, fair values of acquired assets and projected cash flows—we employ discounted cash flow models and risk‐adjusted discount rates grounded in long‐range financial planning, revenue growth forecasts and manufacturing cost assumptions. Revenue recognition is managed through point‐in‐time control assessments and variable consideration estimates for returns and price protection, supported by systematic information gathering and analysis of customer contracts and market conditions. Stock‐based compensation valuation and performance‐based award recognition utilize fair‐value models and probability assessments informed by historical data and market volatility metrics. Throughout these processes, management applies subjective and complex judgments, leveraging corporate governance frameworks and information management capabilities to mobilize financial and technology resources in support of strategic business objectives and operational effectiveness.

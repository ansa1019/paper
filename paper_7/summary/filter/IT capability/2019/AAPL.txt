During fiscal 2019, the company invested $7.6 billion in capital expenditures that included data centers and corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and enhancements, and its selling, general and administrative expenses growth was driven in part by higher spending on infrastructure-related costs, reflecting continued mobilization and deployment of IT-based resources to support business needs. Research and development expense increased 14% to $16.2 billion as the company “continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the company’s core business strategy,” underscoring the strategic role of technology capabilities and IT architecture in driving innovation and competitive advantage. In its manufacturing operations, the company utilizes demand information supplied to outsourcing partners under long-term agreements to secure inventory and coordinate production, an IT-enabled process that leverages information management capability and system integration to optimize resource allocation and supply chain coordination. The company’s revenue recognition model further illustrates its information systems capability, as it allocates revenue to hardware and bundled software delivered at sale, product-related services including iCloud, Siri and Maps, and unspecified future software upgrades based on estimated standalone selling prices, deferring and amortizing revenue over the periods services are expected to be provided. The adoption of new accounting standards on hedging (ASU 2017-12) and leases (ASU 2016-02) via the modified retrospective transition method will necessitate enhancements to financial reporting systems and processes. Managing reportable segments on a geographic basis and maintaining substantial balances of marketable securities, cash equivalents and commercial paper involve IT-supported decision-support systems for monitoring performance, managing risk and allocating liquidity across the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Commitments to noncancelable manufacturing purchase obligations and the recording of estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees depend on the firm’s information processing capacity and data analytics to assess product development plans and demand estimates. Finally, the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates—ranging from revenue deferral and valuation of manufacturing-related assets to warranty cost accruals and uncertain tax positions—rely on ongoing system enhancements, data management capabilities and process automation to ensure information accuracy, timeliness, reliability and compliance with evolving regulatory requirements.

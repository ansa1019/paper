Management’s discussion articulates the central role of technology in our competitive strategy, noting that artificial intelligence is transforming industries by creating personalized experiences, delivering data-driven insights and increasing service speed in an increasingly digitized and dynamic environment. Our growth strategy depends on initiating and embracing disruptive technology trends, entering new markets and driving broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market, supported by significant investments in product development, marketing and sales capabilities. As we expand online services—including QuickBooks Online and Advanced, QuickBooks Self-Employed, online payroll and merchant payment processing, TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live—the ongoing operation and availability of internal platforms, data centers and external systems have become increasingly important, motivating continued management attention and resource allocation to our information technology infrastructure and privacy and security capabilities. We have acquired technology-centric businesses such as TSheets, Exactor and Applatix to enhance our ecosystem—a development reflected in the amortization of acquired technology and intangible assets—and maintain capital commitments to digital transformation initiatives, data center operations and customer support frameworks, thereby reinforcing our IT capability to coordinate assets, processes and interfirm relationships in support of our strategic objectives.

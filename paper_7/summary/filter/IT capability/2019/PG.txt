Global Business Services (“GBS”) provides technology, processes and standard data tools to enable the Global Business Units, Selling & Market Operations and Corporate Functions to better understand the business and serve consumers and customers, reflecting P&G’s integrated IT architecture for coordinating its assets, internal processes and inter-firm relationships at a low capital cost. The company’s multi-year productivity and cost-savings initiatives—including supply chain optimization, outsourcing projects and overhead and workforce reduction—implicitly leverage technology resources to automate work processes, improve operational efficiency and support strategic cost management. Management’s use of vendor-purchased brick-and-mortar and online data combined with internal estimates to calculate market share and consumption underscores an information management capability that aims to deliver accurate, timely and reliable performance metrics. Recent organizational design changes that consolidate product categories into six Sector Business Units with responsibility for global brand strategy, innovation, supply chain and profitability further highlight the essential role of an integrated IT capability in enabling coordinated execution, data-driven decision-making and value creation across the firm’s business landscape.

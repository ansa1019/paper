Management’s discussion highlights strategic investments in manufacturing technologies and in-house capacity to directly control production and “invest in technology that differentiates the features of our products,” demonstrating the deployment and governance of technology resources; the firm’s extensive web presence and global sales and applications team provide unique access and insight to about 100,000 customers during their product selection and design-in journey, reflecting connectivity, information management capability, and support for customer relationships; purchase commitments explicitly include payments for software licenses and contractual arrangements with suppliers, indicating ongoing investments in technology infrastructure; the monitoring of operational metrics such as days sales outstanding and days of inventory and the use of non-GAAP measures like free cash flow and an annual operating tax rate illustrate management’s capability to generate, tailor, and leverage information for timely decision making, resource allocation, and performance evaluation.

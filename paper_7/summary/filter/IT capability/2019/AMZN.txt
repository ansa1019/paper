Management’s discussion and analysis emphasizes Amazon’s strategic mobilization and deployment of IT resources, noting that fixed costs include building and running its technology infrastructure, enhancing and adding features to online stores, web services, electronic devices and digital offerings, while variable costs encompass running AWS and related transaction costs. The company reports that technology and content costs—comprising payroll and related expenses for research and development teams, designers, software and hardware engineers and merchandising personnel, plus infrastructure costs such as servers, networking equipment, data center depreciation, rent, utilities and other expenses—reflect its investments to deliver a wide variety of products and services, enhance customer experience, and optimize process efficiencies at scale. It highlights that technology and content investment and capital spending projects often cross-support multiple offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of its systems and operations, and expects spending on technology and content to grow over time through the addition of specialized personnel and expanded infrastructure. Amazon underscores its focus on leveraging advances in processing power, wireless connectivity, artificial intelligence and machine learning to continuously improve customer performance and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. In addition, AWS, which provides a broad set of global compute, storage, database and other services to developers and enterprises of all sizes, benefits from cost-structure productivity investments, illustrating the firm’s ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources in support of its business strategies and work processes, thereby reinforcing its competitive positioning and value creation across internal and interfirm relationships.

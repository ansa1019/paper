In fiscal 2019, online sales generated through our websites for products picked up in stores or delivered to customer locations represented 9.3% of net sales and grew 19.4%, reflecting the deployment of digital technologies; the increase in comparable sales also reflected execution of strategic efforts to drive an enhanced interconnected experience in both the physical and digital worlds. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we shifted certain store support operations to remote or virtual platforms, which implicates mobilization of IT-based resources and associated software acquisitions and license commitments included under our purchase obligations. Cash used in investing activities primarily reflected $2.7 billion of capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 (and $2.4 billion in fiscal 2018) for investments in our business, and we expect approximately $2.8 billion in fiscal 2020â€”an amount we may adjust as necessary to support operations. We believe our cash position, operating cash flow, commercial paper programs and access to the long-term debt capital markets provide financial flexibility to fund these capital investments and support our organizational and digital capabilities.

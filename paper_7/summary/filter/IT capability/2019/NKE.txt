Nike’s management disclosed that selling and administrative expense increased due to “investments in data and analytics capabilities, digital commerce platforms and an initial investment in a new enterprise resource planning tool to accelerate our end-to-end digital transformation,” and that operating overhead rose “driven primarily by higher wage-related and administrative expenses, which reflect critical investments in innovation, data and analytics capabilities, digital commerce platforms and an initial investment in a new enterprise resource planning tool to accelerate our end-to-end digital transformation.” The report underscores the role of digital technologies in the consumer direct offense strategy, with “digital platforms” including “nike.com and related mobile applications” and “digital partner platforms” delivering “compelling consumer experiences” and outpacing all other channels with 35% growth in digital commerce sales. Global brand divisions’ operating overhead expense growth is attributed to “investments in data and analytics capabilities, digital commerce platforms and our initial investment in a new enterprise resource planning tool, all of which are in an effort to accelerate our end-to-end digital transformation,” while Converse’s operating overhead is described as supporting “investments in our digital business” and its demand creation expense driven by costs associated with “our digital platform.”

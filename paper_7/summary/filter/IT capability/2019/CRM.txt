In our management’s discussion and analysis, the company underscores its evolving IT capability by expanding its CRM technology with enhanced editions, features and platform capabilities and by uniting sales, service, marketing, commerce and analytics into its Customer 360 platform to provide a single source of information, thereby coordinating internal processes and interfirm relationships. Subscription and support revenues, derived principally from access to enterprise cloud computing services, reflect the deployment of IT resources in support of business strategies, while cost of subscription and support revenues is chiefly driven by the provision of data center capacity, third-party technology and support services, and employee-related costs. The company continues to invest in multi-cloud adoption, enterprise cloud computing services, data center capacity and internal system upgrades to scale operations, enhance operational flexibility and continuously evolve security measures, and it adds personnel to professional services and research and development teams—driving innovation in cloud, mobile, social, blockchain, voice and AI, extending analytics and integration capabilities and integrating acquisitions such as Mulesoft and Tableau—through a disciplined acquisition process that evaluates complementary businesses, technologies and intellectual property rights. These strategic management practices facilitate the adoption and tailoring of services, support timely and reliable information delivery, and strengthen IT governance via substantial cybersecurity programs and privacy compliance resources to assist customers in meeting GDPR and CCPA requirements, all of which enhance the firm’s competence to reconfigure IT resources and leverage them alongside other organizational capabilities in pursuit of business transformation and competitive advantage.

Visa describes itself as “a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories,” facilitating global commerce “through the transfer of value and information among a global network of consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities.” Central to this is its advanced transaction processing network, VisaNet, which “enables authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions” and supports financial institution and merchant clients with “a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services.” Data processing revenues are “earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, value-added services, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally.” Operating expenses include “network and processing expenses” for the operation of its processing network, encompassing maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services, as well as depreciation and amortization of purchased and internally developed software. In fiscal 2019, capital expenditures “increased due to investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives,” and the company states that it “expects to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives,” reflecting its ongoing commitment to acquire, deploy and enhance IT resources in support of its business strategies and processes.

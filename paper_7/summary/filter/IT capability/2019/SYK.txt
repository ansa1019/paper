In 2019 we adopted the ASC 606 revenue recognition standard, translating current and prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rates to remove currency impacts and updating our information processes accordingly; we supplement GAAP results with a suite of non-GAAP financial measures—including percentage sales growth in constant and organic currency, adjusted gross profit, adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, adjusted research, development and engineering expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted effective income tax rate, adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share—and provide detailed reconciliations to support trend analysis in our budget process and management incentive compensation; management employs these standardized metrics to review segment operating results and analyze potential future business trends; we engage third-party valuation specialists and apply an income-based approach, using forecasted cash flows and appropriate discount rates, to estimate fair values and assign useful lives to intangible assets acquired in business combinations, while indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill are tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level based on the present value of estimated future cash flows; our global cash management strategy integrates liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations to generate substantial operating cash flow, fund acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases and to access capital markets at competitive rates; we maintain and evaluate debt levels by considering cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans and overall cost of capital, supplemented by a commercial paper program and existing credit facilities; we evaluate uncertain income tax positions and deferred tax assets in accordance with applicable guidance on uncertainty in income taxes, relying on judgments about future outcomes and adjusting reserves as tax audits progress; and we review other long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that carrying amounts may not be recoverable, and we record liabilities for probable losses in legal, recall, restructuring and integration-related contingencies based on management’s best estimates.

The increase in our selling, general and administrative expense ratio to 17.9% in fiscal 2020 from 17.8% in fiscal 2019 reflects wage increases and incremental systems and technology costs partially offset by the expense leverage on strong comparable-store sales; similarly, segment profit margin for our international operations was partially offset by incremental systems and technology costs and wage increases despite robust comp sales growth. Net sales from our e-commerce businesses accounted for approximately 2% of total sales and approximately 3% of Marmaxx segment net sales in both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, and our newest e-commerce website, www.marshalls.com, introduced during fiscal 2020, did not have a significant impact on year-over-year segment profit margin comparisons. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we closed all of our stores, our online businesses, our distribution centers and our offices, with associates working remotely where possible. To mitigate Brexit-related trade disruptions, our European division realigned its supply chain to reduce the volume of merchandise flowing between the UK and the EU and established resources and systems to support this plan.

Management’s discussion and analysis emphasizes the firm’s information management capability through the systematic presentation and reconciliation of financial and operating metrics, noting that “information on 2017 is included in graphs only to show year over year trends,” that it “evaluates our business operations based on the NOI of our two operating segments,” and that “NOI by segment is a non-GAAP performance measure that is calculated using revenues and expenses directly from our financial statements” which “helps management and investors understand our operating results.” The MD&A describes its methodologies for calculating key metrics such as net effective rent change, same-store property NOI and development completions by comparing period-over-period NOI, translating local currencies into U.S. dollars at period-end rates, and allocating property management and leasing costs based on square footage. It further discloses its use of non-GAAP performance measures—including “funds from operations attributable to common stockholders/unitholders (FFO), FFO as modified by Prologis and core FFO”—and provides detailed reconciling items such as gains on dispositions of development properties, depreciation and amortization, foreign currency and derivative gains or losses, and current and deferred income tax impacts. Collectively, these disclosures illustrate the firm’s ability to acquire, process and tailor information with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability and comparability in support of strategic decision-making, resource allocation and performance evaluation.

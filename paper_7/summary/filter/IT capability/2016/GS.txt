The firm describes a comprehensive risk management and capital planning framework designed to maintain operations and positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including detailed governance structures, business continuity planning, contingency funding and resolution plans, and independent control and support functions that regularly monitor, evaluate and manage liquidity, market, credit, operational and model risks. It holds substantial Global Core Liquid Assets in unencumbered high-quality securities to cover potential cash and collateral outflows in stress, actively manages secured and unsecured funding tenors and counterparty concentrations, and maintains internal liquidity models and intraday liquidity stress tests to size liquidity buffers. Its capital planning incorporates forward-looking severely adverse scenarios, CCAR and DFAST stress tests, and limits on balance sheet assets and risk-weighted exposures to ensure compliance with minimum CET1, total capital and supplementary leverage requirements even after hypothetical losses. Daily Value-at-Risk reporting, regular sensitivity and scenario analyses across interest rate, equity, currency and commodity risk factors, and event-driven sovereign and systemic stress tests help identify potential loss concentrations and guide adaptive hedging and resource reallocation. Rigorous counterparty credit reviews, netting and collateral arrangements, underwriting standards, and lending-commitment controls mitigate defaults, while operational risk self-assessments, control testing, escalation protocols and independent audit of internal controls preserve system integrity in the face of process failures, system outages or legal and regulatory pressures. A firmwide network of committees—spanning new activities, reputational risk, suitability, capital commitments, model risk control and operational resilience—ensures rapid escalation and coordinated response to disruptive events, enabling the firm to absorb strain, preserve functioning and emerge stronger from adversity.

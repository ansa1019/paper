Management makes assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, regularly evaluates these assumptions and discusses them with the Audit Committee to maintain operational integrity under changing conditions. In response to evolving customer and market expectations, we frequently expand and improve our technology to keep up with the pace of change, integrating acquired businesses such as Fotolia and TubeMogul into our digital media and marketing segments to support business continuity and preserve or improve functioning. We allocate resources to operate our network infrastructure and manage deferred revenue and unbilled backlog through continuous assessment of billing cycles, customer renewals and market dynamics. To mitigate external pressures, we employ a currency hedging program and interest rate swaps to offset foreign currency and interest rate impacts on revenue and interest expense. Strategic investments in research and development and the shift to subscription-based models, coupled with multi-element revenue arrangements and targeted sales and marketing initiatives, enhance our operational flexibility, adaptability to environmental disruptions and competitive position. Our liquidity and capital resources, including cash, cash equivalents, investments, a $1 billion revolving credit facility and monitoring of contractual obligations and covenant compliance, are positioned to support ongoing working capital, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions and the preservation of system resilience and performance maintenance under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

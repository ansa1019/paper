Starbucks’ fiscal 2016 results continued to demonstrate the strength of its global business model and its ability to successfully make disciplined investments in its business and its partners (employees), as operating margin expansion was primarily driven by sales leverage and lower commodity costs, partially offset by investments in partners and digital platforms. The company’s segment results reflected operational adaptability under external pressures, as margin expansion in China/Asia Pacific was driven by sales leverage, higher income from joint venture operations and favorability from changes to certain business tax structures, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and the impact of its ownership change in Starbucks Japan, while the EMEA segment managed portfolio fragmentation between company-operated and licensed stores to offset revenue declines from currency fluctuations. Through beverage innovation, including the growth in iced beverages paired with food offerings, and the expansion of customer occasions outside of retail stores via the Channel Development segment, Starbucks has pursued service innovation and strategic initiatives to reinforce long-term growth potential. Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, the company expects results to be driven by its seven strategies for growth—be the employer of choice, elevate coffee, grow the store portfolio, create new customer occasions, drive at-home coffee share and occasions, build Teavana through Starbucks and CPG, and extend digital engagement—while continuing to expand its footprint by opening new stores and enhancing store mix, aligning leadership with evolving businesses such as its global roastery and Starbucks Reserve® branded stores, and making targeted capital expenditures and partner and digital investments to support ongoing growth initiatives. To manage environmental perturbations in commodity markets, Starbucks employs a market price risk management policy that limits speculative activities, uses pricing features in supply contracts and financial derivatives to mitigate coffee and dairy price volatility, and hedges foreign currency exposures related to intercompany royalties, inventory purchases and balance sheet translation risks. The company actively manages its cash and investments—held primarily in highly liquid, available-for-sale securities including government treasuries and corporate debt—to internally fund operating needs, service its borrowings, pursue acquisitions and return cash to shareholders, believing that future cash flows and existing resources will be sufficient to finance capital requirements and shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future, thereby preserving business continuity and maintaining performance under challenging conditions.

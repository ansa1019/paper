Danaher’s 2016 MD&A emphasizes a global, diversified business model and a systematic operating framework to maintain performance under varied pressures. Management reports that its geographic and industry diversity, together with a broad range of products and services, “help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results,” while individual businesses monitor competitors, customers and general economic trends to gauge future performance. The company discloses significant investments—both organic and through acquisitions—in sales growth initiatives, research and development, globalized manufacturing and customer-facing resources to improve responsiveness and operational efficiency in high-growth markets. Through the application of the Danaher Business System and recurring restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives, the firm achieves incremental cost savings, enhances operating margins and secures cost synergies as acquired businesses such as Pall and Cepheid are integrated. Liquidity and capital resources are managed by generating substantial operating cash flow, maintaining undrawn credit facilities and accessing commercial paper and note issuances to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service and dividends under variable interest-rate and foreign-exchange environments. The company addresses market risks—including interest rate, currency, commodity price and credit risk—via its broad-based operations, partial hedging with foreign-currency debt and disciplined working capital management to preserve cash conversion cycles. Ongoing evaluations of contingent liabilities for litigation, regulatory and tax audits, together with funding of defined-benefit pension plans, demonstrate reserve planning and risk mitigation consistent with preserving system integrity and sustaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

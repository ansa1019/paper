The company’s MD&A describes a comprehensive risk management program and governance framework designed to identify, measure, monitor and mitigate operational, credit, market, liquidity and compliance risks, including specific policies and procedures, periodic risk and control self-assessments, control testing programs, internal audit reviews and insurance to contain operational losses; a backup and recovery infrastructure with geographically dispersed facilities and routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans to minimize business interruptions; an information security program that “knits together complementary tools, controls and technologies” to protect systems, client accounts and data and continuously monitor cyber threats; oversight of external vendors through contractual provisions and ongoing performance monitoring; governance for model risk with centralized registration, classification and stakeholder accountability; policies and controls to discharge fiduciary obligations faithfully; collateral arrangements and credit limits to manage margin, pledged asset and loan exposures; net interest revenue simulations and asset-liability management that position the firm to “benefit from an increase in interest rates” while limiting exposure to falling rates; regular liquidity stress testing against contingency funding scenarios, including the modified LCR rule, to ensure sufficient liquidity over a 30-day horizon; ongoing capital stress testing, internal capital contingency plans and maintenance of regulatory capital buffers, including tier 1 leverage and risk-based ratios well above required thresholds; and compliance with regulatory “recovery planning” guidelines requiring restoration of financial health under a wide range of external and internal financial and operational stress scenarios—all of which reflect the firm’s ability to absorb strain, preserve integrity and maintain performance under challenging conditions.

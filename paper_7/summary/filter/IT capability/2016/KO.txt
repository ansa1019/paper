Management’s discussion identifies a range of “challenges and risks” that demand our sustained attention and strategic response, including obesity, water quality and quantity, evolving consumer preferences, competition, product safety and quality, and food security, each of which can threaten our ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.  For example, water is described as “a limited natural resource facing unprecedented challenges,” and the Company “regularly assesses the specific water-related risks that we and many of our bottling partners face” and “has implemented a formal water risk management program,” with mitigation of water risk forming “the basis of our water stewardship strategic framework” through water-use efficiency, watershed protection, community engagement and supply-chain management.  Similarly, our “rigorous product and ingredient safety and quality standards” are enforced through an “integrated quality management program that continually measures all operations within the Coca-Cola system against the same stringent standards, and … identifies and mitigates risks and drives improvement,” demonstrating our capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning.  Under food security, we commit to a “sustainable sourcing commitment … founded on principles that protect the environment, uphold workplace rights and help build more sustainable communities,” collaborating with farmers, suppliers and partners and investing in sustainable agriculture to help secure ingredient availability and strengthen community resilience.  Our description of financial strength—“we believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths” and “we have significant flexibility to meet our financial commitments”—along with a “foreign currency management program … designed to mitigate, over time, a portion of the impact of exchange rate changes on our net income and earnings per share,” underscores our operational and financial flexibility in the face of external pressures.  Finally, the multi-year productivity and reinvestment program—originally designed in 2012 “to strengthen our brands and reinvest our resources to drive long-term profitable growth” through “global supply chain optimization; global marketing and innovation effectiveness; operating expense leverage and operational excellence; data and information technology systems standardization; and the integration of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.’s former North America business,” and expanded in 2014 through 2019 to include “restructuring the company’s global supply chain, implementing zero-based work, streamlining and simplifying the company’s operating model and driving increased discipline and efficiency in direct marketing investments”—serves as a clear embodiment of our strategic resilience, enabling us to foresee, confront and benefit from disruptive change to survive, grow and flourish.

Our management’s discussion and analysis describes how we enable systemic resilience through vertical integration that “brings together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, libraries, systems and services to create unique value,” and how we commit to inventory purchases based on demand forecasts while “accounting for our third-party manufacturers’ lead times and constraints” and “adjusting to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions” to preserve performance under variable conditions. We maintain continuous evaluation of critical accounting estimates—including revenue recognition, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, cash equivalents and marketable securities—“on an on-going basis” by basing our assumptions on historical experience and reasonable projections to mitigate risk. Our investment policy requires “high grade investment securities, the diversification of asset types and certain limits on our portfolio duration,” and we believe that “our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months.” We have arranged an off-balance-sheet, build-to-suit operating lease for our new headquarters—under which the lease balance remains static at completed cost, we retain options to purchase or sell the building, and our aggregate guarantee is limited to 87.5% of construction costs—and established a revolving credit facility through October 2021 to support working capital and general corporate purposes. We manage liquidity by issuing and retiring convertible and non-convertible notes, prefunding repayments with net proceeds, and by returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases “subject to continued capital availability and our board’s continuing determination.” We monitor cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities—where “operating activities increased primarily driven by an increase in net income and changes in working capital,” and “investing activities increased … due to higher purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets”—to reconfigure our resource deployment and maintain operational flexibility. Finally, we recognize that “losses in pending litigation, investigations or settlements” and “the fair values of our reporting units” involve significant judgments and assumptions, underscoring our approach to risk assessment, adaptation and performance maintenance under external pressures.

Mastercard continually monitors political and economic conditions around the world to identify growth opportunities and assess the evolution of the global payments industry, recognizing that distress in financial markets, turmoil in specific economies, government intervention and political instability can impose risks that may accelerate or increase the impact of adverse economic conditions on its financial performance. To maintain operational continuity and absorb settlement strain, the company guarantees the settlement of Mastercard, Cirrus and Maestro-branded transactions and maintains a committed $3.75 billion revolving credit facility, a commercial paper program and substantial cash, cash equivalents and investment securities balances, which, together with its cash flow–generating capabilities, it deems sufficient to fund global operations, credit and settlement exposures, capital expenditures and potential obligations. Management separately monitors significant one-time litigation judgments and pension settlement charges by excluding them from non-GAAP financial measures used for internal planning, forecasting and performance-based compensation, thereby preserving positive adjustment under challenging conditions. To manage foreign currency exposure, Mastercard employs foreign exchange risk management activities—recording gains and losses on derivatives as exposures materialize—and presents currency-neutral growth rates by remeasuring prior periods at current exchange rates. The company’s continued investment in strategic initiatives and personnel to support digital capabilities, data analytics, services and geographic expansion, alongside capacity enhancements to its network infrastructure and data processing systems, reflects a systemic commitment to adaptability, resource reallocation and improved functioning amid external pressures and operational demands.

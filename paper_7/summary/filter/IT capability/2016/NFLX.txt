Consolidated revenues increased 30% in 2016 due to growth in paid streaming memberships globally, reflecting our international expansion and focus on Netflix as a global Internet TV network, and the increase in operating income and net income was driven primarily by rising revenues partially offset by higher content expenses as we continue to acquire, license and produce content—including more Netflix originals—and by increased marketing and headcount costs to support our global scaling. We have built our own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the Internet, demonstrating our commitment to system resilience and operational continuity under internal and external variations. Technology and development expenses rose 31% year-over-year, driven by a $162.3 million increase in personnel-related costs to support improvements in our streaming service, recommendation engine, merchandising and streaming infrastructure, and by third-party cloud computing costs, reflecting our investment in service innovation and infrastructure adaptability. General and administrative expenses increased 42% primarily due to a 39% increase in average headcount to support our international expansion and original content production, augmented by higher facilities-related costs, highlighting our strategic resource allocation to maintain organizational functioning under growth pressures. In October 2016 we issued $1.0 billion of long-term debt, and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased by $576.9 million, as we balanced liquidity and capital resources to fund significant upfront investments in streaming content while preserving sufficient funds and access to financing sources to meet cash needs for at least the next twelve months. We define free cash flow as cash provided by (used in) operating and investing activities excluding non-operational cash flows from short-term investments, noting that cash used in operating activities increased primarily due to a 49% rise in payments for streaming content assets, partially offset by a 30% revenue increase, and that free cash flow serves as a key liquidity metric for assessing our ability to repay debt, invest in content and support ongoing operations. Contractual obligations for streaming content increased by $3.6 billion to $14.5 billion at December 31, 2016, reflecting multi-year commitments for exclusive and original programming and the anticipated financial outlays for content acquisitions and production. Our critical accounting policies—particularly the capitalization and amortization of content assets over contractual windows or estimated periods of use, the regular review of amortization estimates in light of viewing patterns, deferred tax asset measurement and recognition of uncertain tax positions, and the estimation of stock-based compensation based on implied volatility and exercise behavior—require significant judgment and ensure that our financial reporting remains accurate and that our organizational resilience is supported by transparent, adaptable accounting practices.

Management’s discussion emphasizes our ability to maintain operational continuity and adapt under challenging and rapidly changing conditions by investing in infrastructure, security, and strategic resources.  As noted, “as we continue transitioning to offer more connected services, the ongoing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important,” and “we are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.”  In response to a rise in fraudulent tax filings, we “implemented additional security measures in our products and began working with state governments to share information regarding suspicious filings while continuing to share such information with the federal government,” and we “continue to invest in security and to work with the broader industry and government to protect our customers against this type of fraud.”  To ensure resilience against seasonal and economic fluctuations, management asserts that “we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, commitments, debt service requirements, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months,” and that our “strong liquidity profile enables us to respond nimbly” to acquisitions and strategic investments.  We also describe ongoing risk assessment and mitigation practices, including “monitor[ing] counterparty risk” under our credit facility, quarterly reassessment of deferred tax asset realizability based on estimated future taxable income, and judicious judgments in critical accounting estimates to preserve performance and flexibility despite external pressures.

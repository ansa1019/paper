Management’s discussion cautions that forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially, reflecting the organization’s need to anticipate and adapt to external pressures; in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, Qualcomm announced a strategic realignment plan designed to improve execution, enhance financial performance and drive profitable growth, including targeted cost reduction initiatives across its businesses and $202 million in restructuring charges by the end of fiscal 2016; during fiscal 2016, the Company executed a capital return program, repurchasing $3.9 billion of common stock and distributing $3.0 billion in dividends, while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility through a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility, a $4.0 billion commercial paper program and the issuance of $10 billion in floating- and fixed-rate notes, in anticipation of the $38 billion proposed acquisition of NXP Semiconductors that will require substantial deployment of cash held by foreign entities, new debt and significant management resources; the Company continues to navigate competitive dynamics—such as concentration of device share in the premium tier, intense competition in China and potential underreporting by certain licensees—through enhanced compliance efforts, negotiations and, where necessary, litigation to secure royalty reporting and revenue; Qualcomm persists in strategic investments and innovation, allocating resources to 4G LTE and 5G technologies, converged computing/communications chips, RF front-end, connectivity, multimedia, software and services, as well as to new industries including automotive, the Internet of Things, data centers, networking, mobile health and machine learning, and formed a joint venture with TDK to deliver RF front-end modules—transactions that illustrate the firm’s capacity to reconfigure its resource base and reconstitute trajectories for future growth; to support operational continuity and absorb potential strain, the Company holds $32.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, closely manages accounts receivable and inventories, and maintains purchase obligations of $4.2 billion for near-term research, development and manufacturing commitments; in its consolidated financial statements, Qualcomm applies critical accounting estimates for impairment of marketable securities, valuation of other investments, inventory recoverability, goodwill and long-lived assets, legal contingencies and income taxes—judgments that acknowledge environmental perturbations, internal and external variations and the possibility of material adjustments—demonstrating an integrated perspective on risk assessment, resource allocation and organizational adaptation to maintain performance under challenging conditions.

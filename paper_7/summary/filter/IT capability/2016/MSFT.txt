In fiscal year 2016, Microsoft focused on transforming our organization to support our strategy of building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world, achieving product development milestones, implementing organizational changes, and making strategic and tactical moves to support our ambitions of reinventing productivity and business processes, building the intelligent cloud platform, and creating more personal computing. We announced a change in organizational structure to align to our strategic direction as a productivity and platform company and recast our internal management reporting to better allocate resources and assess performance, thereby enabling more effective resource deployment and operational flexibility. Recognizing that our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models, we must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment, and we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers, industry trends, and competitive forces. We sold and restructured our phone business, including divestitures, goodwill and asset impairment charges, employee severance expenses, and contract terminations, to better focus and align resources and reinforce our strategy of creating a vibrant Windows ecosystem, and we continue to streamline our smartphone hardware business to drive competitive advantage. We manage risks and enhance our financial resilience through derivative instruments to address foreign currency, equity price, interest rate, and credit risks, maintain robust accounting and internal control systems with periodic oversight by management, the audit committee, and independent auditors, and ensure liquidity and business continuity with cash, cash equivalents, investments, committed short-term and long-term financing, and a defined share repurchase program. We anticipate capital expenditures will increase to support our productivity and platform strategy—adding new facilities, datacenters, and systems—while maintaining sufficient domestic and foreign cash flows and access to capital markets to fund operating activities, cash commitments, and strategic initiatives such as the planned acquisition of LinkedIn, which is expected to accelerate growth and reconfigure our trajectory toward future opportunities.

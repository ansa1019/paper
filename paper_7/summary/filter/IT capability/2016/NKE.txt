Nikeâ€™s management discusses a comprehensive set of strategic and operational initiatives that support its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions, including sustained investments in technologies that automate and optimize its supply chain to reduce waste, increase speed to market and customize products; a centrally managed foreign exchange risk program that combines natural portfolio offsets, forward contracts and options to mitigate translation and transaction exposures; disciplined working capital management and liquidity strategies, including a committed credit facility, commercial paper program and substantial cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to sustain operational continuity amid volatile currency markets; ongoing capital deployment to expand direct-to-consumer store networks and digital capabilities, build infrastructure in key growth regions and fund targeted marketing and operational infrastructure projects; a hedging framework that defers the impact of exchange-rate movements on costs and earnings; brand, category and geographies-level performance tracking that guides resource allocation across multiple business environments; proactive product cost controls through a foreign currency adjustment program with suppliers; dynamic financial planning and forecasting tools for managing futures orders and cash flows; a robust risk-management structure to address foreign-currency, credit and interest-rate exposures; and a disciplined approach to share repurchases and dividends that balances shareholder returns with resilience against macroeconomic pressures.

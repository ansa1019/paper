As described in Managementâ€™s Discussion and Analysis, AMD continued to focus on its strategy to improve its business and strengthen its competitive position, making progress toward financial stability by closely managing operating expenses, reducing its debt and extending its debt maturities, including the issuance of $805 million of 2.125% convertible senior notes and subsequent repayment of $230 million under its secured revolving line of credit and repurchase of high-cost notes, actions reflecting resource allocation and risk mitigation under challenging conditions. The company executed its roadmap by delivering new products and technologies across its computing and graphics and enterprise, embedded and semi-custom segments, forging joint ventures in China and establishing a comprehensive framework for technology collaboration with GlobalFoundries to increase operational flexibility in wafer sourcing, all measures that reconfigure its supply chain, foster inter-organizational collaboration and support business continuity. As part of its ongoing efforts to simplify its business and align resources with strategic priorities, AMD implemented multi-phase restructuring plans in 2014 and 2015 to reduce global headcount, outsource IT services, exit the dense server systems business and optimize its real estate footprint, while licensing portions of its intellectual property to a China JV under milestone-based agreements and providing engineering and technical support, actions that enhance absorptive capacity and preserve functioning under internal and external perturbations. In managing liquidity, AMD recognized net cash provided by operating activities of $90 million in 2016 versus a use of $226 million in 2015 due to lower operating expenses, licensing gains, timing of collections and cost-plus arrangements with its ATMP joint venture, and maintained cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion, with availability under its secured revolving line of credit, underscoring its preparedness and positive adjustment under market volatility. The company further demonstrated systemic resilience through annual goodwill impairment analyses, inventory valuation processes based on projected sales outlook and lower of cost or market assessments, and rigorous critical accounting estimates including revenue allowances, discount rate determinations based on weighted-average cost of capital and debt covenants compliance, all designed to maintain integrity and performance in a turbulent business environment.

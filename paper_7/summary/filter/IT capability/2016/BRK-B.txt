We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis, with essentially no centralized sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources functions and minimal involvement by corporate headquarters in day-to-day activities, while our senior corporate management team remains ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities, chief executive selection and the establishment and monitoring of governance practices, including the communication of appropriate “tone at the top.”  Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities that enable us to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity, declining business when prices are inadequate yet remaining prepared to write substantially more business when appropriate prices can be attained.  We believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and insist on safety over yield, holding significant cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury bills, and our board has authorized share repurchases only so long as such actions will not reduce liquidity below $20 billion, reflecting our commitment to financial strength and redundant liquidity.  Our insurance operations acknowledge that the timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in underwriting results and that periodic results may include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and have adopted risk-mitigation practices—such as securing future energy supply and sales at fixed prices through forwards, futures, options, swaps and other agreements—and adjust employment levels and productivity initiatives in response to weakening customer demand.  Capital expenditures are forecasted to be funded by cash flows from operations and debt issuances, with BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy modeling future spending within a framework of long-term demand outlooks—for example, lower U.S. and global coal consumption—and with an emphasis on maintaining system integrity.  These policies and practices have underpinned consolidated shareholders’ equity of $283.0 billion at December 31, 2016, reflecting our ability to foresee, confront and benefit from sudden disruptive changes to survive, grow and flourish.

Throughout the period, Vertex has maintained its financial strength while discovering, developing, manufacturing and commercializing medicines for serious diseases using precision medicine approaches, balancing the risks inherent in drug development by pursuing research in diverse areas to support future pipeline formation and entering into strategic collaborations to in-license and develop drug candidates that enhance our research capabilities. We closely monitor the results of discovery, research, clinical trials and nonclinical studies, frequently evaluating our programs in light of new data and scientific, business and commercial insights and, as warranted, making abrupt changes in focus and priorities to adapt resource allocation and preserve operational performance. Our corporate compliance program is designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through compliance policies and systems, while substantial management and other resources are dedicated to securing and maintaining appropriate reimbursement levels in the United States and ex-U.S. markets to support business continuity. We manage inventory capitalization and recoverability assessments of in-process and drug supply inventories, estimating rebates, chargebacks, discounts and product returns based on evolving information and writing down excess or obsolete inventory to net realizable value when necessary. Our financing strategy leverages existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash flows from product sales, a five-year $500.0 million revolving credit facility permitting repayment and reborrowing without penalty, potential incremental commitments, public and private equity and debt offerings, and collaborative funding to ensure sufficient liquidity over the next twelve months and to respond to evolving capital requirements. We account for and consolidate variable interest entities with significant in-process research and development assets and contingent milestone, royalty and option payments, evaluating control, fair value assumptions and restructuring estimates quarterly, thereby preserving system integrity and adaptability under internal or external disturbances. We also maintain multiyear facility lease commitments, capital leases and contractual obligations, applying proactive risk assessment and periodic reassessment of lease and performance metrics, which together support organizational resilience through resource reconfiguration, governance mechanisms and financial and operational flexibility under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

We introduced our un-carrier strategy in 2013 with the objective of eliminating customer pain points from the unnecessary complexity of the wireless communication industry and, together with ongoing network improvements, this initiative has successfully attracted and retained customers, as evidenced by continued branded customer growth and improvements in churn metrics. On September 1, 2016, we sold certain marketing and distribution rights to an MVNO partner, transferring 1.7 million branded customers and prospectively recording their revenues within wholesale, a transaction that also yielded improvements in branded postpaid phone churn. During 2016, a handset OEM recall prompted us to record no revenue on the affected devices, impair them to net realizable value, and recognize related receivables for OEM reimbursements to mitigate financial impact. Lower equipment losses in 2016 primarily reflected higher lease revenues from our Jump! on Demand program, under which the cost of leased wireless devices is capitalized and depreciated over the lease term instead of expensing devices at delivery. Network expansion and build-out of our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses increased related service-cost and employee expenses but were partially offset by synergies from decommissioning the MetroPCS CDMA network, demonstrating our capacity to reconfigure network assets in response to evolving technological and competitive pressures. We expect 2017 cash capital expenditures for property and equipment to be in the range of $4.8 billion to $5.1 billion—front-end loaded to complete our 700 MHz build-out—and any additional investment in low-band spectrum licenses acquired through the FCC auction would be funded primarily through cash on hand and borrowings, potentially increasing our debt levels. We determine future liquidity requirements based on projected financial and operating performance, general economic conditions, the competitive landscape and spectrum acquisition opportunities, and regularly update these projections to assess risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our cash needs. To maintain financial resilience, our principal sources of liquidity—cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flow, long-term debt, capital leases, equity issuances, receivables-financing arrangements and an unsecured revolving credit facility—are expected, excluding any spectrum acquisition funding, to meet our business-operations requirements for at least the next 12 months, and we may opportunistically seek additional long-term debt to support spectrum purchases or debt refinancing. In 2015, we also established a revolving receivables sale facility for certain equipment-installment plan accounts to enhance liquidity, and as of December 31, 2016, we remained in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants.

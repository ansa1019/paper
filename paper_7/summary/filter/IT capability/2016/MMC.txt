Management’s discussion highlights the company’s resilience through its risk and insurance services segment, which “includes risk management activities (risk advice, risk transfer and risk control and mitigation solutions)” and its consulting segment’s specialized management, economic and brand consulting services, demonstrating an ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under varying market constraints; the company underscores operational flexibility in managing external pressures such as significant foreign exchange headwinds by isolating underlying revenue growth, executing cost controls that limited operating expense increases to 1%, and delivering 10% operating income growth in 2016; it maintains business continuity and liquidity by repatriating non-U.S. earnings while permanently investing $850 million of foreign cash for working capital needs, utilizing a $1.5 billion multi-currency unsecured revolving credit facility alongside a short-term commercial paper program, and generating $2.0 billion of operating cash flows in 2016; strategic resource allocation is evident in the completion of multiple acquisitions (nine in risk and insurance services and six in consulting during 2016) and corporate transformation initiatives—including the merger of Mercer’s investment and retirement businesses to align global capabilities, strengthening cyber security protections, and modernizing office facilities—to reconstitute its service portfolio and emerge stronger; pension plan amendments and re-measurements under U.S. GAAP, such as terminating U.S. defined benefit accruals and introducing automatic defined contribution contributions, reflect proactive risk mitigation and adaptation of benefits management; dynamic capital structure management through targeted share repurchases, dividend increases, debt issuances with staggered maturities and contingent consideration funding supports the maintenance of integrity and performance under internal and external variations; ongoing monitoring of legal and other loss contingencies via case-level reviews and internal actuarial analysis ensures preparedness for potential errors and claims; and investments in technology and capitalized software developments, coupled with enhancements to accounting methodologies, reinforce systemic resilience and future orientation.

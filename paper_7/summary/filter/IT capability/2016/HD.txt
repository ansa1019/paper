In fiscal 2016, the company enhanced its organizational resilience by continuing to invest in interconnected capabilities to meet evolving customer demands, completing the deployment of its new COM platform across all U.S. stores and rolling out the BODFS program built on that foundation, which, together with BOPIS and BOSS offerings, enabled approximately 45% of online orders to be fulfilled in stores and drove a 19.3% increase in online sales. The introduction of a dynamic ETA feature and the seamless blending of physical and digital assets reflect operational flexibility and service innovation to improve end-to-end customer experience. Product authority was strengthened through a merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy focused on delivering product innovation, assortment and value, and by leveraging assortment planning and pricing tools to better understand customer preferences and refine product mixes by store and geography. Productivity and efficiency were advanced through continuous operational improvement in stores and supply chain, disciplined capital allocation and a stronger return on invested capital, while a multi-year program called Project Sync optimized the supply chain by reducing average lead time, cutting transportation expenses and improving inventory turns, and by creating an end-to-end solution benefiting suppliers, transportation providers, distribution centers, store associates and customers. Financial resilience was maintained through the generation of $9.8 billion of cash flow from operations, disciplined share repurchases and dividend increases, access to long-term debt capital markets and commercial paper programs supported by a $2.0 billion back-up credit facility, and the use of interest rate swap agreements to hedge fluctuations, ensuring sufficient liquidity to support operating requirements, capital expenditures, debt repayments and strategic initiatives.

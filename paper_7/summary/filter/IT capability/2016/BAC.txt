The corporation’s annual report describes an enterprise risk framework and articulated risk-appetite statement, approved by the board and the enterprise risk committee, that embeds sound risk management across strategic, credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance and reputational domains and establishes clear roles, responsibilities and controls for the three lines of defense. Business lines and asset-liability management activities use quantified measures—including risk-adjusted capital allocations, sensitivity analyses, value-at-risk and scenario-based stress testing—to identify, measure, monitor and control exposures and maintain continuity of operations under a range of expected and stressed conditions, with oversight from independent risk management and corporate audit functions. Executive management performs forward-looking capital scenario management, contingency funding planning and recovery and resolution planning, including maintenance of a global liquidity buffer of cash and high-quality liquid securities and access to contingent central bank facilities, to ensure the corporation can continue to function and preserve integrity and performance under internal or external disturbances. Governance processes promote a culture of managing risk well, requiring business continuity and adaptability through hedging programs for interest rate, foreign exchange and mortgage servicing risks, proactive credit risk mitigation, triage of deteriorating exposures by specialized asset officers, operational risk self-assessments, and reputational risk monitoring, all intended to safeguard stakeholders, sustain operational flexibility and maintain positive adjustment under nominal, extreme or exceptional pressures.

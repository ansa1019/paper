Management acknowledges that actual results could differ materially from forward‐looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties that may challenge its ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, and accordingly monitors key financial and operational metrics—such as billings, deferred revenue, cash flow provided by operating activities and free cash flow—as indicators of business continuity and organizational health. The company’s resilience strategy focuses on extending its technology leadership, growing its installed end‐customer base, expanding deployment of its security platform and services, and enhancing end‐customer satisfaction, while improving and scaling its information technology and financial infrastructure, operating and administrative systems and controls, and its capacity to manage headcount, capital, and processes efficiently. Its next‐generation security platform, which provides consistent visibility and control across network, endpoint, and cloud environments, is designed to help organizations absorb strain from targeted cyber attacks and preserve critical functioning under adverse conditions. To support sustained growth and adaptability, the company invests in research and development, thoughtfully expands its sales and marketing organizations—including its international presence and indirect fulfillment model—and increases general and administrative capabilities, recognizing that personnel costs represent a significant component of operating expenses. The board’s authorization of a share repurchase program further reflects strategic resource allocation to strengthen financial flexibility. Management believes that cash flows from operations, together with available cash, cash equivalents, and investments, will be sufficient to meet foreseeable cash needs, though future capital requirements may arise from growth initiatives such as product development, sales and marketing expansion, acquisitions, manufacturing capacity commitments, and infrastructure investments. These measures jointly demonstrate the organization’s capacity to foresee, confront, and benefit from disruptive events, adapt its resource deployment, and maintain system integrity and performance under internal and external variations and disturbances.

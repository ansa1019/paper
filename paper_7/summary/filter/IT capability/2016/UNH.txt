Management cautions that statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this report involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially, and describes how it manages its liquidity and financial position in the context of its overall business strategy by continually forecasting and managing cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet obligations while preserving flexibility.  Through its diversified family of businesses, the company leverages core competencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data; information and intelligence; and clinical care management and coordination and deploys these capabilities within strategically aligned platforms to help meet evolving market demands.  It frequently evaluates and adjusts its pricing approach in each local market, considering product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, and continues to seek a balance between growth and profitability across these dimensions.  The company maintains a prudent, market-sustainable posture for new business and for the maintenance of existing relationships, advocates for actuarially sound rates commensurate with observed medical cost trends, and intensifies medical and operating cost management through adjustments to the size and composition of its care provider networks, benefit designs, premium structures and plan offerings on a county-by-county basis.  As the health care market shifts toward incentive-based care delivery models, the company works collaboratively with clinicians to leverage data and analytics to close gaps in care and improve health outcomes, increasingly rewarding providers for quality and cost-efficiency improvements.  Management continually evaluates opportunities to expand operations through internal development, acquisitions and investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, and funds these activities through cash flows from operations, dividends from regulated subsidiaries, long-term debt issuances, commercial paper borrowings supported by bank credit facilities and available-for-sale investments, while adhering to covenants such as a defined debt-to-debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio.  In estimating medical costs payable, the company applies actuarial completion factors and medical cost per member per month trend factors—developed from historical claims, provider contracting, utilization indicators and macroeconomic variables—recognizing that actual claim payments may differ significantly.  The company tests goodwill annually (or sooner if indicators arise) by comparing estimated fair value—calculated using discounted cash flows, peer company weighted average costs of capital and projected growth rates—to carrying value, assesses intangible assets for impairment when use or market conditions change, and monitors its available-for-sale debt and equity securities for other-than-temporary impairments based on intent or requirement to sell, duration and severity of fair value declines and the issuer’s financial condition and near-term prospects.  Contractual obligations—including debt maturities, operating leases, purchase and other obligations, future policy benefits and unrecognized tax positions—are carefully monitored and managed to ensure timely resource deployment, preserve system integrity and maintain performance under internal or external variations and disturbances.

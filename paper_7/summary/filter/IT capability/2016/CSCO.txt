Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence, particularly in light of current macroeconomic uncertainties and conditions and the resulting potential for changes in future demand forecast; while the overall macro environment remains uncertain, we believe we are well positioned, and at the same time, we are aggressively investing in priority areas to drive growth over the long term regardless of the environment. We regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience, credit quality and age of the receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customerâ€™s ability to pay as well as historical and expected default frequency rates; we also regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. We monitor our investments in privately held companies for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment, and we make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required, based primarily on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies. We consider the likelihood of impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies and defer revenue associated with channel partner and end-user financing arrangements in accordance with revenue recognition criteria, thereby preserving our system integrity and performance under varying internal or external pressures.

In fiscal 2016, ADP demonstrated organizational resilience—defined as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions—by focusing on driving product innovation, enhancing distribution and service capabilities, and assisting clients with their HCM needs in the face of ever increasing regulatory complexity; upfront investments in selling and implementation of ACA compliance solutions began translating into recurring revenues and contributed to strong new business bookings despite pressure on employer services revenues from foreign currency translation and elevated losses on legacy platforms, prompting internal focus on upgrading clients to modern cloud-based solutions to preserve and improve operational performance; the announcement of a multi-year service alignment initiative, the workforce optimization effort and the issuance of $2 billion of senior notes reflect strategic approaches to resource reconfiguration and long-term shareholder return, while the high percentage of recurring revenues, healthy margins, strong client retention and low capital expenditures underscore business continuity; robust liquidity—supported by cash and marketable securities, committed credit facilities, a short-term commercial paper program and reverse repurchase agreements—and a laddered investment strategy for client funds assets, with safety of principal, liquidity and diversification objectives, illustrate risk mitigation, system integrity and operational flexibility to satisfy client obligations; disciplined capital allocation, evidenced by share repurchases, dividend increases and sustained cash flows, demonstrates future orientation and adaptive strategy to environmental disruptions, thereby enabling the firm to absorb strain and maintain performance amid internal and external disturbances.

We manage our business in four geographically defined segments to allocate resources and respond to volume, price, currency and product-mix dynamics, and we are engaged in the development and commercialization of reduced-risk products (“RRPs”) in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization, which because they do not burn tobacco produce far lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful compounds than found in cigarette smoke. Our holding-company structure relies on dividends and debt repayments from subsidiaries, while we maintain operational continuity through excise-tax collection and remittance, control our cost of sales—comprising tobacco leaf, non-tobacco raw materials, labor and manufacturing costs—and incur marketing, administration and research expenditures to develop new products. In 2015, we recorded pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs of $68 million related to severance costs for the organizational restructuring in the European Union segment, with no comparable EPS impact in 2016, and we present adjusted diluted EPS—excluding asset impairment and exit costs, discrete tax items and unusual items—to reflect core earnings, improve comparability and facilitate trend analysis. We attribute changes in diluted EPS to currency movements, interest-rate effects and segment-level operational actions such as pricing and cost management, and our guidance for 2017—excluding the impact of future acquisitions, unanticipated asset impairment and exit-cost charges, currency-exchange-rate changes and unusual events—anticipates net-revenue growth above our 4 percent to 6 percent target and a 9 percent to 12 percent increase in adjusted diluted EPS, explicitly recognizing the continuing risks described in our risk factors and underscoring our ongoing efforts to preserve or improve performance under external variations and uncertainties.

Our Managementâ€™s Discussion and Analysis highlights a range of measures and practices that support our ability to absorb strain and maintain performance under varying economic, regulatory and operational pressures. We employ a comprehensive treasury policy framework to ensure business continuity by regularly evaluating cash requirements for current operations, commitments, litigation settlements and capital expenditures, investing excess cash in high-quality securities, maintaining a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility and a $3.0 billion commercial paper program, and forecasting sources of liquidity to cover more than the next twelve months. In December 2015, we issued $16.0 billion of fixed-rate senior notes to diversify our funding mix and to fund the acquisition of Visa Europe, and we maintain a U.S. litigation escrow account to address covered litigation liabilities. We mitigate foreign exchange and interest rate risks through hedging programs, which partially offset a three-point negative impact on operating growth from currency fluctuations, and we preserve operational flexibility via defined-benefit pension funding strategies in the U.S. and U.K. Our disciplined capital allocation, including share repurchase authorizations and dividend policies, reinforces financial resilience, while ongoing investments in technology, infrastructure and integration initiatives underpin our capacity to adapt, reconfigure resources and sustain our global transaction processing network in the face of uneven economic growth and market volatility.

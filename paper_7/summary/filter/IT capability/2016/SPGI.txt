In 2016 S&P Global repositioned itself as a more focused company by exiting non-core assets and investing for growth in scalable markets, completed the divestitures of SPSE, CMA and J.D. Power and streamlined its portfolio, while acquiring Pira Energy Group and RigData to enhance energy analytic capabilities, and in the fourth quarter realigned its reportable segments—combining Market Intelligence and Platts—to reflect organizational changes. Management’s discussion highlights the company’s ability to adapt its operations and capital resources—through restructuring actions that reduced headcount, disciplined portfolio changes, significant share repurchases and dividend increases, and the redeployment of cash flows—to preserve and enhance performance under changing external conditions. These initiatives reflect the firm’s organizational resilience—its ability to absorb strain, realign resources, preserve core operations and improve functioning despite portfolio disruptions, market volatility and regulatory change. The company’s strategic framework of growth, excellence, financial discipline, operational transformation, investment in customer-driven innovation, and leadership and accountability initiatives underscores a systemic approach to risk mitigation, resource reallocation and operational flexibility designed to maintain continuity of critical functions and emerge stronger from disruptive market and regulatory environments. Additionally, S&P Global continues to evaluate and implement changes to comply with evolving regulatory frameworks—including provisions under the Dodd–Frank Act, U.S. credit rating agency reforms and EU benchmark regulation—ensuring resilience of its credit ratings, market intelligence and index businesses amid external pressures and volatility.

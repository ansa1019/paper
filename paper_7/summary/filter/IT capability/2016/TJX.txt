In fiscal 2017 we continued to generate strong cash flows, allowing us to return value through cash dividends and share repurchases and to reinvest in our business by adding new stores, remodeling existing ones and strengthening our infrastructure in support of continuing growth, including implementation of the second phase of our wage initiative for U.S. hourly store associates. We routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases denominated in other currencies, recording mark-to-market adjustments each period that are effectively offset when the hedged inventory is received and paid for. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and our credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year and we plan to fund approximately $1.2 billion of capital expenditures in fiscal 2018—about $600 million for offices and distribution centers, $350 million for store renovations and $250 million for new stores—solely through internally generated funds. Our liquidity position is supported by maintaining $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents held outside the U.S., of which $341.7 million is indefinitely reinvested, and by managing our pension obligations through both mandatory and voluntary contributions, including a $50 million voluntary contribution to our qualified pension plan in fiscal 2017. We also maintain flexibility in our long-term obligations through a combination of debt arrangements, operating lease commitments and purchase obligations and have disciplined our inventory management, achieving a 5% reduction in consolidated average per store inventories, while favorable changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities further enhanced operating cash flows.

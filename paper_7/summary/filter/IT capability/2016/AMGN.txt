Amgen’s transformation and process improvement initiatives, including a restructuring plan with pre-tax accounting charges in the range of $800 million to $900 million, are intended to establish a more agile and efficient operating model, enabling the reallocation of resources to fund innovation, product launches, clinical programs and external business development and to support long-term growth. The company has invested in next-generation biomanufacturing, including a new Singapore facility, designed to reduce the scale and cost of biologics production while retaining a reliable, high-quality, compliant supply of medicines, and continues to innovate patient- and provider-friendly delivery systems to differentiate products, reflecting organizational flexibility and innovation capabilities. Amgen’s financial management strategies—including the maintenance of over $38 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities principally held outside the United States and the use of interest rate and cross-currency swap contracts to hedge floating-rate debt and foreign currency exposures—demonstrate risk mitigation and resource management to preserve liquidity and performance under varying economic conditions. The company’s commitment to return capital to stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases, structured credit facilities and a commercial paper program, together with its policy of maintaining prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk in its investment portfolio, underpin its capacity to absorb strain and maintain operations despite market volatility and external disturbances. Ongoing collaborations and external early-stage innovation investments augment internal research efforts, reinforcing absorptive capacity, systemic perspective and strategic agility required to adapt to regulatory, competitive and environmental pressures and to preserve organizational health and performance over time.

Our cloud networking solutions deliver industry-leading performance, scalability, availability, programmability, automation and visibility, with EOS purpose-built to be fully programmable and highly modular, enabling rapid development of new features and applications and rapid integration with third-party applications to support business continuity and operational flexibility. As we have grown the functionality of EOS software, expanded our product portfolio, increased the size of our sales force and accelerated investment in infrastructure such as enterprise resource planning software and other technologies, our revenue has continued to grow rapidly, reflecting our ability to absorb strain from market pressures and preserve or improve functioning under unexpected demand variation and competitive constraints. We procure merchant silicon components from multiple vendors and work closely with third-party contract manufacturers, expanding manufacturing and operations capacity to meet evolving customer needs and mitigate supply chain disruptions. To facilitate channel coordination and productivity, we established the Arista partner program and engage systems engineers with deep technical expertise for pre-sales support, thereby preserving system integrity and service resilience across sales and support networks. Significant investments in research and development, including increased personnel costs, prototype expenses and third-party engineering support, underscore our commitment to systemic innovation and sustained performance under accelerating environmental perturbations, while expansion of sales and marketing efforts, including international expansion, trade shows, events and field demonstration programs, enhances our adaptive strategies and resource deployment capabilities in turbulent markets. Our disciplined financial and operational management, including forecasting, inventory valuation, deferred revenue recognition and liquidity planning, coupled with contractual commitments for infrastructure, leases and non-cancelable purchase orders, reflects a strategic focus on risk mitigation, resource reconfiguration and recovery mechanisms to maintain continuity and resilience amid competitive and legal challenges. We believe that our ability to invest for long-term growth, manage customer concentration and timing variability, defend against litigation, and anticipate and address operational and market constraints demonstrates our organizational resilience, defined as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, and positions us to sustain our integrity and performance while under internal or external variations and disturbances.

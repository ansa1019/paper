Management emphasizes that we operate in an environment characterized by both increasing complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures, and that a significant component of our strategy is to enhance program execution, improve the quality and predictability of product and service delivery, and place security capabilities quickly into customers’ hands at affordable prices. Recognizing that our customers are resource constrained, we are endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner with a focus on adjacent markets close to our core capabilities, while growing international sales and continuing affordability initiatives. We invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements and in our people to ensure we have the technical skills necessary to succeed without limiting our ability to return free cash flow to investors. We continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio through independent research and development, targeted acquisitions and divestitures, and internal realignment, selectively expanding or complementing our current offerings to meet customers’ current and future needs and reallocating resources away from businesses that no longer align with our strategy. We negotiate performance-based payment terms, proactively manage funding constraints and potential cash­flow timing issues under continuing resolutions, and rely on a backlog largely funded from prior fiscal years to mitigate the impact of procurement delays. Our international business growth relies on strengthening relationships through partnerships, joint technology efforts and industrial cooperation agreements to support evolving customer requirements across multiple regions. We execute concurrent development, production and sustainment contracts on complex programs to test systems, shorten fielding cycles and achieve cost savings, and we monitor and adjust product and service costs, pricing structures and portfolio composition through ongoing portfolio-shaping activities. Strategic acquisitions, such as Sikorsky, and consolidation of ventures, such as AWE, reflect our approach to reconstituting and reconfiguring operational capabilities to preserve or improve functioning amidst adversity, while severance and realignment actions demonstrate our commitment to organizational agility and operational continuity in a resource-constrained and unpredictable environment.

In 2016, amidst uneven global growth and shifting trade patterns, we continued to adjust our air capacity and cost structure across our transportation network to better match prevailing volume levels and contain costs, while our broad portfolio of offerings and the flexibilities inherent in our network helped us adapt to changing e-commerce and omni-channel retail trends and stabilize time-in-transit through newly expanded operating facilities. We deployed targeted technology improvements—including facility automation projects and the accelerated rollout of our On-Road Integrated Optimization and Navigation system (“Orion”)—to increase network capacity and improve operational efficiency, flexibility and reliability, and redirected SurePost volume to optimize delivery density and lower consumer-shipment costs. Across all segments, we undertook strategic initiatives to improve yield management, enhance flexibility and capacity, contain expenses and rebalance purchased transportation in response to fuel price volatility and external disturbances, thereby mitigating risk, preserving system integrity and maintaining performance under pressure. Our ongoing productivity enhancements—through network adjustments, aviation block-hour management and disciplined revenue and rate actions—illustrate a systemic perspective and resource reconfiguration approach designed to sustain continuity, absorb strain and position the organization for resilience amid turbulent markets.

In response to dynamic macroeconomic and market perturbations—including reduced GDP in commodity-producing economies, political unrest, foreign exchange volatility and commodity price fluctuations—the company maintains a disciplined approach to investing so as not to sacrifice the long-term health of its businesses, underpinned by a strategic productivity and cost savings plan that has incurred incremental restructuring charges to streamline management decision making, manufacturing processes and other work processes, with the goal of absorbing strain, preserving operational continuity and redirecting cost savings into product and packaging improvements, consumer insights-driven innovation, increased sales coverage and R&D programs. The company drives productivity improvement across cost of goods sold, marketing and non-manufacturing overhead; implements outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and workforce optimization; and dynamically manages foreign exchange and interest rate exposures through forward contracts, currency swaps and derivative hedging, while leveraging its global cash management strategy, strong credit ratings, undrawn bank credit facilities and substantial operating cash flow generation to fund dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions, capital spending and tax obligations, thus reinforcing resilience in resource allocation, maintaining system integrity and performance under pressure, supporting business continuity and ensuring adaptability and strategic agility in the face of adversity. A focused portfolio reshaping program has divested non-strategic brands to concentrate resources on ten category-based businesses with leading market positions and consumer-meaningful technologies, enhancing organizational coherence and competitive advantage. In addition, rigorous impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets against fair value estimates, prudent income tax planning and ongoing evaluation of uncertain tax positions further support the organization’s capacity to foresee, confront and benefit from sudden disruptive change while sustaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

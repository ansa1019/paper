In our Form 10-K discussion, we describe a range of plans, investments, processes and risk-management practices that collectively support the maintenance of our operational integrity and performance under varying conditions.  We continually allocate financial and human resources—expanding data center capacity, network infrastructure and office facilities, scaling headcount in engineering, technical, marketing, sales, and general and administrative functions, and investing in safety, security and long-term technology initiatives such as artificial intelligence and augmented and virtual reality—to preserve and enhance our functionality as user engagement and demand evolve.  We employ forward-looking statements reflecting our plans, estimates and beliefs, and we rigorously evaluate assumptions and critical accounting estimates on an ongoing basis to mitigate the risk of errors and ensure business continuity.  Our liquidity strategy—comprising cash and marketable securities, a $2 billion unsecured credit facility, multi-currency notional cash pooling, and projected cash generation from operations—underpins our ability to absorb shocks such as foreign-exchange fluctuations, tax law changes and legal contingencies, for which we record provisions when losses are probable and measurable.  We monitor operational costs, including data-center and infrastructure expenses, content acquisition, and transaction fees, and we manage contractual obligations and contingent liabilities to maintain sufficient resources to respond to environmental variations and external pressures.  Share repurchases, capital expenditures and tax-planning measures are executed with a view toward preserving financial flexibility and strategic agility, enabling us to adapt to disruptive changes, sustain performance under pressure and emerge stronger from adverse or exceptional conditions.

Bank of America’s resilience is grounded in a comprehensive risk framework, approved annually by the enterprise risk committee and the board, that integrates strategic, capital and financial planning with day-to-day operations to ensure positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The corporation maintains “global liquidity sources,” consisting of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities, to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs even in stressed markets, and uses liquidity stress analysis and contingency funding plans—including capital contingency and recovery plans with monitoring, escalation, asset-sale and de-risking options—to preserve operational continuity. A centralized funding and liquidity management approach diversifies funding across deposits, secured and unsecured borrowings, and trading-related financing, while intercompany arrangements support a single-point-of-entry recovery strategy. Periodic capital scenario management and stress forecasting, along with an annual internal capital adequacy assessment process, test balance-sheet, earnings and capital sensitivities under adverse scenarios to inform capital actions under CCAR. Governance is reinforced by a three-lines-of-defense model—front-line units, independent risk management and corporate audit—supported by detailed policies, stress tests and risk appetite limits covering strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks, thereby enabling the bank to adapt, allocate resources effectively and maintain performance and integrity in the face of internal or external variations.

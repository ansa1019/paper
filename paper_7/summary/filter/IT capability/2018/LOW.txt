During fiscal 2018 the company executed a comprehensive strategic reassessment to build a sustainable foundation for long-term success, establishing a new leadership team, realigning decision-making and execution, rationalizing store inventory to remove clutter and lower-performing SKUs while investing in top-selling items in job-lot quantities for its pro customer, and exiting non-core activities including Orchard Supply Hardware, select renovation services, smart-home operations and under-performing domestic and international stores, actions which gave rise to $1.1 billion of long-lived asset impairment, accelerated depreciation, severance and lease obligation charges and a $952 million goodwill impairment for its Canadian reporting units.  In pursuit of organizational resilience as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, the company sharpened its mission of delivering the right home improvement products with the best service and value by focusing on four interrelated strategic initiatives—driving merchandising excellence through improved productivity, localization, reset processes and digital experiences; transforming its supply chain via enhanced fulfillment, delivery capabilities and operational excellence; delivering operational efficiency through simplified store operations and improved in-stock execution; and intensifying customer engagement with competitive pricing, consistent service levels and differentiated experiences—while maintaining access to liquidity through cash flows from operations, commercial paper and revolving credit facilities, deploying capital expenditures to strategic initiatives and returning excess cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.  The company’s risk mitigation and adaptability practices include merchandise reserves for obsolescence and shrinkage based on anticipated sales trends and historical experience, self-insured accruals for workers’ compensation, auto and product liability claims, rigorous reviews of individual store asset recoverability using discounted future cash flows and market approaches, recognition of store-closure lease obligations on a probability-weighted present value basis, and forward-looking capital allocation and non-GAAP measures such as return on invested capital to position the organization for continued performance maintenance amid environmental perturbations, external pressures and resource constraints.

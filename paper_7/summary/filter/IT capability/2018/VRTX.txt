Throughout 2018, Vertex demonstrated its capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning under challenging conditions by closely monitoring and reconfiguring its discovery, research, clinical trial and nonclinical programs, frequently reassessing and shifting priorities in light of new scientific, business and regulatory insights with the objective of balancing risk and potential, and effecting abrupt changes in focus as additional information became available. The Company invested substantial financial, technical and human resources in scientific innovation and in the diversification of its research programs across multiple serious diseases, collaborating with biopharmaceutical and academic partners, government laboratories and foundations to access external knowledge and capabilities needed to execute its strategy, and thereby mitigated the inherent risks of drug development. Vertex maintained a comprehensive corporate compliance program to identify, prevent and mitigate risk through formal policies, systems and the promotion of a culture of compliance, and dedicated significant management and other resources to secure and maintain appropriate levels of reimbursement from third-party payors in the United States and ex-U.S. markets, engaging in strategic negotiations and long-term access agreements to ensure operational continuity and adapt to external pressures on pricing and access. Regulatory uncertainty and potential delays in approvals prompted the Company to maintain operational flexibility by balancing its pipeline investments, making upfront and milestone payments under collaboration agreements, and, when warranted, deconsolidating certain variable-interest entities and recording impairment charges against intangible assets. Financial resilience was reinforced by a diversified liquidity profile—comprising cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $3.2 billion, an available $500 million revolving credit facility, strategic equity positions despite volatility, and an ongoing share repurchase program—while the release of its deferred-tax asset valuation allowance in the fourth quarter, driven by sustained profitability and future performance expectations, further strengthened its balance sheet and underscored its ability to maintain integrity and performance under internal and external variations.

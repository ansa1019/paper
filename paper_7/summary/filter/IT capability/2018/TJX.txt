The Company’s disclosures reflect a comprehensive approach to preserving positive adjustment under challenging conditions through proactive risk mitigation, operational flexibility and resource reconfiguration. For example, Management acknowledges that “the company’s results are subject to risks and uncertainties,” and routinely “enters into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates,” recording mark-to-market adjustments that are offset when inventory is received. To bolster supply-chain resilience, the Company “continues to invest in existing and open new distribution centers” and, in response to Brexit, “evaluated a range of possible outcomes, sought to identify areas of concern and implemented strategies to mitigate them,” having “developed a plan to realign our European division’s supply chain” and established “resources and systems to support this plan.” After hurricanes “significantly impacted” certain stores in Puerto Rico, those locations were excluded from comp sales until they again met criteria, demonstrating an adaptive response to disruptive events. In reaction to the 2017 Tax Act, the Company reinvested tax benefits through “discretionary bonus to eligible non-bonus plan associates” and “incremental contribution to the Company’s defined contribution retirement plans,” thereby allocating financial and emotional resources to strengthen organizational health. Liquidity and financial resilience are maintained by holding significant “cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and our credit facilities” to meet operating needs, annuitizing pension obligations to reduce long-term liabilities and calibrating stock repurchase and dividend programs based on assessments of excess cash flow, market conditions and business prospects.

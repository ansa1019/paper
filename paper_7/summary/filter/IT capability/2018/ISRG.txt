We take a holistic “systems” approach to offer intelligent technology and systems designed to work together to make minimally invasive surgery more available and applicable, decreasing variability in surgery by offering dependable, consistent functionality and user experiences. A measured rollout of the da Vinci SP surgical system, placing systems in the hands of experienced users first while we optimize training pathways and our supply chain, exemplifies our strategic resource allocation, supply-chain adaptation, and operational flexibility under challenging conditions. By entering into sales-type and operating lease arrangements, we provide customers with flexibility in how they acquire surgical systems—offering usage-based payment models and buyout rights at lease end—thereby expanding procedure availability, mitigating financial risks, and leveraging our balance sheet to preserve functioning despite external uncertainties. We believe this leasing program has been effective and well-received and plan to expand it based on customer demand, supporting business continuity through recurrent service contracts and predictable revenue streams. Our focus on developing, marketing, and training for procedures where da Vinci can deliver relative patient value and economic benefit reflects a future orientation, strategic foresight, and inter-organizational collaboration that enhance adaptability to evolving reimbursement environments, seasonal budgeting cycles, and competitive pressures. The adaptability of our distribution model—direct operations in core markets and distributor partnerships elsewhere—and the establishment of a joint venture to research, develop, manufacture, and distribute robotic‐assisted catheter-based medical devices in China demonstrate our resource reconfiguration and collaborative networks to absorb strain and maintain performance under internal and external disturbances. Moreover, our stringent field-action processes—preparing and submitting regulatory notifications, notifying customers in their national languages, and arranging product corrections or replacements—illustrate our risk mitigation, crisis management, and organizational resilience strategies that preserve integrity and performance in the face of regulatory, operational, and market pressures.

We periodically assess and adjust the estimated useful lives of equipment in our DRAM wafer fabrication facilities to extend depreciation periods in response to industry trends and technology-node transitions, reducing depreciation expense by approximately $100 million per quarter and preserving operational flexibility. We continue to jointly develop NAND and 3D XPoint technologies with Intel through multigenerational development agreements, and in fiscal 2018 reconfigured our collaboration model to independently optimize subsequent generations, reflecting our capacity to reconfigure relationships and investments to support future product roadmaps. Our primary sources of liquidity—cash generated from operations, available financing under an undrawn $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, and a diversified portfolio of high-credit-quality money market funds and fixed-income securities—are continuously evaluated to ensure sufficient funding for capital expenditures, working capital and debt obligations, thereby mitigating credit and market-volatility risk. We estimate capital expenditures in 2019 of $10.5 billion, net of partner contributions, focused on technology transitions and product enablement to sustain growth, achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality. We manage limitations on cash and investments held by MMJ and IMFT entities—prohibited from dividends, loans or advances without court or partner consent—and indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings, acknowledging constraints on resource redeployment. During fiscal 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was driven by higher net sales and working-capital adjustments; investing activities were primarily expenditures for property, plant and equipment; and financing activities centered on debt reduction, an accelerated share repurchase agreement totaling $1.65 billion and a $1.36 billion public equity offering, demonstrating our ability to reconfigure capital structure under varying market conditions. Under our critical accounting estimates we continuously evaluate contingencies, goodwill and intangible-asset impairment indicators, property, plant and equipment recoverability, inventory net-realizable-value adjustments and the realizability of deferred tax assets, employing significant judgments to maintain system integrity and performance under internal and external variations.

In fiscal 2018, the company generated $13.0 billion of operating cash flow, which, together with cash on hand, was used to fund $10.0 billion of share repurchases, $4.7 billion of dividends, $2.4 billion of capital expenditures and repayments of $1.2 billion of senior notes and $220 million of short-term borrowings, reflecting strategic resource allocation to support operational continuity and shareholder returns; management believes that its cash position, access to long-term debt markets, $3.0 billion of commercial paper capacity with back-up credit facilities and internally generated cash flow, together with alternative financing sources, should be sufficient to meet operating requirements and capital expenditure programs through the next several fiscal years. To finance real estate assets, including stores, distribution centers and support centers, the company employs capital and operating leases, and it periodically issues senior notes and utilizes derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations, thereby mitigating financial risks. Inventories are valued under the retail inventory method using cost-to-retail ratios adjusted for markups, markdowns and shrink to approximate lower of cost or market, and long-lived assets are evaluated quarterly for indicators of impairment by comparing undiscounted future cash flows, projected under various economic and competitive scenarios, to carrying values and measuring fair value where required, preserving asset integrity. Self-insurance programs for general liability, workersâ€™ compensation, employee medical and automobile claims establish reserves based on historical data and actuarial estimates that are reviewed regularly to ensure adequate coverage. These financial policies, capital allocation decisions and risk management processes are designed to enable the organization to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under internal and external variations and disturbances, maintain system integrity and performance, and adapt effectively to environmental perturbations and financial contingencies.

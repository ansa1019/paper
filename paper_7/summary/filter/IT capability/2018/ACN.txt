Although the company’s disclosures do not explicitly reference “organizational resilience,” its description of monitoring significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty across markets and its stated practice of seeking to manage costs in order to respond to changing conditions reflect an intention to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The firm proactively plans and manages the size and composition of its workforce, adjusting hiring levels, attrition management, compensation and pricing mix to keep its supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand, thereby reconfiguring and deploying resources to preserve or improve functioning despite external pressures. Through continuous monitoring of operating expenses, implementation of cost-management actions and utilization of currency protection provisions and hedging programs, the company absorbs currency fluctuations and foreign-exchange volatility to maintain business continuity. Its use of the percentage-of-completion method for revenue recognition and regular reassessment of contract estimates, including recognizing loss provisions when losses become probable, and the deferral and systematic amortization of transition costs under outsourcing arrangements demonstrate risk assessment and adaptability in operational processes. Furthermore, the maintenance of cash reserves, access to committed credit facilities and diversified service lines across consulting, outsourcing and geographic regions constitute systemic mechanisms to sustain liquidity and absorb strain. Together, these strategic and operational practices align with the scholarly notion of resilience as the maintenance of positive adjustment under adversity and the ability to absorb disturbances while preserving or improving firm performance.

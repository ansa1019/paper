In 2018 we reorganized our reporting structure, beginning to report Market Intelligence and Platts as separate segments consistent with changes to our organizational structure and how our Chief Executive Officer evaluates performance, reflecting our capacity to reconfigure trajectories and adapt our operations in response to internal and external pressures. During the three years ended December 31, 2018, we reconstituted our portfolio through strategic acquisitions—including Kensho Technologies Inc., Pira Energy Group and RigData—and divestitures of non-core businesses such as J.D. Power, SPSE, CMA, QuanHouse and equity research, thereby redeploying resources to strengthen analytical capabilities, data visualization, artificial intelligence and machine-learning platforms and preserve business continuity. We manage four reportable segments—Ratings, Market Intelligence, Platts and Indices—allocating economic resources based on each segment’s contribution to operating profit and adjusting product offerings to evolving customer needs, which underpins our operational flexibility and resilience in volatile markets. Market Intelligence expanded annualized contract values in its desktop, global risk services and data-management solutions, integrated recent acquisitions to extend its analytical reach, and developed an enterprise-wide data strategy to harness new data sources and technologies. Platts laid the groundwork for enhancing its commercial model and simplifying customer-facing and operating platforms to improve the quality and continuity of market data and price assessments, while Indices diversified its revenue mix through higher average assets under management for exchange-traded funds, mutual funds and exchange-traded derivatives, thereby reinforcing our system resilience and financial stability. Across our global operations we are transforming technology infrastructure to support growth, improve cost efficiency, mitigate cyber and regulatory risk, adopt core management systems and processes to reduce complexity, and further enhance our risk, internal-control and compliance culture. We are investing in people—promoting an inclusive performance-driven culture, internal mobility, talent retention and diversity—to sustain organizational health, emotional and intellectual resources, and adaptive capability. Our strong capital position—consisting of cash on hand, cash flows from operations and a committed revolving credit facility—affords us sufficient liquidity to meet operating and strategic needs and maintain performance under pressure. In 2019 we will continue to strengthen analytical excellence, pursue disciplined acquisitions and partnerships, extend core businesses with innovative products, streamline the digital user experience and drive commercial transformation, all in service of preserving and enhancing our ability to absorb strain, preserve functioning and emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

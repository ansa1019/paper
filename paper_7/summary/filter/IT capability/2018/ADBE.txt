In Managementâ€™s Discussion and Analysis, the Company reports completing its acquisitions of Marketo for $4.74 billion, Magento for $1.64 billion and TubeMogul for $560.8 million and describes the ongoing integration of these acquired businesses into its digital experience and digital media segments, reflecting deliberate resource reconfiguration and operational continuity under evolving conditions. The Company states that, in preparing its consolidated financial statements, it makes assumptions, judgments and estimates based on historical experience and other factors, evaluates these on a regular basis and discusses them with the Audit Committee to address potential internal or external variations and disturbances. Its critical accounting policies for business combinations require allocating purchase price to tangible and intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations at estimated fair values using cost build-up approaches, which underscores its capacity to absorb unanticipated events and preserve functional performance. The Company emphasizes its long-term plans for two strategic growth areas, supported by significant investments in research and development and in sales and marketing to maintain competitive advantage, adaptability and performance maintenance, measured chiefly by annualized recurring revenue. Further, its disclosures of deferred and unbilled deferred revenue backlog, the maintenance of a $1 billion revolving credit facility and a $2.25 billion term loan, and its structured $2.05 billion stock repurchase program illustrate proactive liquidity management and resource allocation designed to support stability, absorb strain and emerge stronger from challenging situations.

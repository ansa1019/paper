Management acknowledges that forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including dynamic macroeconomic factors such as reduced GDP, political unrest, trade policy changes and commodity price fluctuations, any of which could impair sales, operating margins and financial results. The company addresses these pressures through a disciplined capital allocation framework and a multi-year productivity and cost savings program designed to streamline supply chain, manufacturing, marketing and overhead processes; these initiatives generate savings that are reinvested in product and packaging innovations, marketing effectiveness and enhanced accountability across organizational roles. A centralized approach to risk mitigation and liquidity management leverages diversified funding sources—including substantial operating cash flows, committed bank facilities and capital market issuances—and strong credit ratings, while operational hedging and derivative instruments manage currency, interest rate and commodity exposures. Strategic portfolio focus on structurally attractive categories and leading global market positions supports adaptation to fragmented and highly competitive environments. Restructuring activities and enrollment optimizations further enable the organization to absorb internal and external pressures, reconfigure resource deployment and maintain the integrity of performance under challenging conditions, preserving long-term organizational health and continuity.

In 2018, we generated net sales of $9.823 billion, an 8.6 percent increase that included 8.0 percent operational growth and 60 basis points from foreign currency fluctuations, reflecting our ability to absorb variation and preserve performance under changing external conditions; operational growth was underpinned by the strategic acquisitions of Symetis, NxThera, Claret and Augmenix, each bringing new revenue streams and demonstrating our capacity to reconfigure resources and capabilities in response to disruptive events. Effective January 1, 2018, we realigned our organizational structure and reportable segments to focus on active implantable devices without altering our reporting units, exemplifying systematic adaptation and operational flexibility. We continued to invest in end-to-end business process streamlining, automation, global shared services and robotic process utilization as part of targeted initiatives to reduce SG&A expenses while maintaining or improving functioning under constraints. In November 2018, our board approved a global restructuring plan anticipated to deliver $100 million to $150 million in annual pre-tax expense reductions by the end of 2022, with a substantial portion of savings reinvested in strategic growth initiatives, illustrating our transformative response strategies and future orientation. We manage liquidity and ensure business continuity through $146 million of cash and cash equivalents, diversified short-term investments, a $2.75 billion commercial paper program, a £3.315 billion bridge facility and delayed draw term loans, all designed to mitigate financial risk and uphold system integrity under stress. We maintain rigorous risk assessment and accrual processes for litigation and product liability, recognizing potential impacts on operating results, and in 2018 resolved long-standing IRS transfer pricing disputes through stipulations of settled issues, recording net tax benefits of $340 million and demonstrating resilience in confronting regulatory adversity. Our critical accounting policies—encompassing revenue recognition for deferred service obligations, inventory provisions for excess and obsolete stock, impairment testing of intangible assets and goodwill and uncertain tax position reserves—support the maintenance of performance and integrity of our financial reporting systems amid market turbulence and environmental perturbations.

Through our MD&A we describe a number of organizational actions and resource deployments that illustrate our capacity to absorb strain and preserve performance under adversity.  For example, through our un-carrier strategy, we’ve disrupted the wireless industry by listening to customers and providing added value and an exceptional experience, including signature initiatives that changed the industry, and we believe our un-carrier strategy, along with ongoing network improvements, has been successful in attracting and retaining customers as evidenced by continued branded customer growth and improved churn.  In April 2018, we entered into the business combination agreement to merge with Sprint, which is expected to enable us to rapidly launch a nationwide 5G network, accelerate innovation and increase competition in the U.S. wireless, video and broadband industries.  We also acquired Layer3 TV to advance our video strategy, representing an opportunity to acquire complementary services and reconfigure our offerings.  To support business continuity and future growth, we invested $5.5 billion in property and equipment in 2018 and expect to invest $5.4 to $6.1 billion in 2019, including the deployment of low-band 600 MHz spectrum and groundwork for 5G, demonstrating proactive resource allocation, operational flexibility and strategic foresight.  During 2018, we recognized $61 million of costs related to hurricanes—including $36 million in incremental costs to maintain services primarily in Puerto Rico—and received $307 million of insurance reimbursements, of which $5 million was accrued as an offset to costs incurred, reflecting our ability to respond to extreme events and mitigate disruptions.  We maintain liquidity and financial resilience through arrangements to sell certain EIP and service receivables on a revolving basis, vendor financing and capital lease facilities, and through active debt management, including refinancing and credit facilities.  Finally, we continuously monitor the integrity of our long-lived assets via annual goodwill and spectrum license impairment assessments—applying both qualitative evaluations and a greenfield income approach—to ensure our system of resources and capabilities remains robust under changing conditions.

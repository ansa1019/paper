We believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to changes such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private‐label items, and through our online offerings to maintain positive adjustment under challenging economic conditions. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we have demonstrated over the long term. Our philosophy to provide members with quality goods and services at competitive prices and to maintain our perception of “pricing authority” has led us to invest in merchandise pricing, which at times includes reducing prices to drive sales or holding prices steady despite cost increases, thereby preserving member loyalty and sustained functioning. We have also achieved sales growth by opening new warehouses, despite lower initial operating profitability and cannibalization, with these negative aspects declining over time as our total operations adapt and flourish. Our e-commerce growth, both domestically and internationally, further demonstrates our capacity for service innovation and resource flexibility. Our membership format is designed to reinforce member loyalty, provide continuing fee revenue, and materially influence profitability, with high renewal rates reflecting organizational health. We recognize that our financial performance depends heavily on our ability to control costs, including partially uncontrollable expenses such as health-care and utility expenses, and that maintaining employee wages and benefits above industry averages supports longer-term objectives of reducing turnover and enhancing satisfaction under resource constraints. Our operating model remains generally consistent across geographic segments, with foreign markets exhibiting higher square footage growth, lower wages and benefits costs, and less direct competition, reflecting our capacity to reconfigure resource deployment in varying conditions. We routinely monitor and adapt to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and gasoline prices, which can materially impact net sales growth, gross margins, and SG&A expenses, and we leverage increased sales to mitigate operating costs as a percentage of net sales. Management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future, with cash and short-term investments financed by robust warehouse operations and membership fees and with bank credit facilities undrawn but available, supporting business continuity and operational flexibility. We plan capital expenditures for new and relocated warehouses, information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, and initial warehouse operations, funded by cash from operations and existing investments, subject to review and change, demonstrating forward-looking resource planning. Financing activities, including dividend payments, stock repurchases pursuant to SEC Rule 10b5-1 plans, and senior note issuances and repayments, are managed to sustain corporate liquidity and strategic agility. Our use of operating and capital leases and contractual purchase obligations, most containing clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty, is managed to preserve system integrity and flexibility. We employ critical accounting estimates in self-insurance liabilities—using historical claims experience, demographic and severity factors, and actuarial assumptions—to estimate reserves for catastrophic events, and in income tax provisions—using judgment, estimates, and probabilistic assessments of uncertain positions—to maintain accurate and reliable financial statements. This comprehensive approach to pricing, cost control, capital allocation, operational scaling, risk management, and financial planning reflects our organizational resilience through the maintenance of performance and integrity amid external pressures and variations.

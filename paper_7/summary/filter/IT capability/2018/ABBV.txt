AbbVie’s management has emphasized a strategy of ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term by advancing and investing in its pipeline, diversifying revenue streams and driving late-stage assets to market while maintaining financial flexibility and operational continuity, including expanded liquidity through operating cash flows of $13.4 billion in 2018, a new five-year $3.0 billion revolving credit facility, the issuance of senior notes and term loans, and open-market and accelerated share repurchases under authorizations up to $15 billion, all of which support the company’s ability to respond to environmental disruptions and reconfigure resources under challenging conditions. The company’s continued leverage from revenue growth, reduction of royalty expenses, productivity initiatives in supply chain, and ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure and administrative costs reflect a systemic perspective on maintaining integrity and performance under internal and external variations. AbbVie monitors economic conditions, customer creditworthiness and government regulations worldwide, establishes allowances for probable credit losses, and may employ factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, thereby preserving business continuity and resource deployment across its distribution channels. In research and development, AbbVie allocates increased funding to support all stages of its more than 60-compound pipeline—over 30 in mid- and late-stage—while entering into collaborations that include contingent milestone payments, and assesses the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities by modeling probabilities of success, discount rates and future sales, with sensitivity to changes in these inputs. The company records loss contingency provisions for probable litigation outcomes at management’s best estimate or, in the absence of a reliable estimate, at the minimum of a probable range, and regularly adjusts these reserves as further information becomes available. AbbVie’s critical accounting policies—including variable consideration for rebates, chargebacks, cash discounts and product returns recorded as reductions of revenue, and the annual impairment assessments of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles and in-process R&D—demonstrate its adaptive strategies for potential forecast errors, regulatory developments, patent expirations and competitive pressures such as biosimilar erosion. Through these measures—encompassing risk assessment, resource allocation, operational flexibility, financial resilience and proactive contingency planning—AbbVie seeks to absorb strain and preserve or improve its functioning despite adversity, consistent with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

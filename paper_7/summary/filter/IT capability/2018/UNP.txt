Our management discussion describes a multi-faceted approach to safety and network reliability—utilizing technology, risk assessment, training and employee engagement, quality control, targeted capital investments and our continuous improvement culture (“Up Way”), as well as programs such as Total Safety Culture and Courage to Care—to reduce risk, eliminate incidents, preserve positive adjustment under challenging conditions, and maintain operational performance across our integrated rail network; we implemented Unified Plan 2020 and G55+0 initiatives to increase service reliability, reduce variability in network operations, optimize resource utilization (including a 10 percent reduction in car inventory and a 625-locomotive fleet downsizing) while maintaining similar volume levels, and reconfigure train operations and terminal rationalization to align management structures and decision-making processes; our 2019 capital plan of approximately $3.2 billion directs 75–80 percent toward renewing and improving existing infrastructure, expanding capacity, and modernizing locomotives and freight cars to support business continuity, operational flexibility and long-term growth; we maintain multiple liquidity sources—including operating cash flow, a $650 million receivables securitization facility, a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, commercial paper and public debt issuances—to meet foreseeable cash requirements, manage volatility in fuel and financing costs, and mitigate the impact of external pressures on our ability to access capital markets; we conduct sensitivity analyses of interest rate and tax changes, record actuarial liabilities for personal injury and environmental remediation, reassess asset lives through depreciation studies, and continue exploring technology and efficiency programs—such as fuel-consumption reduction training and rail defect detection—to strengthen system integrity, adapt to disruptions like severe weather events, and preserve performance under pressure.

Blackstone describes its global business as one “organized into four segments” that operates “as one globally integrated business, with investments in North America, Europe, Asia and Latin America” and “seeks to establish a differentiated view and capitalizes on our scale and proprietary information advantages to invest with conviction and generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our investors over the long-term,” while its real estate group “addresses any property or business issues through active asset management” and its insurer-focused platform “delivers bespoke, capital efficient investments and diversified portfolios of Blackstone products across asset classes tailored to their needs and risk profile.” Under “Business environment” the firm acknowledges that “our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions” and that in late 2018 “volatility spiked” as investor sentiment turned negative amid signs of slowing growth, “trade disputes” and monetary tightening, before markets “rebounded” in early 2019, and it cautions that “global trade tensions and geopolitical instability pose additional risks.” In its segment analyses, Blackstone observes that “ongoing volatility could contribute to a more challenging environment for realizations going forward,” that decelerating growth in sectors such as retail “may contribute to a more challenging environment for our portfolio companies,” and that rising interest rates, a stronger dollar or higher inflation “would also potentially negatively impact segment distributable earnings” in real estate and private equity while “capital deployment in our credit segment may be challenged” by concurrent economic weakness and that hedge fund solutions “may be negatively impacted by a prolonged weak equity market environment” driven by macro-geopolitical factors. Throughout, the firm emphasizes its use of “traditional financial measures and key operating metrics” to assess the productivity of its investments, make “operating decisions, allocate resources and determine the compensation of employees,” and to calibrate risk assessment, resource allocation and strategic initiatives so as to preserve or improve performance under fluctuating market conditions.

The company describes its strategic growth investments as targeted spending to enhance commercial capabilities—including geographic sales expansion, e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure and focused research projects—to adapt to evolving customer needs and sustain performance under market pressures, and it cites productivity improvements through its practical process improvement business system, global sourcing initiatives, facility consolidations, headcount reductions and low-cost region manufacturing to preserve or improve functioning amid inflationary cost increases.  Management maintains significant liquidity and contingency funding capacity, comprising $2.10 billion of cash and cash equivalents, a $2.50 billion unsecured revolving credit facility—partly undrawn in an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds if commercial paper markets become unavailable—and the expectation that existing cash, future operating cash flow and borrowing capacity will suffice to meet cash requirements for at least the next 24 months, thereby supporting operational continuity and resilience.  Critical accounting judgments and estimates are based on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other reasonable assumptions, and the company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or upon the occurrence of unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes, competitive activities, loss of key personnel or governmental actions, recognizing that economic downturns or credit market volatility could require impairment charges.  The company records accruals for legal, environmental, product liability and other contingencies based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, actuarial estimates and legal counsel opinions to mitigate risks, and it implements ongoing tax planning initiatives, refinancings and restructuring actions—including debt repurchases, new borrowings and acquisition financing—to optimize its capital structure, deploy resources effectively and position itself to absorb strain and emerge stronger from challenging or exceptional conditions.

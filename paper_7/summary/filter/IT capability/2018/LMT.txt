Lockheed Martin reports that it operates in an environment characterized by both complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures, and has made program execution, delivery quality and predictability, rapid deployment of security capability, affordability initiatives and investment in new technologies and workforce skills central to its strategy to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Recognizing that its customers are resource constrained, the company endeavors to extend its portfolio in adjacent markets, grow international sales and pursue independent research and development, acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities to expand or complement its core capabilities, reconfigure its portfolio toward future needs and divest businesses that no longer meet strategic objectives. Throughout its long-term, cost-reimbursable and fixed-price contracts with government and commercial customers, Lockheed Martin identifies and monitors technical, schedule and cost risks, revises estimates of total costs to complete contracts, adjusts profit booking rates to reflect risk retirements or adverse developments, and records loss reserves when losses are probable, thereby preserving functioning and organizational health under unexpected situations. Strategic reviews and segment realignments have resulted in severance and restructuring actions designed to improve efficiency, operational flexibility and alignment of the cost structure with changing economic conditions, with the expectation that a portion of these charges will be recoverable through future contract pricing. The company also employs risk mitigation mechanisms against market risks—such as foreign currency hedges, interest-rate swaps and active counterparty exposure management—and maintains liquidity through commercial paper, a revolving credit facility and access to capital markets to ensure business continuity in the face of funding uncertainties. In managing defined benefit pension plans, Lockheed Martin has frozen benefits for most participants, made substantial contributions and entered into pension risk transfer transactions to stabilize future funding requirements and reduce the volatility of benefit obligations. Environmental remediation liabilities are reviewed each quarter, accrued when probable and reasonably estimable, and generally allocated to general and administrative costs recoverable under government contracts. Collectively, these actions reflect a multifaceted approach to adaptability, resource allocation, operational continuity and performance maintenance under internal and external pressures.

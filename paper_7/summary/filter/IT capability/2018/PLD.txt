During the year ended December 31, 2018, operating fundamentals remained strong with occupancy of 97.5 percent, historic lows in vacancies, strong customer and investor demand, leases signed with record long terms and a strong balance sheet, even amidst market volatility caused by current trade and tariff disputes and uncertainty with regard to the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union, and management continued to be prudent in running the business. The Company extended its debt maturities to 76 months and lowered its weighted-average effective interest rate to 2.7 percent through the issuance of senior notes in euros, dollars and yen, reflecting strategic resource reconfiguration and risk mitigation, while generating net proceeds of $2.8 billion and realizing net gains of $841 million from contributions of properties to unconsolidated co-investment ventures and dispositions of non-strategic assets—completing a program that yielded approximately $14 billion in proceeds and refocused the O&M operating portfolio on the highest-quality properties in the best markets. The segmentation of NOI into real estate operations and strategic capital, the allocation of property management and leasing costs based on square footage, and the retention of more than 70 percent of customers illustrate maintenance of performance under external pressures. Capital expenditures of $100 million capitalized to development, leasing and operating improvements, equity commitments of $3.1 billion in co-investment ventures and $3.4 billion of available borrowing capacity, along with disciplined funding for development completions, acquisitions and scheduled debt service, further demonstrate the organization’s capacity to absorb strain, preserve functioning and adapt resources to sustain continuity and emerge stronger from disruptive change.

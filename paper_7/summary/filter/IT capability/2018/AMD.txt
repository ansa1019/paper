Our 2018 financial results demonstrate the success of our strong product roadmap execution, with customers continuing to adopt new high-performance products that accounted for over 65 percent of annual revenue, and our operating results showed the ability to manage seasonal variations in PC and semi-custom SoC demand. In response to evolving accounting standards, we adopted the new revenue recognition model effective Q1 2018, recognizing revenue upon shipment to distributors and establishing provisions for rights of return and price protection on unsold inventory. We maintain business continuity through $1.16 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 29, 2018 and a secured revolving line of credit providing up to $500 million of committed borrowing capacity, of which $70 million was drawn and $175 million remained available, enabling dynamic working‐capital funding and brief intra‐period borrowings repaid within 90 days. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence based on projected sales outlook, writing off obsolete stock and adjusting carrying values to the lower of cost or net realizable value. We perform annual goodwill impairment analyses, first assessing qualitative factors such as market conditions and financial performance and then, if necessary, conducting quantitative tests using projected cash flows, discount rates and future economic assumptions. During 2018 we finalized our computations under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, recorded provisional impacts in 2017 and elected the period cost method for the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) provisions, reflecting our capacity to adjust promptly to regulatory change. Net cash provided by operating activities of $34 million was driven by higher cash collections from revenue growth and disciplined management of labor costs and payables, while investing activities used $163 million for property and equipment purchases, supplemented by sales of receivables, and financing activities generated $69 million of proceeds from stock issuances under incentive plans and deployed $40 million to repurchase senior notes. We have secured long-term operational capacity through non-cancellable operating leases—including new ten-year leases in Shanghai and Santa Clara—and by amending our wafer supply agreement to establish minimum purchase obligations, underscoring our strategic commitments to maintain system integrity, resource availability and organizational performance under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

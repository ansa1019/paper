In our management’s discussion, we emphasize forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties and undertake proactive risk assessment and mitigation strategies to preserve organizational resilience. In fiscal 2018, we implemented a cost plan designed to align our cost structure to long-term margin targets, executing targeted actions across our businesses to reduce annual costs by $1.0 billion and recording $687 million of restructuring and restructuring-related charges, with anticipated full realization of savings in fiscal 2019. We continue to invest significant resources toward advancements in 4G and 5G technologies, RF front-end electronics, converged Snapdragon chipsets and adjacent industry segments such as automotive, Internet of Things and networking to foster adaptability, maintain competitive advantage and support business continuity amid rapid technological change and environmental turbulence. Our strategic responses to regulatory and legal challenges—defending investigations by the European Commission and Taiwan Fair Trade Commission through appeals and financial guarantees, and enforcing royalty payments in ongoing disputes with Apple and its contract manufacturers—demonstrate our crisis management, resource allocation and recovery practices under adverse conditions. We have adjusted segment reporting and research and development cost allocations to reflect evolving development trajectories, and continue to pursue strategic investments and acquisitions to reconfigure our portfolio of capabilities. To manage supply chain concentration, seasonal demand fluctuations and geopolitical uncertainties, we actively manage working capital, maintain revolving credit and commercial paper programs, and optimize liquidity through a disciplined capital return program that has deployed $22.6 billion in share repurchases and dividends while preserving financial flexibility. We adapted to U.S. tax reform by recognizing a one-time repatriation charge and remeasuring deferred tax assets and liabilities, and are evaluating elections to reduce exposure to global intangible low-taxed income and base-erosion anti-abuse taxes. These measures collectively support our ability to absorb strain, reconstitute operations and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions, consistent with the definition of organizational resilience.

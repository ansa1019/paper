Management continuously monitors global macroeconomic conditions and evaluates opportunities to improve operational effectiveness, align expenses with revenues and maintain business continuity, and, as a result of these assessments, has undertaken various restructuring actions including the consolidation of wafer and test facility operations, planned closures of certain fabrication and test sites and transfers of production and testing to internal facilities, external foundries and outsourced partners, which are expected to yield approximately $60 million of annual savings once fully implemented. The company maintains significant liquidity—$816.6 million of cash and cash equivalents held with high-credit-quality counterparties in highly liquid instruments, diversified to minimize credit risk—and believes that existing cash, projected operating cash flow and available long-term financing will fund operations, capital expenditures and strategic initiatives for at least the next twelve months, while a $1 billion undrawn revolving credit facility and $6.3 billion of senior unsecured notes and term loans provide additional resource flexibility. Working capital management efforts include balancing manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels, deferring revenue and related cost of sales on shipments to distributors until resale to end customers and diligently managing accounts receivable to support cash generation. The company’s disciplined capital allocation encompasses continued investment in research and development—hundreds of projects underway critical to product leadership—capital expenditures of approximately 4 percent of projected revenue and a dividend policy tied to financial performance, outlook and liquidity. Strategic adoption of new accounting standards, ongoing evaluation of critical accounting judgments and compliance with debt covenants further underpin resilience by ensuring the integrity of financial reporting, the preservation of credit standing and adaptability to changes in external reporting requirements.

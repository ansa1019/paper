During fiscal 2018, the Company demonstrated its ability to absorb strain and preserve performance under challenging conditions by maintaining a strong focus on operational excellence and financial discipline while repositioning for future growth, sustaining core activities across more than 35 countries and realigning its portfolio through internal research and development, product acquisitions, in-licensing initiatives and a suite of strategic collaborations aimed at accelerating innovation and securing access to new technologies.  The introduction of authorized generic versions of its hepatitis C medicines via a separate subsidiary was undertaken to mitigate competitive pressures and preserve healthcare system continuity without materially disrupting its business, while inventory reserve adjustments for excess raw materials reflected proactive risk assessment and resource reconfiguration in response to shifting market dynamics.  The Company also hedged foreign currency exposure to dampen the impact of exchange rate volatility, certified additional cell therapy centers to ensure uninterrupted patient access and continually reviewed its clinical trial pipeline to reallocate R&D resources based on scientific data, probability of success, market potential and available capital, thereby reinforcing organizational health and operational flexibility.  Leadership succession planning and a disciplined capital return program, including targeted stock repurchases and dividend increases, further underscored its strategic agility and resilience strategies, while robust liquidity from operating cash flows, revolving credit facilities and timely debt management provided the financial resources necessary to maintain business continuity, respond to external pressures and emerge stronger from an increasingly turbulent and uncertain environment.

We operate in a highly competitive environment, facing rapidly changing consumer preferences, a shifting retail landscape, continued macroeconomic and political volatility and evolving regulatory requirements, and we have adopted an approach called “winning with purpose” to help make our company faster, stronger and better at meeting the needs of customers, consumers, partners and communities while caring for our planet and inspiring our associates. Our strategies are designed to enhance long-term sustainable growth by strengthening and broadening our portfolio to locally meet consumer needs, implementing productivity initiatives to improve operational efficiency and competitive advantage, transforming our core capabilities through technology and talent investment to drive cost savings, and leading with purpose to establish a more sustainable food system, minimize environmental impact, protect human rights and secure supply. We continuously monitor economic, operating and political conditions—such as civil unrest, natural disasters, debt and currency fluctuations—in the more than 200 countries and territories where we operate, and identify actions to mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results, including advocating alternative measures with respect to taxes and regulations and building global capabilities to distribute products through emerging trade channels. We leverage an integrated risk management framework—overseen by our board of directors, the pepsico risk committee and division- and country-specific risk committees and supported by our risk management office, corporate audit department and compliance and ethics function—to identify, assess, prioritize, manage, monitor and communicate strategic, financial, operating, compliance, safety, reputational and other risks, and to report progress on risk mitigation efforts. We deploy joint ventures, divestitures and refranchisings to reconfigure our geographic footprint and secure business continuity, as exemplified by our refranchising transactions in Thailand, Jordan and central Europe. Multi-year productivity plans, including the 2014 plan extended through 2019 and a new plan announced in 2019, focus on harmonizing and automating processes, re-engineering go-to-market systems, simplifying our organization and optimizing our manufacturing and supply chain footprint; these initiatives involve severance and other employee-related costs, asset impairments and implementation costs and are expected to generate significant cost savings and cash expenditures over several years. We manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate exposures through productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and a robust hedging program that uses derivatives—including swaps and futures—to hedge anticipated commodity, currency and interest-rate risks, while applying hedge accounting where appropriate to align hedge gains and losses with the underlying exposures. Our distribution network, comprising company-owned and independent bottlers, contract manufacturers and third parties, supports the delivery, merchandising and replacement of damaged or out-of-date products to maintain integrity and performance under internal or external pressures. Through disciplined capital allocation—balancing share repurchases, dividend payments, debt financing, productivity investments and acquisitions such as sodastream—we preserve financial flexibility and resilience in turbulent markets, enabling positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

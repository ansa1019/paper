In June 2017, we announced the consumer direct offense, a new company alignment designed to allow Nike to better serve the consumer personally at scale by leveraging digital, accelerating innovation and product creation, moving even closer to the consumer through key cities and deepening one-to-one connections; as a result of this organizational realignment, management focused on a triple double strategy to double the impact of innovation, increase speed to market and grow direct connections with consumers, investing in capabilities—particularly digital capabilities, consumer experiences and product and brand marketing—to fuel our next phase of long-term growth and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Our fiscal 2018 results demonstrated the power of our portfolio to generate revenue growth while investing in infrastructure to support future growth—including corporate facilities, expanding digital capabilities and new Nike Direct stores—and by effectively managing liquidity and capital resources (including cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, a $2 billion commercial paper program and a $2 billion committed credit facility), we believe we have sufficient capacity to meet domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future. To preserve system integrity and performance under internal or external variations, we centrally manage global foreign exchange risk on a portfolio basis, employ derivative hedging to mitigate currency volatility, maintain inventory reserves and allowance for uncollectible receivables, utilize non-GAAP measures to evaluate performance, and apply rigorous critical accounting policies—such as recoverability assessments of long-lived assets, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and contingent liability provisions for endorsement contracts—thereby enhancing our operational flexibility, risk mitigation and organizational health across all operating segments and enabling positive adjustment, adaptation and resilience in turbulent markets.

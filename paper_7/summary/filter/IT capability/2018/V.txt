Visa’s organizational resilience is underpinned by its advanced transaction processing network, VisaNet, which enables fast, secure and reliable authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions in over 200 countries and territories, while continued investments to support business growth and select pricing modifications demonstrate resource allocation to preserve and improve functioning under nominal or adverse conditions. A comprehensive treasury policy framework, including diversified sources of liquidity—cash on hand, available-for-sale investment securities, a $3 billion commercial paper program, a $4 billion revolving credit facility and a universal shelf registration—aids in providing adequate liquidity for operational expenditures, liquidity contingency scenarios, planned capital investments, litigation settlements, share repurchases and dividend payments. Risk mitigation is further achieved through a hedging program that partially offsets foreign currency volatility, global credit settlement risk policies that require collateral for clients failing to meet credit standards, indemnification arrangements for settlement shortfalls and a U.S. litigation escrow account established under the retrospective responsibility plan to cover monetary liabilities from U.S. covered litigation without reliance on unrestricted cash. The company routinely evaluates cash requirements and forecasts future funding needs, maintains policies limiting credit exposure, monitors credit ratings and market conditions, and reassesses its investment portfolio to respond to external pressures and environmental turbulence. Strategic initiatives such as client incentives are systematically accrued and, where appropriate, capitalized and amortized based on forecasts of payment volume and contract performance to drive acceptance and volume growth while ensuring transparent financial reporting. Provisioning for uncertain tax positions, engagement in acquisitions and share repurchase programs, debt issuances with no financial covenants, and contractual commitments for lease and purchase obligations are managed to safeguard system integrity, maintain performance under pressure and enable adaptive responses to disruptive events and evolving regulatory and economic landscapes, thereby allowing Visa to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

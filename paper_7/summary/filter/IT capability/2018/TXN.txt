The Company’s MD&A identifies core elements of its business model that support maintenance of performance under varying conditions, including a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology whereby the strategic decision to directly control our manufacturing helps ensure a consistent supply of products for our customers and allows us to invest in technology that differentiates the features of our products; a broad portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing semiconductors whose breadth enables meeting more customer needs and the opportunity to sell more products and generate more revenue per customer system; the broadest reach of market channels through web presence and a global sales force that give us unique access to about 100,000 customers; and the diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions which deliver high terminal value, reduce dependency on any single product, customer, technology or market, and generate revenue for decades. In response to the late 2018 semiconductor market downturn and weakened demand, management committed to disciplined operating plans and expenses while focusing on long-term investments to strengthen our competitive advantages, a stance underpinned by cash flow from operations of $7.19 billion and free cash flow of $6.06 billion which “provide insight into our liquidity, our cash-generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders.” The Company further affirms that total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $4.23 billion, combined with an undrawn $2 billion revolving credit facility, represent the financial resources and operating plans necessary “to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months.” Inventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods using statistical allowances based on historical disposals and net realizable value assessments, and tax provisions include reserves for uncertain tax liabilities and judgments about deferred tax asset recoverability, reflecting proactive risk assessment and resource allocation practices designed to absorb strain and preserve functioning under internal or external variations and disturbances.

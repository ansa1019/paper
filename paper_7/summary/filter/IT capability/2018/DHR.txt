Danaher characterizes itself as a diversified, global business whose operations are influenced by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic and political factors and states that its geographic and industry diversity and the breadth of its products, software and services help limit the impact of any one industry or country economy on its consolidated operating results. Management reports that it monitors general economic trends along with key competitors and customers to gauge relative performance and outlook, continuously assesses rapid technological developments, expansion and evolution of opportunities in high-growth geographies and market segments, global labor trends, consolidation of competitors and regulatory pressures, and plans for potential impacts such as the U.K.’s decision to exit the EU. The company asserts that its long-term growth and profitability will depend on its ability to expand in high-growth markets, identify, consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions, develop innovative and differentiated new products and services, expand and improve the effectiveness of its sales force, continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality, and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated global environment. To these ends, Danaher is making significant investments, both organically and through acquisitions, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources in order to be responsive to customer needs worldwide and improve the efficiency and continuity of its operations. The company further reports that its broad-based business activities help reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area may have on its operating profit as a whole, that the aggregation of trade accounts receivable, inventories and payables contributed positively to operating cash flows in 2018, and that it manages exposure to market risks—such as interest rate, foreign currency and commodity price fluctuations—through its normal operating and financing activities, occasional use of derivative instruments and regular credit evaluations and collateral practices to mitigate credit risk. The MD&A also highlights ongoing productivity improvement initiatives, resource reconfiguration associated with acquisitions and discontinuations of product lines, and planned corporate separations and spin-offs, each of which supports the company’s ability to realign resources, maintain or improve functioning under internal and external variations and disturbances, and adapt strategically to evolving business environments.

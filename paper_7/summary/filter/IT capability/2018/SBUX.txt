In fiscal 2018 Starbucks undertook comprehensive restructuring and streamlining efforts to accelerate growth in high-return businesses and remove non-core, slow-growth activities, including the acquisition of its East China joint venture, the conversion of its Singapore, Taiwan and Brazil operations to licensed models, the closure of certain company-operated and Teavana stores, the sale of the Tazo brand and the licensing of its CPG and foodservice businesses to Nestlé; concurrent with these actions it realigned its organizational and operating segment structures in support of its newly established Global Coffee Alliance, restated prior period financial information and reclassified certain costs to better align expenses with corresponding revenue-generating activities. Following the ownership change in East China, Starbucks began consolidating 100 percent of the joint venture’s revenues and expenses, reflecting disciplined investments in digital platforms, technology infrastructure and innovations, higher salaries and benefits, restructuring and impairment costs associated with store closures, goodwill impairment charges in its Switzerland retail reporting unit and EMEA restructuring costs including severance and asset impairments—measures indicative of resource reconfiguration, operational flexibility and adaptation under challenging conditions. Starbucks also manages commodity price risk for green coffee and dairy through fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts and financial derivatives, mitigates foreign currency volatility via hedges on anticipated intercompany royalties, inventory purchases and borrowings, and addresses interest rate risk through interest rate swap agreements, thereby preserving business continuity and systemic performance. The Company maintains liquidity and capital resources through active cash and investment management, available unsecured revolving credit facilities, a commercial paper program and multiple senior note issuances to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. Capital expenditures of approximately $2.0 billion supported 1,997 net new stores in fiscal 2018, with plans for roughly 2,100 net new stores in fiscal 2019, all aligned with strategic priorities to accelerate growth in core markets, expand global reach and sharpen focus on core value drivers—demonstrating the organization’s capacity to absorb strain, preserve functioning and sustain performance amid external pressures and environmental perturbations.

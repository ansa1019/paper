The Form 10-K discusses the objectives and effectiveness of our business continuity plan, information security program, risk management and liquidity policies, and describes our resolution plan and resolution strategy, including the design and effectiveness of our resolution capital and liquidity models and our triggers and alerts framework, thereby reinforcing our ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. We have established a global business resilience committee responsible for oversight of business resilience initiatives, promoting increased levels of security and resilience, and reviewing certain operating risks related to business resilience. We maintain a contingency funding plan to provide a framework for analyzing and responding to a liquidity crisis situation or periods of market stress that outlines potential risk factors, key reports and metrics reviewed on an ongoing basis to assist in assessing the severity of, and managing through, a liquidity crisis and/or market dislocation, and assigns mitigants and action items to individuals responsible for execution. We conduct various scenario analyses—including our comprehensive capital analysis and review and Dodd-Frank Act stress tests—as well as resolution and recovery planning, covering short-term and long-term horizons with macroeconomic and firm-specific assumptions, to inform balance-sheet, funding and capital strategies. In anticipation of the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union, our plan to manage a hard Brexit scenario involves transition of certain activities to new and/or different legal entities; working with clients and counterparties to redocument transactions so they face one of our E.U. legal entities; changes to our infrastructure; obtaining and developing new real estate; and, in some cases, moving our people to offices in the E.U., all of which demonstrate our commitment to adaptability and operational continuity.

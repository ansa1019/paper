NEE uses derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity, as well as interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with outstanding and expected future debt issuances and borrowings, with changes in fair value reflected through regulatory assets for FPL or consolidated income for its non-rate-regulated operations. Its energy marketing and trading activities are governed by established credit policies, counterparty credit limits, master netting agreements and collateral requirements designed to mitigate credit exposures and ensure operational continuity amidst market volatility. NEE and its subsidiaries require funds to support and grow their businesses; these funds are primarily provided by cash flows from operations, short- and long-term borrowings, issuances of equity securities, proceeds from differential membership investors and sales of assets to NEP or third parties, and are supported by revolving credit facilities, commercial paper programs, shelf registration capacity and corporate guarantees to maintain financial flexibility and strong investment grade ratings. Under the Florida Public Service Commission’s rate agreements, FPL utilized reserve amortization to offset nearly all of the December 2017 Hurricane Irma storm restoration costs and plans to partially restore the reserve through tax savings during the term of the 2016 rate agreement, thereby reconfiguring resources to maintain service integrity under extreme conditions. The strategic allocation of over $13 billion in capital expenditures toward plant-in-service investments, renewable wind and solar capacity additions, transmission and distribution enhancements, nuclear fuel purchases and decommissioning funding—supported by restricted special-use funds for nuclear decommissioning and storm reserves—reflects a systemic perspective on resource deployment and service innovation to adapt to environmental perturbations and evolving customer needs. Guarantee arrangements, including letters of credit, surety bonds and indemnifications totaling over $1 billion for project financing and trading activities, underpin execution of strategic initiatives by substituting collateral posting with corporate or subsidiary guarantees, while replacement capital covenants for junior subordinated debentures ensure that redemptions or defeasances are aligned with the issuance of equity-like instruments. Periodic stress testing through value-at-risk modeling of commodity positions, fair-value sensitivity analyses for interest rate and equity price risks, assessments of recoverability for long-lived assets and actuarial valuations of pension obligations enable proactive risk mitigation and preservation of performance maintenance, demonstrating NEE’s capacity to absorb strain and preserve functionality in accordance with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

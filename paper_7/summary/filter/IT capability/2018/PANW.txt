Our management’s discussion acknowledges forward-looking statements “subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ materially,” underscoring the need for positive adjustment under challenging conditions. We describe our security operating platform that “empowers enterprises, service providers, and government entities to secure their organizations by safely enabling applications and data running in their networks, on their endpoints, and in the cloud, and by preventing breaches that stem from targeted cyberattacks,” providing “consistent security across the network, endpoint, and cloud” to enable transformative initiatives while “maintaining the visibility and control needed to protect their valued data and critical control systems.” We believe our platform “offers superior performance compared to legacy approaches and reduces the total cost of ownership for organizations by simplifying their security operations and infrastructure and eliminating the need for multiple, stand-alone hardware and software security products,” and our subscriptions deliver “real-time access to the latest antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, and modern malware prevention capabilities,” with ongoing updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and repairs to preserve operational continuity. We emphasize continued “investment in innovation” and “timely development of new features and products as essential to meeting the needs of our end-customers and improving our competitive position,” and note that our growth and success are dependent upon our ability to extend “technology leadership,” grow our end-customer base, expand deployment of our platform and support offerings, and focus on end-customer satisfaction. To manage future growth effectively, we must “continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner.” We monitor key measures—including billings, “cash flow provided by operating activities,” and “free cash flow”—to evaluate growth trends, operational efficiencies, and the health and visibility of our business, and we believe “our cash flow from operations with existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future,” while acknowledging that future capital requirements will depend on our growth rate, the timing and extent of development and infrastructure spending, the adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings, and our ability to access additional financing. Our supply chain planning relies on demand forecasts “based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions,” with accruals for manufacturing purchase commitments in excess of forecasted demand, and we employ a “two-tiered, indirect fulfillment model” and a field sales force working closely with channel partners to maintain operational flexibility. We recognize revenue from multiple-element arrangements by allocating selling prices based on “vendor-specific objective evidence,” “third-party evidence,” or our “best estimate of selling price,” thereby reflecting the fair value of deliverables over their contractual periods. Our accounting for income taxes uses the asset and liability method with a “full valuation allowance for domestic and certain foreign deferred tax assets” and a two-step process for uncertain tax positions, including provisional amounts recognized in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Upon exiting leased facilities, we assess the “fair value of our remaining obligation” and record a cease-use loss based on estimated sublease rentals and discount rates. We identify and accrue for loss contingencies when “it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated,” and we review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment using qualitative and quantitative tests. Collectively, these disclosures describe our organizational capabilities to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning despite adversity, adapt resource deployment, and maintain system integrity and performance under nominal, extreme, or exceptional variations and disturbances.

The Company’s risk and insurance services segment includes risk management activities—risk advice, risk transfer and risk control and mitigation solutions—as well as insurance and reinsurance broking and services designed to absorb strain and preserve functioning under market fluctuations. During 2018, Marsh initiated a simplification initiative to reduce management layers and standardize structures across regions and businesses to more closely align with its segmentation strategy, creating increased efficiencies and additional capacity for reinvestment in people and technology. Mercer implemented a business restructure to establish a unified wealth business reflecting a unified client strategy for its former retirement and investment businesses, better aligning its global investment management capabilities and improving resource allocation. To hedge the economic risks of currency and interest rate fluctuations associated with the pending Jardine Lloyd Thompson acquisition, the Company entered into a deal-contingent foreign exchange contract and treasury lock derivatives and secured a £5.2 billion bridge loan and a $1.8 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility, thereby ensuring financing continuity and supporting strategic capital deployment under varying market conditions. The Company also revised funding strategies for its defined benefit pension plans—including plan modifications in Canada, the U.K. and the U.S., negotiated deficit recovery contributions and updated asset allocation targets—to maintain plan integrity and performance under discount rate and demographic changes. Repatriation of non-U.S. earnings, subject to regulatory and Tax Cuts and Jobs Act considerations, along with share repurchases, senior note issuances and contingent consideration payments, further illustrate the Company’s systemic approach to risk mitigation, resource reconfiguration and operational adaptation aimed at maintaining organizational integrity and performance amid external pressures and environmental perturbations.

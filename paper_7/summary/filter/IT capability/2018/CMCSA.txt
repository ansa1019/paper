Management’s discussion and analysis is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and related notes to enhance the understanding of our operations and our present business environment. We have continued to invest in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity, in line extensions for the expansion of our business services, and in the ongoing development, deployment and support of our X1 platform, cloud DVR technology and wireless gateways to enhance service flexibility and resilience in response to evolving customer demands and competitive pressures. Capital expenditures increased in our cable communications segment and in our NBCUniversal theme parks segment, reflecting continued investment in network capacity and new attractions, and we expect future capital commitments will depend on factors such as acquisitions, competition, technological change, regulatory developments, service deployment timing and required capacity. We maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper programs to meet short-term liquidity requirements, and we believe we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements—including fixed charges—through cash flows from operating activities, existing cash and investments, available borrowings and our ability to obtain future external financing, having met our debt covenant requirements by a significant margin as of December 31, 2018. In order to reduce indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition of Sky, which was financed through unsecured term loans, senior unsecured fixed and floating rate notes and cash on hand, we plan to pause our common stock repurchase program in 2019 and may from time to time make optional repayments on our debt obligations, including repurchases or exchanges of public notes, depending on market conditions. We continue to apply the individual production forecast method to capitalize and amortize film and television costs, updating our ultimate revenue estimates based on theatrical performance and market trends, and we assess these capitalized costs for impairment when triggering events occur. Likewise, we assess the carrying value of our indefinite-lived cable franchise rights annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances warrant, using discounted cash flow models, market multiples and other indicators, and we could record impairment charges in the future if long-term market conditions, operating results or regulatory changes prevent recovery of their carrying values. We reconcile adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Comcast Corporation in order to assess consolidated and segment operating performance, allocate resources and capital across our reportable segments, and support comparisons with industry peers, thereby reinforcing our strategic flexibility, resource allocation discipline and ability to preserve performance under varying business environments.

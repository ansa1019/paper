Nike’s management highlights a multidimensional approach to sustaining performance under internal and external disruptions by driving operational excellence through investments in supply-chain automation, waste reduction, enhanced customization and speed-to-market, and by expanding higher-margin direct-to-consumer channels and digital capabilities to buffer against port congestion, currency headwinds and evolving market conditions. The company’s centrally managed foreign exchange risk program, including natural offset strategies, hedging of product purchase and monetary exposures and a factory currency adjustment mechanism, is designed to mitigate translation and transaction risks and preserve financial stability in volatile currency environments. Continuous allocation of resources to infrastructure improvements, working capital efficiency, consumer engagement and performance-based compensation, combined with disciplined capital deployment through share repurchases, dividends and access to committed credit facilities, underpins Nike’s capacity to maintain profitability and liquidity across geopolitical and economic perturbations. Fiscal 2015 results—record revenues and margin expansion despite significant foreign currency headwinds and west coast port delays—reflect the company’s adaptability, operational flexibility and strategic foresight, while adherence to investment grade financial policies, covenant compliance and prudent tax and cash repatriation strategies reinforce its resilience and ability to preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions.

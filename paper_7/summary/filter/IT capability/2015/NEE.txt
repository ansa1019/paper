NextEra Energy and its subsidiaries require funds to support and grow their businesses, primarily through a combination of cash flow from operations, borrowings or issuances of short- and long-term debt and equity, resulting in total net available liquidity of $7.7 billion at December 31, 2015, of which $3.1 billion was FPL’s portion. NEE, FPL and NEECH rely on access to credit and capital markets as significant sources of liquidity, and the inability to maintain current credit ratings could affect their ability to raise capital and require additional collateral, demonstrating proactive financial risk mitigation and business continuity planning. Capital initiatives such as FPL’s modernization of the Port Everglades power plant to a high-efficiency natural gas unit, replacement of aging gas turbines, reinforcement of transmission and distribution infrastructure and development of solar projects, along with NEER’s planned additions of wind and solar capacity and investment in natural gas pipeline infrastructure, reflect strategic adaptation and investment in operational flexibility. Derivative instruments, including swaps, options, futures and forwards, are used to manage commodity price risk inherent in fuel and electricity transactions, while NEER’s derivatives optimize generation and infrastructure value and facilitate trading activities to capitalize on market conditions, supported by a value-at-risk model to measure market risk. FPL maintains the capacity to absorb up to $119 million in future prudently incurred storm restoration costs without immediate regulatory recovery, and subsidiaries issue guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds, totaling billions, to facilitate project development and trading activities, with credit risk managed through policies, netting agreements and collateral requirements. Asset retirement obligations and special-use funds for nuclear decommissioning and storm-damage restoration are funded over asset lives based on regulatory-filed studies, ensuring the organization’s ability to absorb strain, preserve integrity and maintain performance under internal and external disturbances.

Management discloses that, in addition to its historical consolidated financial information, its forward-looking statements reflect plans, estimates and beliefs and caution that factors, including those in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors,” could materially affect its results, illustrating an ongoing risk assessment and mitigation framework. The Company has adopted non-GAAP measures, including constant currency revenue—“to enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business”—thereby supporting business continuity and adaptability under changing foreign exchange and market conditions. In 2015, the Company “continued to make progress on our three main revenue growth priorities: (i) continuing to capitalize on the shift to mobile, (ii) growing the number of marketers using our ad products, and (iii) making our ads more relevant and effective through continued adoption of newer ad formats and tools for marketers.” In addition, “we invested, and will continue to invest, across three priorities: (i) our core products and services to better serve our existing communities and businesses, (ii) our next generation of services, such as Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, and (iii) our long-term innovation efforts, such as connectivity efforts, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence research,” reflecting strategic resource allocation, service innovation and future orientation to preserve and improve functioning despite dynamic technological and competitive pressures. Management anticipates that cost of revenue will increase in 2016 as it expands data center capacity and technical infrastructure “to support user growth, increased user engagement, and the delivery of new products and services,” and plans to continue hiring software engineers and other technical employees to support its research and development initiatives, as well as increasing staffing for marketing, sales, and general administrative functions to support overall company growth, thereby bolstering its operational flexibility and absorptive capacity. The Company states that its available funds—which include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and an undrawn $6.5 billion revolving credit facility—together with cash flow from operations, “will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future,” underscoring its financial resilience and continuity planning. It further notes that it records provisions for loss contingencies when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, reviews these provisions at least quarterly to reflect updated information, and acknowledges that adverse legal outcomes “could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows,” thereby highlighting its systemic risk management and capacity to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

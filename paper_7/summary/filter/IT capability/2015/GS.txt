Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis describes a comprehensive capital management policy and contingency funding plan designed to ensure the firm’s ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including the pre-funding of estimated cash and collateral needs and the identification of drivers of a capital deficiency along with mitigants and potential actions. We detail our business continuity and information security programs, our liquidity and funding policies, and the maintenance of global core liquid assets to meet a broad range of potential outflows in severely stressed environments. We explain our rigorous asset-liability management process, which includes quarterly balance sheet planning, diversification of funding sources, explicit secured and unsecured funding tenors, and daily monitoring of key liquidity metrics. We perform regular liquidity coverage and intraday liquidity stress tests, as well as longer-term, multi-factor stress scenarios, to quantify potential loan losses, counterparty defaults, changes in market values and collateral needs under hypothetical credit and market shocks. Our capital planning and stress testing processes incorporate both regulatory scenarios prescribed by CCAR and DFAST and internally developed severely adverse scenarios, ensuring that we hold sufficient capital and liquidity to operate through business-as-usual and stressed periods. We also maintain resolution and recovery plans, in accordance with regulatory requirements, to outline strategies for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress. Oversight of these resilience strategies is provided by our firmwide risk committee, the firmwide finance committee, the firmwide client and business standards committee and other governance forums, which review risk limits, capital and liquidity projections, model validations and operational risk controls to preserve firm performance, adaptability and integrity through volatility, external pressures and unexpected disruptions.

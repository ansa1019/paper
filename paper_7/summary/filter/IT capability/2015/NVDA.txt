The company leverages its vertical integration to “bring together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, systems and services to create unique value for the markets we serve,” transforming into a specialized platform across gaming, professional visualization, datacenter and automotive markets to mitigate external disruptions and sustain competitive advantage. Management’s discussion describes routine “periodic evaluation” and revision of estimates based on “historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,” including scenario analyses for revenue recognition, inventory provisions for “excess or obsolete inventory” arising from “sudden and significant decreases in demand,” and periodic impairment reviews of marketable securities and goodwill using Monte Carlo simulations and discounted cash flow models. In response to underperforming operations, the company incurred $131 million of restructuring and other charges to wind down its icera modem operations, recording employee severance and related costs, asset impairments and facilities exit costs while reallocating resources toward strategic growth areas such as deep learning, self-driving cars and gaming. Its inventory management policy requires commitments based on forecasts of future customer demand that account for third-party manufacturers’ lead times and constraints and adjusts to changes in market conditions and competitive pricing. A disciplined investment policy mandates the purchase of “high grade investment securities,” diversification of asset types and portfolio duration limits, with an impairment charge recorded when a decline in fair value is “significantly below cost basis and judged to be other-than-temporary.” Capital allocation balances shareholder returns—$800 million returned through share repurchases and dividends in fiscal 2016, with a plan to return approximately $1.00 billion in fiscal 2017—with continued investment in property, equipment and an off-balance-sheet build-to-suit headquarters lease, while management believes “existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating, acquisition, share repurchase, cash dividend and capital requirements” under variable market conditions. Furthermore, the company records provisions for legal and tax contingencies when “a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss,” ensuring preservation of resources and continued performance amid internal and external pressures.

Bank of America describes a formal enterprise risk framework, approved by the board and the enterprise risk committee, which establishes clear roles, responsibilities and accountability for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling key risks and incorporates a risk appetite statement aligned with the corporation’s strategic, capital and financial operating plans in order to support the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under stress. This framework includes detailed contingency planning routines—capital contingency planning, liquidity contingency funding plans, recovery planning and enterprise resiliency—that provide monitoring, escalation routines and response plans designed to protect operational continuity in stressed environments. Comprehensive scenario analysis and stress testing under both baseline and severe market conditions are used to assess potential impacts on the balance sheet, earnings, capital and liquidity, while capital, liquidity and funding strategies maintain excess liquidity sources in the form of cash and high‐quality unencumbered securities, diversified deposit funding and secured and unsecured wholesale borrowings. Asset and liability management activities project net interest income under alternative interest rate and foreign currency shock scenarios, and hedging instruments such as interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forwards are employed to mitigate exposures. Governance of operational and compliance risks is guided by formal policies and controls and a three-lines-of-defense model—front line units, independent risk management and corporate audit—supplemented by risk and control self-assessments, key risk indicators, and operational loss and scenario analyses to identify and address process failures, system deficiencies, external events and regulatory pressures. A combination of insurance, credit derivative protection, portfolio diversification and strategic resource allocation is used to mitigate both quantifiable and emerging risks, and regular reviews by senior management and the management risk committee ensure that capital, liquidity and operational resources remain aligned with the corporation’s resilience objectives and its capacity to recover from adversity.

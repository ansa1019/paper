In 2015, we continued to execute the transformation and process improvement initiatives announced in 2014, reducing our geographic footprint and workforce by approximately 3,500 to 4,000 positions and reallocating resources to fund innovative pipeline and growth opportunities, thereby demonstrating our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve core operations under challenging conditions; these efforts, together with disciplined liquidity and capital resource management—through operating cash flows, marketable securities, commercial paper and a revolving credit facility—support business continuity and strategic flexibility for product launches, later-stage clinical programs and potential acquisitions. To mitigate risks from foreign currency fluctuations and interest rate variability, we employ hedging strategies including cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps that offset exposures inherent in our international and fixed-rate debt, while our diversified financing arrangements and strong cash generation enable us to respond effectively to external pressures such as biosimilar competition following patent expirations, pricing and reimbursement constraints imposed by third-party payers, and increasing regulatory scrutiny. By maintaining targeted R&D investments despite uncertainty, collaborating with innovators, returning capital through dividends and share repurchases, and actively managing working capital and inventory levels, we maintain our integrity and performance in the face of market disruptions and evolving healthcare landscapes, reflecting a systemic perspective and dynamic capabilities aligned with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

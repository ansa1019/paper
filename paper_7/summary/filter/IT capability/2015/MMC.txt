The company’s MD&A highlights its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under internal and external pressures—“achieving growth despite significant foreign exchange headwinds, caused by the strengthened U.S. dollar”—through systematic resource reconfiguration and risk mitigation. Its risk and insurance services segment “includes risk management activities (risk advice, risk transfer and risk control and mitigation solutions)” and insurance and reinsurance broking services, reflecting capabilities in business continuity and risk assessment. The company “isolates the impacts of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, acquisitions and dispositions” to measure underlying revenue changes, thereby maintaining system integrity amid volatility. Marsh and Guy Carpenter manage fiduciary funds “held in a fiduciary capacity for others” under segregated rules, illustrating controlled resource allocation. The risk segment “completed thirteen acquisitions during 2015,” while the consulting segment “completed eight acquisitions,” adjusting service offerings and fee structures to respond to “global economic conditions, competition [and] currency translation.” Corporate initiatives such as “strengthening cyber security protections” and “corporate transformation efforts, primarily within the HR and finance functions” further demonstrate strategic agility. As a holding company, liquidity management relies on “dividends and other payments from operating subsidiaries,” “repatriation of foreign earnings,” a $1.5 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility with coverage and leverage covenants, and generation of “$1.9 billion of cash from operations” to ensure operational flexibility. Plan amendments—including termination of the post-65 retiree medical reimbursement plan, closure of defined benefit pension plans in select jurisdictions, re-measurement of plan assets and extension of amortization periods—resulted in a “net credit of approximately $125 million,” elimination of ERISA funding requirements for 2016 and an expected reduction in net periodic benefit costs of “approximately $165 million,” illustrating proactive reconfiguration of long-term liabilities to sustain organizational health.

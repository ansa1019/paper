In our 2015 Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we disclose that we faced a challenging business environment driven by global macro-economic conditions, particularly volatility in the Greater China region, competitive pressures and reduced OEM demand ahead of the launch of Microsoft Windows® 10, which collectively strained our demand and revenue. In response to these external pressures and to maintain positive adjustment under adversity, we introduced a more diverse product portfolio of microprocessors, APUs, GPUs and embedded SoCs as part of our long-term strategy to deliver innovative solutions and preserve functioning. We also reconfigured our organizational resources through a restructuring plan that reduced global headcount by approximately 5%, outsourced certain IT services and application development, and consolidated real estate facilities, yielding operational savings and strengthening our operational flexibility. To ensure business continuity and supply-chain resilience, we entered into amendments to our wafer supply agreement with GlobalFoundries, securing commercially reasonable efforts to transition supply and fulfill purchase orders through 2024, and formed joint ventures to provide assembly, testing, marking, packing and packaging services. We believe that our cash position, marketable securities, secured revolving line of credit and savings realized from our restructuring plans will be sufficient to fund operations and adapt to environmental disturbances over the next twelve months, although we acknowledge that uncertain global economic conditions and potential limitations on capital-market access remain risks that could affect our liquidity, risk management and ability to deploy resources effectively.

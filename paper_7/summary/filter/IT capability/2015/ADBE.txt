In fiscal 2015, we completed the acquisition and integration of Fotolia into our digital media segment and previously integrated Neolane and Behance into our digital marketing and digital media reportable segments, reconfiguring our resources and capabilities to absorb market changes and support new service innovation. We have transitioned to a subscription-based business model, introduced Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, and built out the Adobe Stock marketplace to deliver predictable, ratable revenue streams, enhance operational flexibility, maintain integrity of performance under environmental turbulence, and mitigate revenue volatility. In recognition of external disturbances and currency fluctuations, we maintain a foreign exchange hedging program, proactive deferred revenue forecasting and unbilled backlog analysis to safeguard business continuity. We regularly evaluate critical accounting policies, assumptions and estimates and engage with the Audit Committee to mitigate risks in revenue recognition, business combinations, goodwill impairment and income taxes. Our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and interest rate swap agreements provide liquidity and protect against interest rate exposures. We have undertaken restructuring initiatives, including workforce reductions and facility consolidations, to align organizational structure with strategic objectives and preserve operational resources. Investments in data center infrastructure, network operations and cloud services enable scalability and resilience to meet growing transaction volumes. Our stock repurchase program with structured agreements optimizes capital allocation while maintaining financial flexibility. Finally, our practices around income tax uncertainties, indemnification provisions and contractual commitments are designed to absorb strain, manage contingencies and support ongoing organizational evolution in the face of adversity.

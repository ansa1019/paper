In describing its operational context, the company notes that the semiconductor capital equipment industry has been highly competitive and characterized by rapid changes in demand, a cyclicality that has been mitigated in recent years by market demands and consolidation among its customers, and warns that with a reduced number of customers, variability in their business plans may lead to changes in demand for its equipment and services. It further observes that variability in customer investments is dependent on several factors, including electronics demand, economic conditions, industry supply and demand, semiconductor prices and customers’ ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly devices. To maintain positive adjustment under these challenging conditions, the company leverages its expertise in semiconductor processing to develop technology and productivity solutions that benefit customers through lower defect rates, enhanced yields, faster processing times and reduced cost while facilitating their ability to meet more stringent performance and design standards. Operating expenses in fiscal year 2015 increased primarily due to continued investments in next-generation research and development, reflecting a strategic allocation of resources toward sustaining innovation and operational flexibility. As part of its risk mitigation and resource reconfiguration processes, the company recorded a $79 million goodwill impairment related to its single-wafer clean reporting unit, noting that uncertainty surrounding future revenue growth in certain products caused discounted cash flows to fall below carrying value. Recognizing the industry’s historical cyclicality and external pressures, the company emphasizes that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves and short-term investments is important to support R&D and capital infrastructure and that, based on its current outlook, its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at June 28, 2015 are expected to support anticipated operations, investments, debt service requirements and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. It also discloses that while substantial cash balances are held in the United States and offshore, additional funding through borrowings or public or private debt or equity offerings may be required if conditions change, though there can be no certainty regarding availability of such funding on favorable terms. The company further states that its longer-term liquidity will depend on future revenues and its ability to manage costs based on demand, and that it believes it can access capital markets, if necessary, to meet its objectives, highlighting its ongoing preparedness, adaptive strategies and resource management to preserve organizational health and performance under variable external disturbances.

In 2015, Merck continued to execute its research and development-focused strategy, advance its pipeline and commercial portfolio while maintaining a disciplined approach to cost management and delivering capital returns to shareholders, and the company received several product approvals and launched multiple new therapies, demonstrating its ability to absorb external pressures and preserve performance under challenging conditions. Business development is a critical part of the companyâ€™s strategy as Merck looks to combine internal and external innovation to enhance its pipeline and support its in-line portfolio, and during 2015 the company acquired Cubist Pharmaceuticals, entered collaborations to research novel biologic therapies, and invested its resources to grow its strongest brands and support its most promising pipeline assets. As a result of disciplined cost management, Merck has achieved its overall savings goal in 2015 and has in turn reallocated resources toward high-growth areas, and the company continues to review its existing assets through an ongoing portfolio assessment process to determine whether they can provide the best short- and longer-term value. Operating conditions have become more challenging under global pressures of competition, industry regulation and health care cost containment, and although the ultimate effect of these and other factors cannot be predicted, the company continually takes measures to evaluate, adapt and improve the organization and its business practices to better meet customer needs and believes it is well positioned to respond to the evolving health care environment and market forces. In 2013 and 2010, Merck undertook global restructuring programs to sharpen its commercial and research and development focus and to streamline the cost structure of the combined company, including elimination of positions, reduction of its global real estate footprint, improvements in manufacturing and supply-network efficiency, and consolidation of office facilities, and by the end of 2015 these actions were substantially completed, achieving projected annual net cost savings of $2.5 billion and positioning the company for greater operational flexibility. The company has also established revenue hedging, balance-sheet risk management and net-investment hedging programs to protect against volatility in foreign exchange, places its cash and investments in high-credit-quality instruments, and advocates with policymakers to foster a long-term approach to sustainable health care financing, thereby reinforcing its capacity to maintain integrity and performance under internal or external variations and disturbances.

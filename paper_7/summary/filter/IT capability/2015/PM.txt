Philip Morris International Inc. manages its business in four geographic segments and maintains a diversified portfolio of international and local brands sold in more than 180 markets, securing multiple revenue streams and market positions. Its net revenues and operating income are affected by factors such as product volumes, pricing, currency exchange rates and product and geographic mix, reflecting exposure to environmental perturbations and necessitating ongoing risk mitigation and resource deployment. As a holding company, principal funding sources are dividends and debt repayments from subsidiaries, which face no material limitations on their ability to pay dividends or make other distributions. In the fourth quarter of 2015, operations in Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Slovenia were transferred from the EEMA segment to the European Union segment without materially affecting consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. During 2015 and 2014, PMI recorded pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs of $68 million and $535 million, respectively, related to severance costs, factory closures and restructuring of the U.S. leaf purchasing model, while affiliate consultations and social plan agreements preceded the cessation of production at select facilities, illustrating adaptive restructuring under adverse conditions. Income tax items, including reductions in unrecognized tax benefits following IRS examinations, adjusted the effective tax rate and contributed discrete benefits to diluted EPS, whereas higher average debt levels increased interest expense. Operational performance adjustments across segments—such as higher pricing offset by increased marketing, administration and research costs and higher manufacturing costs—drove a $0.53 increase in diluted EPS from operations. For 2016, the company forecasts diluted EPS of $4.25 to $4.35 per share at prevailing exchange rates, representing a 10%–12% increase excluding an approximate $0.60 per share unfavorable currency impact, and will revisit share repurchases depending on the currency environment. The guidance excludes potential impacts from future acquisitions, unanticipated impairment and exit costs, currency fluctuations and other unusual events, with continuing risks described in Item 1A. The company defines adjusted diluted EPS as reported diluted EPS adjusted for asset impairment and exit costs, discrete tax items and unusual items, a measure intended to represent core earnings, improve comparability and aid analysis of business performance and resilience.

Throughout fiscal 2015, management continually monitored global macroeconomic conditions and assessed opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues, undertaking various restructuring actions—including severance and facility lease obligations, asset impairments and pension settlement charges—to reconfigure resource deployment, achieve estimated annual cost savings and support additional investments in products expected to drive future revenue growth; the acquisition of Hittite Microwave Corporation, financed through cash and a short-term loan, resulted in the recognition of significant goodwill and intangible assets (including in-process R&D) and the creation of a new operating segment, demonstrating absorptive capacity, knowledge integration and reconstitution of organizational trajectories to enhance competitive advantage; the company maintained business continuity and operational flexibility by preserving liquidity—$3.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments diversified across high-credit-quality counterparties—by monitoring credit exposures, complying with debt covenants under its senior unsecured notes and revolving credit facility and evaluating the impact of new revenue recognition standards, thereby mitigating risk, preserving system integrity and ensuring readiness for future strategic initiatives; inventory production levels were adjusted to support forecasted demand and to manage variations between forecasts and actual sales, while deferral of revenue on distributor shipments and careful management of deferred income and credits provided safeguards against market uncertainties; a continued commitment to R&D, with hundreds of projects underway and R&D investments increasing 14 percent year-over-year, underscored the firm’s focus on innovative processes and resilience engineering to maintain product leadership under dynamic conditions; projected capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 are to be funded by cash on hand and cash generated from operations, reflecting proactive resource allocation and future orientation; and the company’s disciplined approach to working capital—consistent days sales outstanding, defined purchase obligations subject to cancellation without significant penalties and regular evaluation of long-lived asset recoverability—further illustrates its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite internal and external variations and disturbances.

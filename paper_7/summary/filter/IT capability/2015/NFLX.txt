Netflix continues to allocate substantial resources to content acquisition, licensing and original programming, increasing related expenses by $208.1 million in the domestic streaming segment and $522.1 million in the international segment to ensure continuity of high-quality service and to expand its global streaming network, a strategic initiative supported by the build-out of its own Open Connect content delivery infrastructure. The company adapts to external pressures such as unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations through pricing changes and plan mix adjustments, while scaling marketing and headcount costs—growing technology and development expenses by $178.5 million and increasing general and administrative costs by $137.6 million in 2015—to support international expansion and service innovations. Through proactive financing actions, including $1.5 billion in long-term debt issuances, Netflix secures liquidity for significant upfront content payments and anticipates raising additional capital to fund continued content investments, thereby maintaining system integrity and operational continuity. Multi-year commitments under exclusive content license and production agreements total $10.9 billion, underpinning future performance and illustrating the company’s dynamic capability to absorb strain, reconfigure resources and preserve positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

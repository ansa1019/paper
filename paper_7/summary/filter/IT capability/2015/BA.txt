The company’s strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses—Commercial Airplanes and Defense, Space & Security—supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital, as these segments have historically generated substantial earnings and cash flow that permit investment in new products and services, while the BDS segment integrates resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security, space and services to deliver capability-driven solutions at reduced cost and leverages its core businesses to capture key next-generation programs with an intense focus on growth, productivity and mitigating market cyclicality. Through program accounting, Boeing estimates accounting quantities, sales price escalation and cost-of-sales percentages based on firm orders, anticipated orders, market studies, supplier and labor performance trends, and recognizes cumulative catch-up adjustments and reach-forward losses immediately—as exemplified by the $885 million 747 charge and $835 million KC-46A tanker reach-forward loss—to preserve program integrity and respond to design changes, testing requirements and schedule shifts. The company continues to monitor and address challenges in aircraft production and assembly, including management of its manufacturing operations and extended global supply chain, completion and integration of traveled work, and delivers extensive fleet support services throughout the operational life of its products to ensure operational continuity. In response to lower-than-expected demand and slower cargo recovery, Boeing has announced production rate adjustments on the 747 program, maintains a number of completed aircraft in inventory, and remains focused on obtaining additional orders and implementing mitigation plans and cost-reduction efforts to improve profitability and sustain performance. Boeing also preserves significant liquidity and borrowing capacity through its commercial paper program, revolving credit facilities and selective financing solutions to support operational flexibility, working capital and strategic opportunities, while regularly reviewing backlog, contract commitments, purchase obligations, pension funding requirements and contingent liabilities such as environmental remediation and legal proceedings to enable positive adjustment under challenging conditions and reconfiguration of resources in the face of external pressures.

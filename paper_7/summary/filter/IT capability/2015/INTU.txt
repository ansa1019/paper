Our managementâ€™s discussion and analysis recognizes that our business operates in a dynamic, highly competitive market characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs, frequent new product introductions and external pressures from large cloud-based competitors, and we believe that an understanding of these trends is important to understand our financial results and future prospects; accordingly, our MD&A contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. To maintain operational continuity and flexibility under these conditions, we are investing significant resources in our information technology infrastructure, privacy and security capabilities and data center hosting, and when state taxing authorities and the IRS experienced an increase in attempted tax-return fraud we and certain states suspended electronic state tax filings, implemented additional security measures in our products and collaborated with state and federal governments to combat the activity. We have adapted our offerings by transitioning our QuickBooks desktop and professional tax software to ongoing enhancements and subscription-based services, which has deferred revenue recognition and shifted our resource allocation toward connected services that generated 73 percent of total net revenue in fiscal 2015 and are expected to continue growing. To mitigate financial and operational risks, we continually reassess critical accounting judgments related to revenue recognition, business combinations, goodwill and intangible asset impairment and deferred tax asset valuation allowances on a quarterly basis, reviewing the status of legal contingencies and uncertain tax positions, recording liabilities when losses become probable and updating estimates as new information arises. Our growth strategy depends on our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, enter new markets and drive broad adoption of our products and services, and we evaluate potential acquisitions, technology investments and strategic partnerships on an ongoing basis; this approach is supported by a strong liquidity profile, an unused $500 million revolving credit facility, prudent debt and dividend policies and targeted capital deployment in product development, marketing and sales capabilities. We also track non-financial drivers such as customer growth, retention and transaction volumes and manage risks associated with the hosting, collection and retention of customer data to preserve organizational health and performance under pressure.

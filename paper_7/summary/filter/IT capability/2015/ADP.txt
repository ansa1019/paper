ADP’s annual report discloses a range of practices and capabilities that support its ability to absorb strain and maintain performance under challenging conditions, including the adoption of new technology and service innovation to meet client needs globally, strategic investment in product development and talent to drive continuous improvement, and a high-margin, recurring-revenue business model underpinned by record‐high client retention rates. Management emphasizes its commitment to service excellence and operational flexibility, noting that despite pressure from foreign currency translation, declining interest rates and higher selling expenses, the company delivered solid organic revenue growth, pretax margin expansion and consistently strong cash flows. To mitigate risks and ensure business continuity, ADP invests client funds under prudent and conservative guidelines—prioritizing safety of principal, liquidity and diversification—and structures its portfolio with laddered maturities while maintaining access to short-term financing through commercial paper, reverse repurchase agreements and committed credit facilities. The firm also impounds client collections in advance to reduce liquidity risk, excludes high-risk securities from its investment portfolio, and retains ample corporate cash and marketable securities to meet obligations, thereby preserving system integrity and emerging stronger in the face of environmental perturbations and market volatility.

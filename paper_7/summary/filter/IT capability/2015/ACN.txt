Management’s discussion and analysis emphasizes that the company continuously monitors volatility and macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty and “seeks to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions,” including significant foreign currency fluctuations for which it “seeks to manage foreign currency exposure … by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs” and restates results “in local currency” to facilitate period-to-period comparisons. The company “proactively plans and manages the size and composition of our workforce and takes actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions,” adjusting hiring, voluntary and involuntary attrition, resource mix and pricing to maintain a balance of skills and resources, recover compensation increases and deploy employees globally on a timely basis. Revenue recognition for technology integration consulting and outsourcing contracts is based on percentage-of-completion and other methods with estimates of total revenues and costs “continuously monitored during the term of the contract,” prompt loss provisioning when a contract loss is “probable and reasonably estimable,” and deferred transition costs for outsourcing services that are amortized over service periods and monitored for impairment, with losses recorded when undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover assets. The company maintains substantial liquidity through cash balances, expected operating cash flows and access to a $1.0 billion syndicated revolving credit facility, uncommitted multicurrency facilities and letters of credit, and holds “substantially all of our cash … in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds” to ensure working capital and investment needs are met and operational continuity is preserved under varying conditions.

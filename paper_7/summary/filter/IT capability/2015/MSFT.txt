In fiscal year 2015, Microsoft focused on transforming its organization to support its strategy of building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world; it achieved product development milestones, implemented organizational changes, and made strategic and tactical moves to support its three central ambitions—reinventing productivity and business processes, building the intelligent cloud platform, and creating more personal computing—demonstrating its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under dynamic and challenging market conditions. The company observed that its industry “is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models,” treating each industry shift as an opportunity to conceive new products, technologies, or ideas that can further transform the industry and its business, and noting that “we must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.” To address changing customer demands, industry trends, and competitive forces, Microsoft pushed the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities. It reconfigured and integrated acquired businesses—such as NDS and Minecraft developer Mojang—to strengthen its cloud platform and invest in mobile applications, incurring impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses related to its phone hardware business, and increased investments in devices and infrastructure, including higher datacenter and online infrastructure expenses to serve its growing commercial cloud, even as these investments increased operating costs. Recognizing that organizational health and future performance depend on talent, the company emphasized its ability to attract and retain qualified employees globally by offering an exceptional working environment, scale in resources, career growth across products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. In managing liquidity and preserving enterprise continuity, Microsoft maintained substantial cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments—primarily highly liquid, investment-grade fixed-income securities diversified among industries and currencies—to facilitate liquidity, preserve capital, and mitigate risk, while planning for capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends, and contractual obligations to ensure adequate resource allocation and resilience against external pressures.

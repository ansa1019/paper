In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, Qualcomm announced a strategic realignment plan designed to improve execution, enhance financial performance and drive profitable growth as it works to create sustainable long-term value for stockholders and recorded restructuring and restructuring-related charges of $190 million related to the plan, with expected total charges of approximately $350 million to $450 million to right-size its cost structure and reconfigure resource deployment. The company continues to invest significant resources toward advancements in 3G/4G multimode and 4G LTE technologies, OFDM-based WLAN, converged computing/communications (Snapdragon) chips, graphics, connectivity, multimedia products and software and services, and in targeted opportunities in connected home and Internet of Things, automotive, networking, mobile computing, small cells, data centers, mobile health, wireless charging and machine learning, reflecting its multi-faceted adaptation strategy and future orientation. To support operational continuity and maintain integrity under varying conditions, Qualcomm has established a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility, a $4.0 billion commercial paper program and issued an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 billion of unsecured floating- and fixed-rate notes, with net proceeds used to support its capital return program and for general corporate purposes. The board authorized repurchases of up to $15.0 billion of common stock and the company intends to return a minimum of 75% of its free cash flow to stockholders through stock repurchases and dividends over the foreseeable future, including the completion of two accelerated share repurchase agreements totaling $5.0 billion in fiscal 2015. Qualcomm believes its current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $30.9 billion, combined with expected cash flow from operations and financing activities, will satisfy working capital and other requirements for at least the next 12 months, demonstrating effective resource allocation and risk mitigation. In its supply chain, the company relies on independent third-party suppliers under both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing models and manages purchase obligations of $3.0 billion in fiscal 2016 and $953 million in fiscal 2017, reflecting operational flexibility and inter-organizational collaboration. Qualcomm recorded a $975 million charge resulting from the resolution reached with the NDRC regarding its investigation under Chinaâ€™s anti-monopoly law and agreed to implement a rectification plan modifying certain licensing practices to restore business continuity, and continues to make progress with licensees and negotiate with unlicensed companies to improve reporting and compliance. The company also devotes resources to working with and educating participants in the wireless value chain and governments on the benefits of its business model, underpinning its systemic perspective and resilience strategy in the face of regulatory and competitive pressures.

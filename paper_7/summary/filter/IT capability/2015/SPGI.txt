In 2015, McGraw Hill Financial maintained operational continuity and absorbed internal and external variations by focusing on targeted investments in financial assets, divesting non-core businesses, reducing its real estate footprint and using the after-tax proceeds to fund selective acquisitions—such as its September acquisition of SNL Financial and the purchase of Petromedia and UCG—that enriched its data, intelligence and analytics capabilities to inform customer decision-making, while implementing restructuring actions and legal settlement recoveries to contain costs and safeguard performance. The company’s strategic orientation emphasizes sustainable growth through the execution of cross-segment initiatives, strengthening core capabilities and inter-organizational collaboration, and enhanced performance via risk management, operational efficiencies, liquidity preservation—supported by robust cash flows, a revolving credit facility with disciplined leverage covenants and a commercial paper program—and judicious capital allocation, including $3.3 billion returned to shareholders. Ongoing impairment reviews of long-lived assets and goodwill grounded in multivariate cash-flow forecasting, the proactive management of contingent liabilities and pension obligations, and the rigorous measurement of non-GAAP metrics such as free cash flow reflect an adaptive, systemic perspective on resilience, enabling the firm to absorb strain, mitigate risk, adapt trajectories in response to market disruptions and preserve integrity and performance under challenging conditions.

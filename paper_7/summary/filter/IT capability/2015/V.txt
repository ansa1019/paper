Visa describes itself as a global payments technology company connecting consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments in more than 200 countries and territories to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments, facilitating global commerce through the transfer of value and information and exploring additional opportunities to enhance its competitive position by expanding the scope of payment solutions. The company recognizes that its business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending, noting impacts of “continued uneven and tepid economic growth” on performance. To support business continuity and manage external and internal pressures, Visa “regularly evaluate[s] cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures,” with treasury policies designed to provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios, ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities, pay dividends and repurchase shares, and optimize income by investing excess cash in securities that enable it to meet working capital and liquidity needs. Based on current cash flow budgets and forecasts, Visa believes projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. Its investment portfolio, primarily debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies, is “designed to invest excess cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs,” and is governed by policies that limit credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment, though the company acknowledges that changes in credit ratings, regulatory developments, actions by central banks and monetary authorities, and credit market conditions could impact portfolio liquidity. Visa maintains an unused $3.0 billion commercial paper program and an unsecured $3.0 billion revolving credit facility containing customary covenants and in compliance with all related covenants, providing operational flexibility to respond to unexpected situations. In conjunction with its November 2, 2015 transaction agreement to acquire 100 percent of the share capital of Visa Europe for up to €21.2 billion, Visa amended the Visa Europe put option to align terms and manage potential litigation-related liabilities, and, pursuant to its U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, maintains a litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements or judgments in covered litigation will be paid. Visa’s operating and financing activities demonstrate its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning, as cash provided by operating activities—adjusted for litigation-related flows—reflects growth in total operating revenues and is expected to remain more than sufficient for ongoing operational needs. The company also enters into indemnification arrangements to cover settlement losses if clients fail to fund obligations under Visa’s rules, maintains global credit settlement risk policies that may require collateral from clients failing credit standards, and anticipates that cash flow generated from operations, together with available credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund contractual commitments—including purchase orders, leases, client incentives, marketing and sponsorship obligations and dividends—thereby ensuring resilience in the face of volatility in payments volume, exchange rates and litigation exposures.

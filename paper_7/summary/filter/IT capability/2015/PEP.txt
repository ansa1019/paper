PepsiCo’s 2015 Form 10‐K describes an integrated risk management framework and a suite of strategies and capabilities that together support its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve performance under challenging conditions. The company’s Board-level oversight, supported by the PepsiCo Risk Committee, division and country risk committees, a dedicated risk management office, internal audit and compliance functions, is charged with identifying, assessing, prioritizing, mitigating and communicating top strategic, financial, operational, safety, compliance and reputational risks, thereby reinforcing business continuity and organizational flexibility. Management highlights how disciplined capital allocation, a diversified portfolio balanced across categories and geographies, and a broad set of productivity initiatives—ranging from automating packaging and warehousing processes to remote production monitoring and “smart spending” policies—drive cost reductions, enhance operational flexibility and uphold integrity of performance. Across uncertain macroeconomic, political and social environments, including volatile foreign exchange and commodity markets, intense regulatory pressures and resource scarcity, PepsiCo pursues capability building in commercial, e-commerce, R&D and talent management, leverages hedging programs, global purchasing agreements and fixed-price contracts, and maintains strong liquidity and capital resources to ensure ongoing functioning, rapid adaptation and recovery from disruptive events. Moreover, portfolio refranchising decisions and the deconsolidation of Venezuelan operations demonstrate resilience through reconfiguring legal, financial and operating structures to safeguard long-term sustainable value creation.

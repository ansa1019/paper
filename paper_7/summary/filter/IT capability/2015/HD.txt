In response to the significant data breach discovered in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, the Company completed a major payment security project that provides enhanced encryption of payment card data at the point of sale in all of its U.S. and Canadian stores and rolled out EMV chip card technology in its U.S. stores to add extra layers of payment card protection, recorded accruals for estimated probable losses associated with claims by the payment card networks and U.S. customer class actions, and continues to cooperate with governmental investigations—while maintaining $100 million of network security and privacy liability insurance coverage above a deductible to limit its exposure. The Company’s key strategic initiatives reflect an organizational resilience approach, encompassing a customer experience program anchored on putting customers first and taking care of associates—with re-training and the deployment of web-enabled handheld devices to expedite in-aisle service—plus a product authority initiative driven by merchandising transformation and analytics to refine assortment and deliver innovation, and a productivity and efficiency program underpinned by disciplined capital allocation and continuous operational improvement in stores and supply chain, including Project Sync, a multi-year end-to-end supply chain solution designed to reduce supplier lead time, lower transportation expenses and improve inventory turns. To adapt to evolving commerce channels, the Company is interconnecting retail by piloting a new commerce platform, expanding and deploying distribution facilities to reach 90 percent of U.S. customers within two business days, implementing BOSS and BODFS fulfillment options, and enhancing mobile and digital content to drive traffic, conversion and in-store pickup—resulting in over 40 percent of online orders being picked up in stores. The Company generated $9.4 billion of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2015, issued $4.0 billion of long-term debt to fund $7.0 billion of share repurchases, dividends, the Interline acquisition and $1.5 billion in capital expenditures, maintains $2.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, access to a $2.0 billion commercial paper program with a back-up credit facility, and employs interest rate swap agreements to hedge interest rate fluctuations—measures which management believes provide sufficient liquidity, financial flexibility and operational continuity to support its strategic objectives and preserve performance under challenging conditions.

Vertex demonstrates organizational resilience by maintaining financial strength while pursuing precision medicine and by closely monitoring the results of its discovery, research, clinical trials and nonclinical studies and frequently evaluating its drug development programs in light of new data and scientific, business and commercial insights, with the objective of balancing risk and potential and enabling abrupt changes in focus and priorities as new information becomes available; by investing in diverse research and development programs to balance risks inherent in drug development and support business continuity; by relying on existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash flows from product sales and flexible financing arrangements to preserve liquidity and adapt to reimbursement delays across geographies; by maintaining a corporate compliance program designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through compliance policies, systems and a culture of compliance; by testing intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or upon the existence of indicators, by assessing inventory recoverability and adjusting reserves for rebates, chargebacks and discounts as new information emerges, and by realigning resource allocation and capital structure through strategic collaborative and licensing agreements that include milestone payments and royalty obligations in order to absorb strain, mitigate uncertainty and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions.

Management’s discussion emphasizes that the Company operates in an environment of increasing complexity in global security and constrained economic conditions, and has accordingly adopted a strategy to improve program execution, enhance the quality and predictability of product and service delivery, and accelerate the placement of security capability into customers’ hands at affordable prices.  Recognizing customers’ resource constraints, the Company endeavors to extend its portfolio in adjacent markets near its core capabilities and to grow international sales, while maintaining disciplined affordability initiatives and continuing to invest in technologies, people and technical skills necessary to meet evolving mission requirements without compromising the return of free cash flow to investors.  Management notes that changes in circumstances, including U.S. government fiscal challenges and budget uncertainties such as sequestration and continuing resolutions, may require revising assumptions and could materially affect estimates of future net sales and operating profit margin.  To address these external pressures, the Company continuously shapes its portfolio through independent research and development, acquisitions, divestitures and internal realignment activities—most notably the program realignment of C4ISR, energy solutions, space ground stations and technical services programs among its segments—which are executed to strengthen offerings to meet current and future customer needs without impacting consolidated results.  In light of U.S. government funding constraints, the Company aligns its businesses with critical national priorities, seeks to lessen dependence on U.S. government contracts by expanding into adjacent and international markets, and prepares for potential program reductions, extensions or terminations that could elevate unit costs, disrupt the supply chain, trigger supplier claims or require restructuring or impairment charges that the Company expects to recover through contract pricing.  The Company further describes its long-term, complex contracts—accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method—where risks to technical performance, schedule and costs are identified, monitored and reflected in profit-booking rates, with risk retirements or unfavorable revisions recognized on an inception-to-date basis and full loss provisions recorded when estimated costs exceed expected revenue.  The Information Systems & Global Solutions segment is described as particularly susceptible to budget reductions, lower in-theater support and the fragmentation of large contracts into smaller, price-competitive awards, while services sales across segments have declined as improved product field performance reduces service requirements.  The Company reports it is assessing the impact of a major cyber-security incident reported by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management on its operations and personnel.  To underpin its adaptive capacity, the Company relies on strong operating cash flows—generated chiefly from customer billings and performance-based or progress payments—to fund operations, capital expenditures, debt service, dividends, share repurchases and pension contributions.  The Board’s recent approvals of increased dividends and an expanded share repurchase program reflect a balanced cash-deployment strategy designed to enhance shareholder value and preserve financial flexibility.  Access to commercial paper, a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, and public debt issuances is maintained to manage cash-flow timing and support discretionary initiatives or unforeseen contingencies.  An anticipated tax-free special cash payment from the planned divestiture of the IS&GS segment is expected to provide additional resources for debt repayment, dividends or share repurchases.  Finally, management discloses ongoing environmental remediation obligations—tracked through quarterly reviews, recorded when probable and reasonably estimable, and recoverable in pricing under government regulations—and acknowledges the contingent nature of certain industrial cooperation agreements and joint-venture performance guarantees, underscoring the Company’s proactive monitoring and risk-mitigation efforts in the face of long-term environmental and contractual uncertainties.

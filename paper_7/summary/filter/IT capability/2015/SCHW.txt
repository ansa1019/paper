Charles Schwab’s enterprise risk management framework, approved by the board and overseen by a global risk committee and functional sub-committees, is designed to identify, measure, monitor, and mitigate operational, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, and legal risks that could impair system integrity and organizational functioning. The company’s dual data centers, comprehensive backup and recovery functions and periodic disaster-recovery testing reflect a commitment to business continuity and the recovery of business processing in the event of an emergency. Advanced policies, procedures, and technology controls protect against fraud, cyber threats, and unauthorized access, while ongoing upgrades and standardized platform deployments support timely enhancements in response to evolving client needs. To maintain liquidity resilience under both expected and stressed scenarios, Schwab diversifies funding sources, conducts regular liquidity stress testing, and monitors early-warning indicators while retaining access to committed and uncommitted credit facilities, secured borrowing programs including Federal Reserve discount window and Federal Home Loan Bank advances, standby letters of credit, and an authorized commercial paper program. Capital strength is preserved through target leverage ratios, frequent capital stress tests, intercompany capital transfers, and a formal capital contingency plan maintained under the asset-liability management and pricing committee, thereby ensuring the company’s ability to absorb financial strain, pursue its strategic initiatives and remain a source of financial strength to its bank subsidiary under extreme or exceptional conditions. Moreover, robust underwriting standards, collateral requirements, and allowance methodologies for the bank loan portfolio limit credit concentration and support performance maintenance despite adverse market or borrower events. This institutionalized approach to risk governance, liquidity and capital management, and technology resilience collectively embodies the firm’s capacity to adapt, preserve integrity and sustain performance under challenging conditions.

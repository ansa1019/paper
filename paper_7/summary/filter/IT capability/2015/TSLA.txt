In its 2015 Form 10-K, management outlines a strategic trajectory of resource deployment and operational adaptation intended to preserve organizational performance under both routine and adverse conditions, including significant production capacity expansions at the Fremont factory through the installation of a new final assembly line, body shop, paint shop and increased stamping capability; continuous scaling of Model S and Model X manufacturing alongside plans for the mass-market Model 3; global expansion of customer support, sales, service and supercharger infrastructure; targeted capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion in 2016 to fund gigafactory cell production, equipment for Model 3 and extensive retail, service and charging network growth; application of cost-reduction and process-improvement initiatives to mitigate margin pressures arising from product and regional mix shifts and ramp-up inefficiencies; rigorous risk assessment and liquidity management through a $1 billion asset-based revolving credit facility, convertible note hedging and warrant transactions, customer deposits and resale-value guarantees to absorb working-capital strain and ensure operational continuity; forecast-driven inventory write-downs and warranty reserves and deferred revenue recognition for multiple-element deliverables to maintain system integrity and financial flexibility in the face of demand variability; and collaborative supply-chain arrangements with partners such as Panasonic to integrate battery cell, module and pack production, all of which collectively support the maintenance of positive adjustment and core functionality despite internal or external disturbances.

ABBVIE’s strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, advancing and investing in its pipeline, and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. In 2015, ABBVIE’s worldwide net revenues grew by 15 percent to $22.9 billion, driven primarily by the continued strength of Humira, the global launch of its interferon-free HCV treatment, Viekira Pak, and post-acquisition revenues related to Imbruvica, partially offset by a decline in AndroGel revenues and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. These cash flows enabled the company to pay dividends totaling $3.3 billion, repurchase approximately 46 million shares for $2.8 billion, and invest $500 million to enhance its pipeline through licensing and collaboration activities. The company issued $16.7 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes to finance the acquisition of Pharmacyclics and a $5.0 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement, demonstrating financial resource generation and risk mitigation. ABBVIE remains committed to expanding gross and operating margins through productivity initiatives in supply chain, ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses, and leverage from revenue growth. Research and innovation are the cornerstones of ABBVIE’s business, with a pipeline of more than 50 compounds or indications and a concerted focus on strategic licensing, acquisition and partnering activity to augment its pipeline. The company maintains an undrawn $3.0 billion revolving credit facility, regularly monitors customer credit risk in southern Europe and oil-exporting countries, and establishes allowances for trade receivables, rebates and chargebacks, reflecting a systemic perspective on risk assessment and mitigation. Pension and other post-employment benefit obligations are actively funded, and actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually to preserve plan integrity. ABBVIE’s contractual obligations, including long-term debt and operating leases, and hedge positions on foreign currency cash flows are managed through both fixed-rate and floating-rate instruments, and the company conducts annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles to ensure partial maintenance of performance under internal or external variations.

Ciscoâ€™s disclosures describe a systematic approach to preserving performance and continuity under internal or external pressures by maintaining supply-chain flexibility and firm purchase commitments while monitoring macroeconomic and demand uncertainties to mitigate inventory obsolescence risk; by establishing receivables allowances and financing guarantees based on historical customer credit quality and third-party default frequency rates; by hedging foreign currency exposures; and by holding a diversified portfolio of high-quality cash, cash equivalents and fixed-income securities to guarantee liquidity for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and strategic initiatives. The Company further conducts annual impairment and sensitivity analyses of goodwill and intangible assets under varying economic and industry scenarios, records provisions for warranty, litigation and other loss contingencies, and regularly reassesses uncertain tax positions and deferred tax asset valuation allowances in light of changing facts and regulations. Its credit facility, commercial paper program and customer and partner financing arrangements allow rapid deployment of financial resources for multiyear service contracts and support arrangements, and its ability to reorganize, restructure or exit business units under changing market conditions demonstrates a capacity to absorb strain, reconfigure resources and maintain or improve functioning despite adversity.

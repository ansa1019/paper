In response to an uneven and shifting economic environment, we continued to adjust our air capacity and cost structure to better match prevailing volume levels and leveraged the flexibilities inherent in our transportation network to adapt to changing trends. Initiatives undertaken in the U.S. and internationally included improving network flexibility and capacity, enhancing yield management, increasing operational efficiency and containing costs across all segments. The continued deployment of technology improvements, including facility automation projects and accelerated implementation of our on-road integrated optimization and navigation system (ORION), is designed to increase network capacity and improve operational efficiency, flexibility and reliability. We have also utilized newly expanded operating facilities to improve time-in-transit performance in each region. Productivity gains were realized through ongoing adjustments to our air and ground networks, technology-driven package sorting and delivery efficiency, and restrained growth in aircraft block hours even as export volume rose, thereby better leveraging our network while constraining costs and mitigating resource strain under variable volume conditions.

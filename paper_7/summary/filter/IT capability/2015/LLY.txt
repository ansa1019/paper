We describe a range of resource-allocation, risk-mitigation, and operational continuity practices that collectively support our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adverse conditions. We manage research and development spending across our portfolio of molecules so that a delay or termination of any single project does not materially alter total R&D investment, and we structure collaborations and milestone payments to align incentives and limit downside exposure. We maintain liquidity through commercial paper programs and targeted cash repatriations, believing available cash and market borrowings will meet operating needs, dividends, share repurchases, and capital expenditure requirements despite economic, regulatory, or credit uncertainties. In the normal course of business we face interest-rate and foreign-exchange fluctuations; we address these exposures via a formal risk-management program employing interest-rate swaps to balance fixed- and floating-rate debt and forward and option contracts to hedge major currencies, with gains and losses that offset the impact of market volatility on our assets and liabilities. We continually monitor wholesaler inventory levels, historical return and rebate trends, and contractual terms to estimate appropriate sales returns, rebates, and discount reserves and adjust those estimates as market and regulatory conditions change. We assess long-lived and indefinite-lived asset values— including acquired in-process R&D and integration costs such as those related to our Novartis Animal Health acquisition— against projected cash flows and record impairments when recoverability is no longer reasonably assured. Through these diversified portfolio-management strategies, contingency-funding measures, dynamic hedging policies, and periodic reassessment of key assumptions, we strive to limit the adverse effects of internal or external disturbances and maintain organizational integrity and performance even under challenging or unexpected conditions.

Bristol-Myers Squibb has systematically bolstered its capacity to absorb strain and preserve operational integrity under challenging conditions by transitioning to a specialty biopharmaceutical company that combines the resources and scale of a major pharmaceutical organization with the entrepreneurial agility of a biotech firm, guided by four strategic priorities—driving business performance, maintaining immuno-oncology leadership, sustaining portfolio diversification and exercising disciplined capital allocation—while cultivating a culture of continuous improvement and proactive risk mitigation. In 2015 the company allocated significant resources to accelerate product launches and pipeline expansion, acquiring rights to novel assets, entering multiple collaboration and licensing agreements, expanding biologics manufacturing capabilities and evolving its commercial model to respond rapidly to competitive pressures, patent expirations, foreign-exchange variations and changing market demands. Management continuously evaluates and reconfigures its capital structure—through cash repatriation strategies, marketable securities management, commercial paper issuances and credit facilities—to ensure liquidity and financial flexibility, and applies rigorous inventory management processes under its SEC-mandated consent order, diversified receivables factoring and hedging programs, and detailed contractual‐obligation monitoring to maintain business continuity. The company’s formal governance and disclosure processes, including comprehensive accounting policies for revenue recognition, gross-to-net adjustments, pension remeasurements, impairment assessments and contingencies, are designed to absorb internal and external disturbances, safeguard organizational health and support its ability to preserve or improve functioning and emerge stronger from adverse events.

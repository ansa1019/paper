Gilead expects its existing capital resources, supplemented by cash flows generated from operating activities, to be adequate to satisfy its capital needs for the foreseeable future and does not rely on unrepatriated earnings to fund domestic operations, anticipating sufficient cash flow and borrowing capacity in the United States to meet its operational and strategic requirements. Management continually reviews the research and development pipeline, identifies anticipated R&D activities for each period, and prioritizes and reallocates resources based on scientific data, probability of success, market potential and available human and capital resources to support future growth. The company recognizes product sales net of estimated mandatory and supplemental discounts and maintains allowances for government and other rebates and chargebacks based on contractual arrangements, historical utilization rates and market data, as well as an allowance for doubtful accounts derived from analyses of payment patterns and local economic conditions. Gilead faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and uses foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a portion of its foreign currency risk. As of December 31, 2015, it held $26.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, generated $20.3 billion in operating cash flows, received $9.9 billion of net proceeds from senior unsecured note issuances, repurchased shares, settled warrants and paid dividends, resulting in working capital of $14.9 billion and no outstanding borrowings under its five-year revolving credit facility, which contains customary covenants and events of default. Contractual obligations include commitments for debt maturities, interest payments, operating leases, capital project expenditures, purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and other inventory items, and clinical trial contracts with contract research organizations that, although cancelable, have historically not been terminated. Management acknowledges that its progress is subject to uncertainties, including continuation of an uncertain global macroeconomic environment, healthcare pricing measures, foreign currency volatility, competitive launches, payer mix shifts and other factors that may affect its capacity to absorb strain and maintain performance under challenging conditions.

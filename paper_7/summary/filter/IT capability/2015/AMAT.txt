Applied’s results are driven primarily by worldwide demand for semiconductors, which in turn depends on end-user demand for electronic products, and each of Applied’s businesses is subject to cyclical industry conditions, as demand can change depending on supply and demand dynamics, global economic and market conditions, the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes and seasonality, so that Applied’s results can vary significantly year-over-year, as well as quarter-over-quarter. In light of these conditions, Applied’s strategic priorities include developing products that help solve customers’ challenges at technology inflections, expanding its served market opportunities and growing its services business. Applied’s future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products it provides, with development cycles ranging from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product or a new product, and most of Applied’s existing products resulting from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies, materials and processes, while Applied also acquires technologies to complement its existing capabilities and reduce time to market; management believes it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in research, development and engineering and, as part of its growth strategy, has reprioritized existing spend to enable increased funding for investments in technical capabilities and critical RD&E programs in current and new markets. To preserve operating flexibility and improve business performance in the face of external pressures, Applied maintains disciplined cost management—with marketing and selling expenses remaining relatively flat due to continued cost management efforts and general and administrative expenses decreasing primarily due to lower acquisition-related and integration costs—and executes restructuring and asset impairment initiatives, such as cost reduction measures in the solar business to achieve a lower break-even level and related inventory charges. Applied regularly monitors credit risk in its investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures to manage such risks prudently in accordance with its investment policies. The company also performs annual qualitative assessments of goodwill for impairment, determining whether it is more likely than not that fair value exceeds carrying value and, if necessary, applying a two-step goodwill impairment test; evaluates tax planning opportunities, including the impact of geographical composition of income, reinstatement of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit, and resolution of prior years’ filings on its effective income tax rate; and manages liquidity by allocating resources across operating, investing and financing activities—resulting in cash provided by operating activities of $1.2 billion in fiscal 2015—while maintaining committed credit facilities and debt issuances, thereby allocating resources and reconfiguring operations to absorb strain, maintain integrity and support performance under challenging and variable conditions.

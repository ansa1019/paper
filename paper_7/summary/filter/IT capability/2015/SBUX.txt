Starbucksâ€™ fiscal 2015 results demonstrate the continued strength of our global business model and our ability to successfully make disciplined investments in our business and our partners (employees), while actively managing our cash and investments to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments, effect acquisitions and return cash to shareholders. Cash flows from operations recovered to $3.7 billion in fiscal 2015 compared to $607.8 million in fiscal 2014, primarily driven by lapping the prior year payment of $2.8 billion for the Kraft arbitration matter, demonstrating our capacity to absorb significant shocks and restore liquidity. We expect to continue driving revenue growth and moderate margin expansion through disciplined net new store expansion, leveraging investments in both our store partners and our digital platforms, such as mobile order and pay, and expanding customer occasions outside of our retail stores through our developing international presence, which underscores our focus on operational flexibility, service innovation and business continuity under varying market conditions. We believe future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses, strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities, share repurchases, dividend payments and potential outside funding, thereby maintaining organizational performance under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions. To mitigate market-based risks arising from commodity price, foreign currency exchange rate, equity security price and interest rate fluctuations, we employ a market price risk management policy that quantifies exposures and evaluates mitigation strategies, entering into pricing features embedded in supply contracts, fixed-price contracts and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases, financial derivatives and forward-starting interest rate swap agreements, while monitoring counterparty credit risk. Supply chain initiatives such as improvements in sourcing, combined with sales and operating leverage on cost of sales and occupancy costs, and a portfolio shift to higher-margin licensed stores have contributed to reduced cost of sales and store operating expense efficiencies, partially offset by increased investments in store partners and digital in-store initiatives. We continually evaluate liquidity and funding needs through our unsecured revolving credit and commercial paper programs, maintain compliance with covenants and anticipate issuing long-term debt in fiscal 2016 to provide financial flexibility, thereby reinforcing our capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning in the presence of adversity.

Throughout 2015, we remained committed to our key priorities, capitalizing on opportunities within an improving economy and further pursuing top-line growth through differentiating ourselves with better customer experiences, improving our product and service offering for the pro customer, and driving productivity and profitability, and we continued to enhance our omni-channel capabilities, providing not just the products, but also the services, information, and advice to help our customers at every step of the home improvement journey and build a greater affinity for the Lowe’s brand. Through collaboration between our merchants, stores, and customer experience design team, we leveraged our customer experience design capabilities as well as our larger store format to showcase the outdoor living experience and the holiday décor experience, which drove strong sales and attachment for products during the year. To help customers envision and create their outdoor spaces, we repurposed space, provided an integrative and cohesive assortment of products, inspiring and intuitive presentation and display, and optimal service components across all selling channels, thereby providing better customer experiences that differentiate us in the marketplace. We have strengthened our portfolio of pro-focused brands, re-launched lowesforpros.com to provide pros with an easy online ordering experience, and reconnected with pro customers through targeted marketing and pro-focused events to drive awareness and generate new business. In an effort to drive expense productivity during 2015, we effectively managed payroll hours against customer traffic and improved productivity in advertising through optimized media allocation, targeted digital advertising, expanded social media presence, and reduced print advertising, all while maintaining our customer reach and improving exposure; we also leveraged our scale to achieve cost savings on indirect spend, which improved the flow through of sales dollars to operating profit. With net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $4.8 billion and financing activities supporting growth initiatives, we believe that net cash provided by operating and financing activities will be adequate not only for our operating requirements, but also for investments in our existing stores, information technology, expansion plans, any acquisitions, and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As we move into 2016, we continue to take a prudent approach to managing our portfolio of businesses, making decisions that will shape how we better serve and connect with customers, and with the decision to exit the Australian home improvement market during the fourth quarter of 2015, we will focus our resources on areas of the business where we see greater potential return on investment. In early 2016, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Rona Inc., a major Canadian retailer and distributor of hardware, building materials, and home renovation products, a transaction expected to accelerate our growth strategy by significantly expanding our presence in the Canadian market, and we anticipate financing the transaction through the debt capital markets while maintaining access to our $1.75 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement. For 2015, results were negatively impacted by a $530 million non-cash impairment charge associated with our decision to exit our joint venture with Woolworths Limited in Australia, and we recorded a deferred tax asset related to losses associated with that venture, offset by a full valuation allowance due to the inability to identify present or future capital gains for offset. We regularly assess our capital expenditures, which we forecast at approximately $1.5 billion for 2016—split among expansion plans, investments in our existing stores and distribution network, and corporate programs—and believe that our liquidity position, supported by our commercial paper program, credit facility and stable debt ratings from S&P and Moody’s, will enable us to respond effectively to external pressures, manage risk, and maintain operational continuity under varying economic conditions.

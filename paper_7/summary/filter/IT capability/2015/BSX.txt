Management’s discussion and analysis discloses that cash generated from operations continues to be a significant source of funds for investing in growth, including acquisitions and strategic alliances, managing contingencies and reducing debt levels, and that the company’s investment grade credit profile reflects the size and diversity of its product portfolio, leading share positions, strong cash flow, solid financial fundamentals and financial strategy. The company manages its global businesses on a constant currency basis and monitors economic, industry and market dynamics on an on-going basis to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency, align expenses with revenues, and preserve the ability to invest in research and development projects, capital, personnel and other programs critical to growth. As a result of these assessments, various restructuring initiatives have been undertaken to enhance growth potential and position the company for long-term success, with the 2014 restructuring plan expected to reduce gross annual expenses by approximately $200 million by the end of 2016 and to generate a substantial portion of savings for reinvestment in strategic growth initiatives. The company remains committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development across all businesses, even as the resources required to demonstrate value and gain widespread adoption of new therapies may be significant. Excess cash on hand is invested in short-term financial instruments to earn market interest rates while mitigating principal risk through instrument and counterparty diversification and prudent instrument selection, and direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer is limited. Based on its current business plan, the company believes existing cash, future cash generated from operations and access to capital markets and credit facilities will be sufficient to fund operations, invest in infrastructure, pay legal-related liabilities, pursue mergers and acquisitions and service and repay existing debt, although liquidity plans remain subject to risks and uncertainties. The company maintains access to a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility and a $300 million credit and security facility, and as of December 31, 2015, was in compliance with financial covenants under its revolving credit and term loan facilities, noting that any inability to maintain compliance could require renegotiation or the seeking of waivers at additional cost. As of December 31, 2015, outstanding letters of credit, consisting primarily of bank guarantees and collateral for workers’ compensation insurance, amounted to $44 million. The company continues to assess litigation and other claims to determine amounts it believes will be paid, acknowledging that additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future, which could materially adversely impact operating results, cash flows or its ability to comply with debt covenants. The company disputes certain transfer pricing methodologies proposed by the IRS for multiple tax years, believes it has meritorious defenses, has filed petitions with the U.S. Tax Court and maintains tax reserves it deems adequate, while recognizing that final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on financial condition and results of operations. The company employs accounts receivable factoring programs and de-recognizes receivables sold without recourse to manage working capital. Stock-based compensation expense reflects alignment of employee incentives with corporate performance. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance, establish operational goals and allocate resources. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting based on the COSO 2013 Framework and has concluded that, as of December 31, 2015, internal control over financial reporting is effective at reasonable assurance levels.

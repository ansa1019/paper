The company continues to monitor the actual and potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across its business, supply chains and customer demand, acknowledging risks such as curtailed customer demand, delayed collections and extended sales cycles, and in response has implemented measures to maintain business continuity, support employees, customers and communities, and prepare for the long-term success of its business. In 2020, the company released four emergency response applications, including management and safe workplace suites and dashboards designed to help customers navigate pandemic conditions, manage essential steps for returning employees and support health and safety. The company also canceled its in-person annual knowledge user conference in favor of a digital event experience, temporarily closed most offices, encouraged remote work and implemented operational changes that have not affected—and are not expected to affect—its ability to maintain operations, including financial reporting systems, internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. To support resilience under varying scales of demand, the company continues to invest in the development of its services, infrastructure and sales and marketing capabilities, including expanding data center capacity, enhancing research and development activities and allocating resources for deferred commissions, partner referrals and professional services. Financial resilience is underpinned by principal liquidity sources of cash, cash equivalents and investments, supplemented by debt issuances, repurchases and foreign currency derivative contracts to mitigate exchange-rate fluctuations, and by the generation of free cash flow and visibility into remaining performance obligations, all of which enable the company to adapt to revenue variability and sustain operational continuity.

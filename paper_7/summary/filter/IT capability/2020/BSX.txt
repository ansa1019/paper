Boston Scientificâ€™s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and evolving regulatory requirements demonstrated its resilience by absorbing operational strain and preserving performance under challenging conditions. Management activated a global crisis management team to protect employees and customers, optimize operations and secure the supply chain; launched business continuity plans with a medical advisory group, remote work infrastructure, targeted sales visits and expanded remote physician support; and imposed cost reduction initiatives across travel, events, hiring, clinical and R&D programs. The company adopted a temporary four-day work week with reduced executive and board compensation and adjusted manufacturing capacity by temporarily closing or scaling back plants to align build plans with fluctuating demand. As case levels declined and re-surged, a tiered return-to-site approach prioritized employees with critical on-site needs while maintaining remote work to maximize social distancing. To sustain liquidity, management preemptively amended credit covenants, formed a cross-functional strategic cash management team, completed a $1.7 billion senior notes offering, refinanced term loans and secured full access to a $2.75 billion revolving credit facility, investing excess cash in diversified, low-risk instruments. Throughout, the company continually evaluated asset recoverability, monitored impairment indicators, managed debt levels and reconfigured resource allocations, all while advancing long-term strategic imperatives such as EU MDR implementation, restructuring programs and investments in emerging markets to maintain integrity, flexibility and future adaptability under internal and external variations.

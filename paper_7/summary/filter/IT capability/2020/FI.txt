Management has reorganized its reportable segments through a segment realignment to reflect new management structure and responsibilities following the First Data acquisition, thereby supporting operational flexibility and integration value. We frequently review our portfolio to ensure we have the right set of businesses to execute on our strategy, acquiring businesses when we identify a compelling strategic need and divesting enterprises that are not aligned, and have implemented targeted innovation and active portfolio management to enhance overall value and deliver differentiated client solutions. Following the First Data acquisition, we have implemented post-merger integration plans to achieve synergies from expected economic benefits, including enhanced revenue growth, streamlined operations, cost savings from duplicative overhead and technology synergies, and have realized a significant portion of these synergies. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took several actions to protect employee health, safety and well-being while maintaining business continuity, including requiring remote work, suspending non-essential travel and visitors, expanding paid leave and critical-infrastructure pay, disinfecting facilities, providing personal protective equipment, and adapting operational policies as government guidelines evolved. We managed the pandemicâ€™s financial impact by limiting hiring, reducing third-party spending, deferring capital expenditures, temporarily suspending certain employee benefit contributions, and continually monitoring developments to implement appropriate risk-mitigating actions to minimize material adverse impacts on operations. Our liquidity and capital resources are maintained through operating cash flow, available revolver borrowings and cash on hand, and we continuously assess debt covenant compliance and access to capital markets under varying economic conditions. We conduct annual impairment tests for goodwill and review intangible assets for recoverability, with the determination of fair value relying on estimates of future economic and market conditions and reflecting potential adverse effects of the pandemic. Management employs critical accounting policies and estimates grounded in historical experience and current circumstances, requiring judgment in areas such as purchase price allocations, revenue recognition of stand-ready obligations, and the evaluation of contingent consideration and tax positions. This ongoing process of portfolio optimization, strategic resource allocation, cost management, and risk assessment underpins our ability to absorb strain, preserve continuity and adapt performance under challenging and evolving conditions.

During 2020, UPS began implementing its “customer first, people led, innovation driven” strategy to transform nearly every aspect of its business, enhance speed and ease of access through U.S. ground network upgrades and digital access deployments, and adjust its service mix in response to unexpected business shutdowns and government restrictions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic that significantly shifted demand toward business-to-consumer e-commerce. The Company completed capability enhancements to improve time-in-transit, reconfigured network capacity amid global air cargo constraints, deployed new cost-allocation methodologies to better reflect operational activities, and invested in facility automation, fleet additions and internally developed software to absorb strain, preserve performance and maintain operational continuity under adverse conditions. UPS supplemented its financial reporting with adjusted measures used internally for business-unit resource allocation, performance analysis and incentive compensation, and it maintained liquidity buffers of $6.3 billion in cash and marketable securities, access to commercial paper programs and capital markets, and diversified debt maturities to mitigate financial risks. A definitive agreement to divest the UPS Freight business, accompanied by associated goodwill and asset impairments, illustrated the Company’s strategic reconfiguration of resources to focus on core value drivers and strengthen operating margins, with expected proceeds dedicated to debt repayment. UPS also refined its pension-and-postretirement funding strategy, self-insurance accruals and working capital efficiency initiatives, and planned approximately $4.0 billion of 2021 capital expenditures for capacity expansion and maintenance, all of which reflect a systemic perspective, operational flexibility and future orientation designed to sustain functioning and preserve integrity while emerging stronger from disruptive events.

Starbucks’ fiscal 2020 results reflect the challenges our business faced with the COVID-19 pandemic, which severely impacted our results, particularly during the second and third fiscal quarters, driven by temporary closures of a significant number of our company-operated and licensed stores, modified business operations and reduced customer traffic; we gradually reopened our stores and, since then, have seen sequential improvements in comparable store sales in both our Americas and International segments as transaction volumes continue to climb, reflecting the resilience of our business model and the strength of our brand. To help protect the health and welfare of our partners, we incurred incremental labor costs—including paying wages and benefits to partners unable or uncomfortable working, a temporary wage increase for partners who continued working during this period and additional benefits to furloughed or separated partners—partially offset by qualified tax credits under the CARES Act and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy. In June 2020, we announced a plan to optimize our North America store portfolio, primarily in dense, metropolitan markets, by blending store formats to better cater to changing customer tastes and preferences; during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we closed approximately 100 stores in the U.S. and Canada and expect to close an additional 700 stores in those markets over the next 18 months, recording related restructuring and impairment charges in accordance with our anticipated closure timeline. For our International segment, comparable store sales declined by 19%, with company-operated stores in the China market re-opening in the second quarter and nearly all open by the end of the third quarter; to support our international licensees in their recovery efforts, we extended more flexible development and financial terms, including waiving royalty payments during the fiscal third quarter. Throughout the second half of fiscal 2020, we experienced initial business recovery as our stores gradually reopened under modified operations to meet public health guidelines and evolving customer behaviors and expectations, with our global business recovering steadily, China approaching comparable store sales recovery and the U.S. demonstrating continued upward momentum in sales and profitability. We continue to invest in technologies and innovations to elevate the customer and partner experience and to drive long-term growth; by reimagining our store formats, we are moving swiftly to adapt to new customer behaviors. Absent significant COVID-19 relapses or global economic disruptions, and based on the current trend of our retail business recovery and our focused efforts to expand contactless customer experiences, digital capabilities and beverage innovation, we believe we are well positioned to regain the positive business momentum we had demonstrated prior to the pandemic. We actively manage our cash and investments to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments, support acquisitions and return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and our liquidity strategy includes unused commitments under revolving credit facilities and a commercial paper program. Our market price risk management policy governs the use of hedging instruments—including commodity hedges, interest rate swaps, treasury locks, cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange debt instruments—to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in coffee and dairy prices, benchmark interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, and risk limits prohibit speculative trading activity.

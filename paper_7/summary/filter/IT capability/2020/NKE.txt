Since fiscal 2018, Nike has pursued a consumer direct offense and triple-double strategy designed to double the impact of innovation, increase speed and agility to market and deepen direct digital and retail consumer connections by realigning product creation and category organizations around core consumer segments, simplifying its operating model, reinvesting in high-priority businesses and unifying investments in data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering and inventory management on an end-to-end technology platform to drive responsiveness and operational flexibility. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Nike demonstrated its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning by modifying buying plans, canceling select pre-pandemic factory orders, shifting product offer dates, reallocating excess inventory into digital channels, increasing digital fulfillment capacity, deploying targeted promotions and markdowns, and maintaining digital commerce operations supported by distribution center employees, while enhancing liquidity through a $6 billion senior note issuance, temporary suspension of its share repurchase program and establishment of a $2 billion committed credit facility. Concurrent leadership and operating-model changes were executed to streamline strategic execution, reconfigure country operating models and optimize cost structures, with ongoing monitoring of evolving public-health guidance and the flexibility to adjust the operating plan as circumstances warrant. Nike further reconfigured its geographic structure by transitioning select South American businesses to third-party distributors, classifying related assets as held-for-sale, recognizing a non-recurring impairment charge and anticipating a shift toward sustainable, profitable growth with reduced foreign-exchange exposure. Complementary risk-mitigation mechanisms—including centralized foreign-exchange hedging, factory-cost indexing programs and dynamic working-capital management—have been deployed to maintain system integrity, ensure continuity under internal or external pressures and support Nike’s long-term objectives for profitable performance under adversity.

Our financial performance was strong in 2020, despite the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is a clear reflection of the solid underlying fundamentals of our business driven by the HIV franchise and the increased demand we saw for Veklury, demonstrating our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adverse, extreme conditions. We continued to expand and strengthen our commercial portfolio and clinical pipeline across various therapeutic areas through strategic acquisitions of Forty Seven, Inc. and Immunomedics, Inc., the agreement to acquire MYR GmbH, and through licensing, collaboration and equity investments, thereby reconfiguring our resource deployment and reinforcing operational flexibility. We manage our R&D portfolio by identifying anticipated activities, prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, regulatory success probabilities, market potential and available resources, and by reallocating resources among internal and external opportunities, including pausing or postponing certain clinical trials due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our capital allocation priorities remain to invest in our business and R&D pipeline while maintaining disciplined expense management, and we use foreign currency hedges to mitigate exchange-rate volatility. Looking ahead to 2021, we will continue executing strategic initiatives to expand and strengthen our portfolio in new therapeutic areas, maintain our leadership in antiviral medications, evolve our culture, promote racial equity and support our employees amidst ongoing pandemic-driven uncertainty. These actions reflect a systemic and multifaceted resilience strategy, enabling the company to adapt to environmental disruptions, sustain performance under pressure and position for future growth in a dynamic and complex business environment.

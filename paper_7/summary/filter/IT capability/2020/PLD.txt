Prologis reports that its financial condition and operating results remained strong in the COVID-19 environment, reflecting minimal impacts on operating fundamentals due to the high quality and location of its real estate portfolio, favorable market fundamentals in the logistics sector and significant in-place-to-market rent spreads, while its business continuity, communication plans and technology allowed all functions to work smoothly during this time. All employees continued working remotely or under safe office protocols without any lay-offs and with extended financial assistance where needed, local property and leasing teams maintained properties and helped customers navigate the new environment under established safety measures, and customer requests for rent concessions were addressed through payment deferrals without affecting recognized revenue, of which 98% had been collected as of year end. The company restarted the majority of speculative development projects suspended early in 2020, expects development, capital deployment and disposition activities to accelerate in 2021, and continued to support communities globally through direct cash grants, supplies and donations of over one million square feet of space and $6 million in foundation pledges. On the financing side, Prologis issued $6.2 billion and redeemed $3.0 billion of senior notes, extended its weighted average remaining debt maturity to ten years, lowered its weighted average effective interest rate to approximately 1.9% and maintained $4.8 billion of available liquidity under credit facilities and cash balances, ensuring adequate resources to complete its active development portfolio, acquire or contribute properties to co-investment ventures, meet debt service obligations and maintain dividend distributions. These measures illustrate the organizationâ€™s ability to absorb strain, reconfigure resources, preserve critical operations and maintain performance under external variations and uncertainties.

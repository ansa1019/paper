Management indicates that the company is leading a transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smoke-free future and ultimately replace cigarettes with smoke-free products to the benefit of adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, society, the company and its shareholders; through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation, it aims to ensure that its smoke-free products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements. The company manages its business in six operating segments, deploying product and geographic mix strategies to adapt to varying market dynamics, and notes that net revenues and operating income are affected by the volume of products sold, pricing, changes in currency exchange rates and product and geographic mix. For the year ended December 31, 2020, net revenues of $28.7 billion decreased by $1.1 billion, or 3.7%, from the comparable 2019 amount and were impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the second quarter, with net revenues excluding unfavorable currency decreasing by 2.2% due to unfavorable volume/mix primarily from lower cigarette volumes partly offset by higher heated tobacco unit volume, a $253 million impact from deconsolidating the Canadian subsidiary RBH, and lower distribution fees partly offset by favorable pricing variance. Cost of sales consists principally of tobacco leaf, non-tobacco raw materials, labor and manufacturing costs, shipping and handling costs and third-party device manufacturing costs, with estimated costs associated with device warranty programs provided in cost of sales when related revenues are recognized, while marketing, administration and research costs include costs to develop new products as well as marketing, sales and general corporate expenses. As a holding company, principal sources of funds to service its debt securities are dividends and debt repayments from subsidiaries that are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay dividends or make distributions compliant with law, thereby preserving the resources and operational flexibility necessary to maintain performance under challenging conditions.

The Company’s disclosures describe a range of operational and financial actions taken to absorb strain and preserve functioning under the adverse conditions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that travel bans, quarantines and shutdowns “impacted and likely will continue to impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers and those of our respective vendors and suppliers” across its global manufacturing footprint and supply chain, and that since the third quarter of fiscal 2020 “our manufacturing operations and supply chain generally stabilized at normal levels,” while acknowledging that the situation “remains dynamic” and may require further modifications to business practices, including restricting employee travel, modifying work locations and cancelling physical participation in meetings, events and conferences.  The Company states that its “strategy and long-term contingency planning have positioned us well to weather the current uncertainty,” even as it recognizes its inability to fully quantify or forecast the duration or severity of the pandemic’s effects.  To maintain business continuity and mitigate financial risk, the Company managed its worldwide cash requirements by reviewing funds held by foreign subsidiaries and diversifying investments in high-credit counterparties, maintained $1.06 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2020, and established a $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility to fund working capital, debt repayment and other corporate purposes, drawing $350 million in March 2020 and repaying it within the subsequent quarter while remaining compliant with its leverage covenant.  The Company reallocated resources through “repositioning actions” that recorded $49.4 million of special charges in fiscal 2020 to better align its global workforce with its long-term strategic plan—savings from workforce reductions to be redeployed elsewhere—and incurred $2.9 million of charges to consolidate wafer and test facility operations acquired from Linear Technology, which are expected to yield approximately $60.0 million of annual salary, variable compensation and benefit savings when fully implemented.  Inventory management efforts to balance production, demand forecasts and actual demand led to a reduction in excess inventory, even as days sales outstanding increased to 45 days amid economic uncertainty.  The Company emphasizes its continued commitment to research and development—described as “essential to maintain product leadership” and to provide “innovative new product offerings”—and expects to fund capital expenditures of approximately 4 percent of fiscal 2021 revenue through cash on hand and operating cash flows.  To hedge financial exposures, the Company maintains interest-rate derivatives and foreign currency forward contracts matching the duration of its floating-rate debt and non-U.S. dollar expenses, reporting that a 100 basis point shift in U.S. Treasury yields or a 10 percent currency movement would not materially impact the fair value of its notes or hedging instruments.  Overall, management affirms its belief that existing liquidity, anticipated long-term financing, disciplined resource allocation and operational flexibility will enable the Company to sustain performance under pressure and emerge stronger from the current challenging environment.

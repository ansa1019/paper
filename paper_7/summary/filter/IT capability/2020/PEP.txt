During 2020, as the business confronted a global pandemic, climate crisis and heightened social challenges, management first protected the health of our associates, then secured our supply chain and ensured continuity in manufacturing, distribution and sales, while further strengthening our e-commerce and digital capabilities, reimagining our marketing and pursuing positive outcomes for people, shareholders and the planet. The company has developed and continues to implement health and safety protocols, business continuity plans and crisis management protocols to mitigate COVID-19 impacts, and continuously monitors evolving economic, operating and political environments to identify actions to mitigate adverse effects. An integrated risk management framework, overseen by the board and supported by corporate and divisional risk committees, systematically identifies, assesses, prioritizes, addresses, manages, monitors and communicates strategic, financial, operational, compliance, safety, reputational and other risks. Holistic cost management underpins investments in advantaged capabilities, including a highly agile and flexible end-to-end value chain, precision revenue management, data analytics for granular consumer insights and expanded global business services. The company also evaluates macroeconomic conditions, monitors retail landscape disruption and advances productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging strategies to manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate volatility. These measures support its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under internal or external variations and disturbances, maintain operational flexibility, resource allocation and performance, adapt to sudden disruptive change and emerge stronger from exceptional challenges.

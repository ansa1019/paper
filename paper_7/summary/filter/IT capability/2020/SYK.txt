Stryker faced severe market and supply chain disruptions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, including restrictions on elective medical procedures and government-imposed shutdowns that adversely affected its global suppliers, vendors, distributors and manufacturing facilities. In response to these internal and external pressures, the Company implemented operating expense savings actions, suspended its share repurchase program, prioritized capital allocation toward targeted acquisitions, and advanced projects to develop new products and integrate recent acquisitions, thereby reconfiguring resource deployment to sustain operations and safeguard performance. Stryker continued to generate substantial operating cash flow to fund working capital and capital expenditures, supplemented this cash with debt issuances, commercial paper and increased credit facility leverage, maintained a high-quality financial condition supported by strong investment-grade debt ratings and a global cash management strategy, and anticipated being able to support its short-term liquidity and operating needs from a variety of sources, reflecting its ability to absorb strain, preserve integrity, and maintain liquidity and strategic flexibility under challenging conditions.

In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the company closed its offices, instructed employees to work from home, implemented travel restrictions and prioritized employee protection while working closely with contract manufacturers and supply chain partners who experienced delays, workforce disruptions and governmental restrictions on production and export, funding additional working capital and incremental purchase commitments to drive improvements in supply availability, increasing inventory by $235.3 million to mitigate future disruptions and committing to further investments in working capital as conditions evolve. These measures, together with a cautious review of investment and spending plans and incremental spending increases in the second half of fiscal 2020, reflect the company’s risk-mitigation strategies and operational flexibility to absorb strain and maintain partial performance under challenging conditions. Concurrently, the company has continued to evolve its strategic initiatives—expanding its sales force and channel partnerships, enhancing its highly scalable and programmable EOS software through targeted research and development investments, introducing new products and features, leveraging merchant silicon vendor investments for cost-effective solutions, and repurchasing common stock funded by operating cash flows—to preserve organizational performance, adapt to rapidly changing market and competitive pressures and maintain liquidity from its $2.9 billion balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. These integrated organizational, financial and operational responses demonstrate a systemic perspective, dynamic capability development and resource reconfiguration aimed at maintaining system integrity and functioning in the face of external disturbances and uncertainties.

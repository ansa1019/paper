In its discussion of risk factors and management practices, the Company describes its reliance on successfully managing disruptions in credit markets and maintaining key manufacturing and supply arrangements—including sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements—to ensure business continuity in the face of natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, and disease outbreaks. The MD&A further details the Company’s ability to manage demand, supply and operational challenges associated with epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19 by protecting employee health and safety, working closely with government authorities to keep essential manufacturing and distribution facilities open, and absorbing increased transportation and manufacturing costs while maintaining operations. Organizational resilience is reinforced through the July 2019 reorganization of ten product categories into six sector business units with direct profit responsibility for focus markets and standardized innovation, supply chain plans and operating frameworks for enterprise markets, thereby reconfiguring its structure to drive systemic flexibility. The Company emphasizes balanced top- and bottom-line growth and strong cash generation through multi-year productivity and cost savings programs—spanning supply chain optimization, overhead and workforce reductions and general overhead enrollment reductions—designed to fund strategic investment in product innovation, brand communication, retail execution and value equation improvements while offsetting cost increases. In periods of heightened external pressures, including the current pandemic, management pledges a disciplined approach to investing so as not to sacrifice the long-term health of the businesses to meet short-term objectives, thereby preserving the integrity and performance of the system under internal or external variations. Throughout the MD&A, the Company highlights its capacity to absorb foreign exchange variations, implement pricing actions, adjust product and geographic mix, and leverage total manufacturing cost savings and improved SG&A efficiency to maintain or improve operating margins. Extended payment terms and a supply chain finance program with third-party banks are employed to stabilize supplier cash flow and mitigate liquidity risks, sustaining inter-organizational collaboration and operational flexibility. Strong liquidity is supported by $17.4 billion of operating cash flow, $14.9 billion of adjusted free cash flow, undrawn $8 billion credit facilities and high credit ratings, enabling resilience strategies such as dividends, share repurchases and targeted acquisitions. The Company also uses interest rate, currency and commodity derivatives under a centralized risk management policy to protect its financial position. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets undergo annual impairment testing via discounted cash flows; despite significant currency devaluations and reduced demand in its shave care reporting unit during the pandemic, fair values have remained above carrying values, though management acknowledges that a prolonged adverse environment could trigger future impairment charges. These disclosures collectively reflect the Company’s capacity to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions by adapting organizational structures, reconstituting operational trajectories, deploying resources strategically and preserving system integrity and performance.

Throughout fiscal 2020, Accenture demonstrated its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adversity by swiftly adapting its operations and resource deployment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the World Health Organization’s pandemic declaration on March 11, 2020, we shifted approximately 95 percent of our global workforce to a remote working environment and suspended substantially all business travel to ensure continuity of sales and delivery of services, while developing and implementing a phased return-to-office plan guided by our people’s safety and client needs. We proactively planned and managed workforce size and composition—adjusting hiring levels, voluntary and involuntary attrition, and compensation in key skill sets and geographies—to align our internal knowledge and operational resources with rapidly changing client demand, and we strove to adjust pricing and the mix of resources to mitigate margin pressure. As client priorities shifted, we reallocated capacity toward digital transformations, cloud enablement, software and platforms and security-related services, even as certain industries reprioritized or delayed work, reflecting our flexibility and resourcefulness in reconfiguring delivery models. We also managed external pressures such as currency volatility through contract-level currency protection provisions and hedging programs, maintained strong liquidity by generating cash flows from operations and preserving unrestricted cash across jurisdictions, and optimized our cost structure—lowering non-payroll expenses like travel—to sustain gross and operating margins. These measures collectively underscore our systemic perspective on resilience, enabling us to maintain integrity and performance despite extreme and exceptional conditions and to emerge stronger from a challenging environment.

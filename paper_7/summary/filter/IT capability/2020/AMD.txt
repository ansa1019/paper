During 2020, AMD continued to build on its technical, operational and financial foundation to drive its long-term growth strategy and delivered strong financial performance and further extended its industry-leading product portfolio despite the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although many offices remained open to enable critical on-site business functions in accordance with local guidelines, most employees worked from home, and AMD continued to monitor and take measures to protect the health and safety of its workforce while supporting remote working productivity. The company monitored demand signals and adjusted its supply chain requirements based on changing customer needs and market shifts, and assessed its product schedules and roadmaps to support remote working requirements and address geographic and demand shifts caused by COVID-19. AMD’s operating activities generated $1.1 billion of net cash in 2020, reflecting adaptability in managing accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable and accrued liabilities in response to revenue and expense fluctuations, while its investing and financing activities—comprising purchases of short-term investments and property and equipment, equity issuances under employee equity plans, and debt borrowings and repayments—illustrate ongoing strategic resource allocation and risk mitigation. The company’s liquidity position, with $2.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and an available revolving credit facility, is expected to be sufficient to fund operations and capital expenditures for the next 12 months, with access to capital markets if needed. Critical accounting estimates—such as revenue allowances under ASC 606 determined by reference to historical activity and current conditions, inventory valuation based on anticipated demand and market conditions, and goodwill impairment analyses using qualitative and quantitative factors including industry trends, financial performance and projected cash flows—demonstrate management’s judgment and responsiveness to internal and external variations. International sales accounted for 77% of net revenue in 2020, reflecting a diversified global footprint, and the announced acquisition of Xilinx in an all-stock transaction represents a strategic initiative aimed at strengthening AMD’s high-performance computing leadership and enhancing its ability to absorb strain and maintain performance under challenging conditions.

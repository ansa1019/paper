Berkshire Hathaway operates its diverse businesses on a decentralized basis, with senior managers responsible for major capital allocation while empowering unit managers to make operational and underwriting decisions, supporting organizational flexibility and system integrity. As the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated, essential operations such as our railroad, utilities and energy and certain manufacturing, wholesale distribution and service businesses continued functioning under business continuity plans that included temporary closures of non-essential facilities, work-from-home protocols, staggered shifts, enhanced sanitation, health screenings and travel restrictions, while non-essential businesses implemented employee furloughs, wage and salary reductions, capital spending curtailments and restructuring to right-size capacity for expected demand and preserve capital and liquidity. In our insurance and reinsurance operations, unit-level underwriting, time-value-of-money pricing, bornhuetter-ferguson and loss development methodologies, catastrophe loss thresholds, and provisions for premium reductions and uncollectible premiums illustrate risk assessment, resource reallocation and event management to maintain performance under volatility and adversity. Strategic liquidity management is evidenced by maintaining over $135 billion in cash, equivalents and U.S. Treasury bills, preserving a $20 billion minimum liquidity threshold under our stock repurchase program, and issuing long-term debt with staggered maturities to safeguard financial strength under internal or external variations. Burlington Northern Santa Fe leveraged improved service velocity, productivity gains and cost controls to offset pandemic-related volume declines, while Precision Castparts and Marmon undertook aggressive restructuring and workforce reductions, recorded inventory and asset impairment charges, and reconfigured operations to align capacity with lower aerospace and industrial demand, generating margin improvements late in 2020. Other businesses, including Lubrizol, NetJets, FlightSafety and retail and home-furnishing operations, adapted through cost-containment initiatives, workforce flexibility and operational adjustments, rebounding volumes and earnings in the second half of the year. Our long-duration retroactive reinsurance contracts employ deferred charge assets amortized over expected claim settlement periods to preserve system integrity and ensure partial maintenance of performance under exceptional, nominal or extreme loss events.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we prioritized maintaining a reliable supply of medicines, reducing strain on the medical system, safeguarding employee health and well-being, supporting communities, and ensuring affordability and access, especially for insulin. At the pandemic’s outset, we paused new clinical trial initiations to reduce system strain and have since resumed enrollment when safe, with the flexibility to adjust interactions as conditions warrant. Our ability to operate without material disruption has relied on protecting our workforce and supply chain, instituting targeted measures at manufacturing and distribution sites to preserve business continuity and system integrity. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources—managing cash flows, debt markets access, and research and development spending across our portfolio so that delays or terminations in any one project do not materially affect overall investment levels—to ensure we can absorb strain and sustain functioning under extraordinary conditions. Through a controlled program of risk management that includes derivatives to hedge interest rate and foreign currency exposures, and through strategic patent defense and legal actions to mitigate competitive disruptions, we seek to preserve our financial and operational flexibility. We also deploy targeted acquisitions and collaborations to reconstitute and reconfigure our innovation trajectory, thereby reinforcing our dynamic capabilities to respond to environmental variabilities and emerge stronger from disruptive events. Finally, we monitor legislative and regulatory developments globally, adjusting our strategic initiatives and resource allocations to anticipate external pressures and maintain performance under pressure.

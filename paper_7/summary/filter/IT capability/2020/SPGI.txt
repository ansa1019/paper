The MD&A highlights several initiatives and adaptations that reflect the Company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve performance under challenging conditions, including changes to the allocation methodology for centrally managed technology-related expenses to more accurately allocate costs based on segment usage and portfolio reconfiguration through strategic acquisitions of ESG ratings and Kensho to bolster analytical, AI and data visualization capabilities alongside dispositions such as the sale of its investor relations webhosting business to Q4, all designed to reconfigure resources and foster service innovation. Management reports a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses stemming from non-essential travel restrictions in response to COVID-19 while closely monitoring the outbreak’s impact on business continuity and acknowledging continued uncertainty regarding future operating conditions. Liquidity and capital resources were strengthened through robust cash flows from operations, maintenance of an undrawn credit facility and disciplined debt management and share repurchase programs, underscoring financial flexibility and risk mitigation. The forward-looking “Powering the Markets of the Future” framework emphasizes operational flexibility, enhancement of foundational capabilities, the maturing of risk management, compliance and cybersecurity processes, standardization of technology platforms, interdivisional collaboration and employee engagement in reshaping work environments, as well as disciplined investments in growth areas such as Asia-Pacific, ESG disclosures and digital channels to support recovery and sustained performance under external pressures. Additionally, the Company executed a pension risk mitigation strategy by purchasing a group annuity contract to transfer a significant portion of defined benefit obligations, demonstrating a systemic approach to long-term liability management. Strategic priorities across finance, customer, operations and people—ranging from funding organic opportunities and disciplined acquisitions to enhancing end-user productivity, adapting product delivery via APIs and feeds, nurturing diverse talent, and protecting core franchise strength—together reflect a comprehensive resilience strategy aimed at preserving organizational health, competitive advantage and positive adjustment amid ongoing uncertainty.

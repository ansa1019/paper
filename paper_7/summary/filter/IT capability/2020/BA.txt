The global outbreak of COVID-19 and the residual impacts of the 737 Max grounding have created an unprecedented shock to demand for air travel and significant adverse impacts on revenue, earnings and operating cash flow, prompting the company to adjust production rates, reduce its facility footprint by consolidating 787 production in South Carolina, reduce office space needs by approximately 30%, and assess overall facility requirements in light of reduced demand and expanded remote and virtual work opportunities; to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, Boeing announced business transformation efforts across five key pillars—infrastructure, overhead and organization, portfolio and investments, supply-chain health and operational excellence—utilizing the lower production-rate environment to transform and improve business processes, streamline procurement, simplify transportation, logistics and warehousing, and enhance quality and performance; management continues to monitor key factors affecting backlog, including customers’ evolving fleet plans, market demand, certification timing and entry-into-service schedules, and to maintain a disciplined rate management process, making further rate and delivery adjustments as appropriate; procedures to promote employee safety—enhanced cleaning, adjusted schedules to support physical distancing and large-scale remote work—along with severance actions for approximately 26,000 employees and other cost-structure realignments, aim to preserve organizational health, operational flexibility and workforce adaptability; capital allocation decisions—reducing research and development and capital expenditures by $1.3 billion, suspending share repurchases and dividends, issuing fixed-rate senior notes, securing $9.5 billion of unused borrowing capacity, and contributing stock to pension and 401(k) plans—seek to preserve liquidity and support business continuity; and ongoing collaborations with non-U.S. partners, key suppliers and subcontractors, together with rigorous monitoring of supply-chain disruptions and liquidity pressures, are intended to mitigate risks, reconfigure operations and emerge stronger and more resilient when the commercial aerospace market recovers.

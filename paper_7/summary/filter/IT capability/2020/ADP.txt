During fiscal 2020, ADP demonstrated its capacity for positive adjustment under challenging conditions by activating its business continuity plan in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, shifting over 98% of its global workforce to remote work to ensure uninterrupted service delivery and gradually reinstating voluntary, localized office engagements as health conditions allowed. Executive management prioritized safety and client needs by deploying an employer preparedness toolkit, a dedicated COVID-19 relief information website and over 1,000 feature enhancements to its HCM solutions in response to more than 2,000 legislative updates across 60 countries, enabling clients to run over 2 million reports for loan values up to $115 billion. The company sustained its operations and supported clients through rapidly evolving external pressures by monitoring macroeconomic indicators in real time, executing broad-based transformation initiatives—including workforce optimization, procurement transformation and a digital implementation and servicing program—and leveraging its low-capital-intensity, highly cash-generative business model to absorb downturns while continuing reinvestments in R&D and transformation. ADP’s financial resilience was further underpinned by maintaining solid liquidity with $1.9 billion in corporate cash and equivalents, $9.7 billion in committed credit facilities, robust commercial paper and reverse-repurchase arrangements, and a laddered client-funds investment strategy designed to manage interest-rate and liquidity risk. The firm also mitigated insurance-related exposures through actuarially judged ADP Indemnity loss reserves and reinsurance agreements with Chubb, and sustained its service continuity and strategic agility by repurchasing shares, upholding dividend commitments, and adhering to disciplined capital expenditures, thereby preserving organizational health, operational flexibility, and performance maintenance amid extreme conditions.

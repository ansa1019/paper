Management’s discussion and analysis describes how, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and other environmental disruptions, the Company has implemented substantial modifications to employee work locations and travel, secured approval as a non-bank SBA lender under the Paycheck Protection Program to provide small business loans, and, while noting no significant operational disruptions to date, acknowledges uncertainty regarding future impacts on demand, customer behavior, partner actions and governmental responses. The Company’s resilience strategy centers on embracing disruptive technology trends, entering new markets and strengthening third-party relationships, supported by continued investments in product development, marketing, sales capabilities, information technology infrastructure and privacy and security measures, as well as collaboration with state and federal governments on industry-wide security and anti-fraud initiatives. It underscores the critical importance of maintaining the ongoing operation and availability of its platforms and those of its external service providers, and highlights its strong liquidity profile—with $7.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments at July 31, 2020—and its expectation that cash generated from operations, disciplined resource allocation (including deferring share repurchases in favor of strategic acquisitions), and rigorous risk management and forecasting will enable it to meet seasonal working capital needs, contractual and debt service obligations, and potential revenue reductions over at least the next twelve months while preserving operational continuity and competitive agility in a dynamic, uncertain environment.

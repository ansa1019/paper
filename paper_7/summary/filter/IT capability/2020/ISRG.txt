Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has maintained positive adjustment under challenging conditions by implementing continuous updates to health and safety policies and processes, ensuring continuity of supply through collaboration with suppliers and distributors, and supporting customers’ clinical, operational, and economic priorities via a comprehensive financial relief program that included service fee credits, deferred lease payments, and extended payment terms. To absorb strain from reduced procedure volumes and deferred system placements, Intuitive secured its workforce economically and optimized resource deployment by introducing an extended use program for Da Vinci instruments and expanding alternative financing structures—sales-type leases, operating leases, and usage-based arrangements—that provide surgeons and hospitals with greater operational flexibility and help mitigate credit risk through active monitoring programs. The Company has adopted a systemic perspective by leveraging metrics such as installed base, system shipments, and utilization rates—supported by real-time system logs via internet connectivity—to guide financial and operational decision-making amid uncertain procedure recovery patterns, while acknowledging the inherent uncertainties in such estimates. At the same time, Intuitive continues to invest substantially in priority development programs—phased launches of SP and Ion platforms, advanced instruments, endoscopic and augmented-reality systems, informatics connectivity, and next-generation robotics—by optimizing training pathways, reinforcing supply-chain resilience, and directing research and development spending to ensure the organization can reconfigure trajectories toward longer‐term growth, preserve integrity and performance under external pressures, and emerge stronger from this period of disruption.

Management describes 2020 as “a year of great uncertainty as COVID-19 spread across the globe,” noting that “businesses transformed their operations to protect the health and safety of their employees, customers, and communities.” It states that it “adapted to protect the safety of our employees, our customers, and the communities we serve,” implementing “enhanced safety procedures…based on CDC guidelines” and continuing “to identify and manage risks and train our employees as their work environment changes.” The company “adjusted our demand-driven resources to reflect these fluctuations with minimal disruptions to our customers,” driving “operational transformation” evident in substantial improvements in key performance indicators, such as an 8 percent improvement in freight car terminal dwell and a 6 percent improvement in freight car velocity. Under liquidity and capital resources, the report notes that “we are continually evaluating the impact of COVID-19 on our financial condition and liquidity,” that analyses “inform our liquidity plans and activity…indicate we have sufficient capacity to sustain an extended period of lower volumes,” and that it has maintained compliance with debt covenants and access to $2.0 billion of committed credit and receivables securitization. In the 2021 outlook, management commits to “a multi-faceted approach to safety utilizing technology, risk assessments, training, employee engagement, quality control, and targeted capital investments,” the creation of “an operating practices command center to identify causes of mainline service interruptions and develop solutions,” and ongoing “operational transformation” to “increase reliability of our service product, reduce variability in network operations, and improve resource utilization” through train-length initiatives and structural changes. It acknowledges “uncertainties with COVID-19 and the economy,” “potential customer disruptions,” and “volatile fuel prices” in market conditions, and outlines a capital plan to “harden our infrastructure, replace older assets, and improve the safety and resilience of the network,” with investments to “support growth and improve productivity and operational efficiency” subject to revision if business conditions or regulations change. The report highlights planning for the LIBOR phase-out, stress testing of variable-rate debt and fuel price sensitivities, and proactive environmental measures—including “investments in new technologies, training programs and technology to reduce fuel consumption, and changing our operations to increase fuel efficiency”—as means to mitigate risks. Finally, forward-looking statements are qualified by risk factors, and management indicates it will update its plans and assumptions as circumstances require.

Danaher’s operations, affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic and political factors, leverage geographic and industry diversity, and a broad product, software and service portfolio to limit the impact of any single market or country on consolidated operating results, while individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers to anticipate external pressures. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company activated its business continuity plans, continuously assessed and updated those plans, modified business practices to preserve employee health and safety, developed return-to-work protocols, and worked with suppliers to understand and mitigate negative supply chain impacts; to date, no significant supply chain disruptions have occurred. Danaher is making significant investments, both organically and through acquisitions, to address rapid technological change, globalize manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources, improve responsiveness to customer needs and enhance operational efficiency and risk mitigation. Management’s risk-management framework encompasses maintaining sufficient liquidity and capital resources to fund operations, strategic initiatives and unexpected exigencies, using derivative instruments to hedge currency and interest-rate exposures, and executing productivity-improvement initiatives and portfolio actions—acquisitions, divestitures and cost savings—to preserve performance and maintain functionality under varying conditions and to reconfigure resources toward future growth opportunities.

Visa emphasizes its capacity to maintain secure, reliable electronic payments through its advanced global transaction processing network while adapting its operations in response to external pressures such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The company has taken measures to ensure business continuity and resource flexibility by actively monitoring the outbreak, prioritizing employee safety, remotely operating most staff, reducing operating expenses—through scaled-back hiring, restricted travel and lowered marketing spend—and modifying business practices to preserve performance amid uncertainty. Visa employs a comprehensive liquidity and treasury strategy to manage settlement risk and legal liabilities, regularly evaluating cash flow budgets, maintaining billions in readily available cash and marketable securities, operating an unsecured credit facility and a commercial paper program, and funding a U.S. litigation escrow to insulate stakeholders from specified litigation judgments. The company mitigates market volatility through hedging programs and policies limiting credit exposure and uses non-GAAP measures to guide strategic resource allocation and performance assessments. Visa’s investment in ongoing technology platforms, strategic acquisitions such as the proposed Plaid Inc. transaction, and share repurchase and dividend programs further reflect its dynamic capabilities to absorb strain, reconfigure resources, and safeguard its integrity and performance under challenging conditions.

Management notes that while certain factors such as general economic health, competitive pressures, currency exchange fluctuations and gasoline price volatility are beyond Costco’s control, the company has historically demonstrated the ability to adapt its business model—through adjustments to pricing and merchandise mix, increased penetration of private-label items and expanded online offerings—to maintain performance under these external pressures. The membership warehouse format and associated fee revenue structure are designed to reinforce member loyalty, provide a stable revenue stream and afford operational flexibility via warehouse expansions, remodels and relocations as well as e-commerce integration. Costco’s disciplined investment in merchandise pricing strategies—including reducing prices to drive sales or absorbing cost increases—and its focus on cost control in areas such as selling, general and administrative expenses, healthcare and utilities support its capacity to preserve or improve functioning despite adverse conditions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, deemed an “essential business” in most markets, the company maintained near-continuous operations, reallocated resources toward high-demand core categories, incurred incremental wage and sanitation costs, scaled e-commerce capabilities and leveraged increased sales to improve gross margin and SG&A percentages. Liquidity and capital resource management—comprising robust operating cash flows, cash and short-term investments, diversified debt issuances and committed bank credit facilities—provide financial resilience to meet obligations, fund strategic capital expenditures and pursue growth plans despite uncertainties such as tariff impacts and construction delays. Risk mitigation through self-insurance arrangements, a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and participation in a reinsurance program further insulates the business from liabilities related to healthcare, property, liability and other exposures. Costco’s consistent global operating model, supported by prudent balance sheet management and strategic capital allocation, demonstrates its ability to absorb strain, reconfigure resource deployment and preserve organizational integrity and profitability across diverse markets and challenging circumstances.

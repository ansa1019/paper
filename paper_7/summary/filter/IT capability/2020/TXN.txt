Management’s discussion and analysis describes a set of capabilities and strategies that align with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions (Vogus & Sutcliffe, 2007:3418) and the ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity.  The company has long maintained a business continuity plan for unforeseeable situations such as the dynamic and uncertain COVID-19 pandemic and continues to monitor and assess implications for its business, supply chain and customer demand.  Over the past several years, TI invested in building inventory and expanding its global internally owned manufacturing footprint, giving it flexibility to build products across multiple sites and helping to minimize disruptions.  TI’s strategy to maximize long-term free cash flow per share centers on four sustainable competitive advantages—a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology that provides lower costs and greater control of its supply chain; a broad analog and embedded processing portfolio offering deeper insight and knowledge of customer needs; extensive market channel reach reducing single-point dependency and extending returns; and diversity and longevity of products, markets and customer positions—each element reinforcing its capacity to respond to environmental perturbations and reconfigure resources under varying factory loadings.  Discipline in capital allocation—spanning R&D project selection, development of new capabilities, investments in manufacturing capacity and disciplined returns of cash to owners—combined with a relentless pursuit of efficiency to generate more output for every dollar spent, further underscores TI’s operational flexibility and resourcefulness.  The company’s substantial liquidity, comprising undrawn revolving credit facilities, cash, short-term investments and robust cash flow from operations, supports its preparedness to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividends, debt-related payments and other business requirements for at least the next twelve months and positions it to emerge stronger from unexpected or extreme conditions.

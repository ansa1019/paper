In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, our workforce has had and continues in most instances to spend a significant amount of time working from home, international travel has been severely curtailed and many of our productions continue to experience disruption, as are the productions of our third-party content suppliers, and while we and our partners have resumed productions and related operations in many parts of the world, our ability to produce content remains affected by the pandemic; in response, governments around the world have enacted various measures, some of which have been subsequently rescinded, modified or reinstated, and we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, local or foreign authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and stockholders, although it is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our customers, suppliers or vendors, or on our financial results.  As our cash provided by operating activities improved in 2020, we anticipate that our future capital needs from the debt market will be more limited compared to prior years and our ability to obtain this or any additional financing will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing, and while we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all—and if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution—as our cash provided by operating activities grows and exceeds our minimum cash needs, our future capital allocation may include stock repurchase programs.  Our primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, streaming delivery, marketing programs and personnel-related costs, and cash payment terms for non-original content have historically been in line with the amortization period, whereas investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content; for example, production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized, and we expect to continue to significantly increase our investments in global content, particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity, although we currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources, including our revolving credit facility, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next twelve months.  We have built our own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the Internet, and delivery expenses therefore include equipment costs related to Open Connect, payroll and related personnel expenses and all third-party costs, such as cloud computing costs, associated with delivering content over the Internet.  In assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the major recurring differences are excess content payments over amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, non-cash remeasurement gain/loss on our euro-denominated debt, and other working capital differences; net cash provided by operating activities increased $5,314 million from the year ended December 31, 2019 to $2,427 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily driven by a $4,840 million or 24% increase in revenues coupled with a decrease in cash payments for content assets, where payments for content assets decreased $2,074 million as compared to the increase in the amortization of content assets of $1,591 million, and in addition we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses, primarily related to increased headcount to support our continued improvements in our streaming service and our international expansion, whereas net cash used in investing activities increased due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment and net cash provided by financing activities decreased primarily due to a decrease in the proceeds from the issuance of debt, partially offset by an increase in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock.  Content assets (licensed and produced) are capitalized and amortized in “cost of revenues” over the shorter of each title’s contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability and on an accelerated basis—over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability—and we review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis, with estimates related to these factors requiring considerable management judgment.  In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results and our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, noting that the assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and that actual results may differ from these estimates.  We do not have transactions with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us.

Management acknowledges that products are manufactured based on estimates of customers’ future demand and that our manufacturing lead times are very long, which could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or excess inventory; to address this, the company may build inventory for anticipated periods of growth, place non-cancellable inventory orders significantly in advance of normal lead times, and pay premiums or provide deposits to secure normal and incremental future supply. The discussion of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic notes its unprecedented impact on global economic activity and supply chain disruptions—including restrictions on travel, temporary business closures and remote working arrangements—which have led to stronger demand globally and limited the availability of capacity and components and may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial results. The reorganization of our reportable segments to “graphics” and “compute & networking,” the pending Arm acquisition subject to customary regulatory consents and closing conditions, and the integration of Mellanox products illustrate reconfiguration of organizational structures, resource deployment and strategic planning under regulatory and operational uncertainty. We believe our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper, credit facilities and cash generated by operations, will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months, and we continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can adequately and efficiently finance our capital requirements beyond twelve months. Our critical accounting policies—including fair value estimates for business combinations, inventory provisions to write down inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value based on future demand assumptions, annual goodwill impairment assessments, and measurement-period adjustments—demonstrate our risk-assessment mechanisms and adaptability to internal and external variations and constraints to preserve or improve functioning in the presence of pressures, uncertainties and disruptions.

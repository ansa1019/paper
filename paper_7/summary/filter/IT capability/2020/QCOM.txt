Management’s discussion discloses that “the rapid, global spread of COVID-19 has negatively impacted consumer demand for certain devices that incorporate our products and intellectual property,” yet “the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ability to fulfill customer orders has been minimal,” with workforce changes implemented in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 remaining in effect throughout the year; the Company underscores that it “has not experienced, and … does not anticipate a material adverse impact on our ability, or our suppliers’ ability, to manufacture and test our products or on our ability to provide our products to our customers,” while acknowledging “significant economic uncertainty” and that “the degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain.” The discussion further highlights seasonality and demand fluctuations in the QCT and QTL reportable segments, noting that revenues historically “fluctuated based on consumer demand … and/or innovation cycles” and that 2020 trends “were impacted by the decline in consumer demand resulting from COVID-19.” As part of its strategic response to external pressure and environmental disruption, the Company affirms the importance of remaining “a leader in 5G technology development, standardization, intellectual property creation and licensing of 5G technologies, and to be a leading developer and supplier of 5G integrated circuit products” to “sustain and grow our business long term,” with anticipated near-term increases in research and development investment and share-based compensation expense. The Company describes efforts to adapt its supply chain, noting that “it will take time for us to adapt our supply chain process” to realize full benefit from increased demand, and identifies principal liquidity sources—“existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations and cash provided by our debt programs”—as well as a $4.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility to support working capital and mitigate funding risks, while cautioning that “COVID-19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which may adversely impact the cost of and access to capital.” Additionally, the Company recognizes that unfavorable regulatory or legal resolutions “could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows,” and articulates resilience-oriented governance and financial practices, including monitoring investments for impairment, valuing inventory “at the lower of cost or net realizable value considering judgments related to future demand and market conditions,” assessing and recording tax and legal reserves “when the loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated,” and periodically evaluating its capital return program to balance liquidity against shareholder returns.

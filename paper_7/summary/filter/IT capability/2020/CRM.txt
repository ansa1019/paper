In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took actions focused on maintaining business continuity, supporting our employees, helping our customers and communities and preparing for the future and long-term success of our business. Our global work-from-home policy and limited business travel contributed to our income from operations in fiscal 2021, and we continue to evaluate and reconfigure our office space needs, recording impairments to real estate leases as select locations are exited. As part of our current strategic realignment, we have redirected resources from areas that no longer align with our business priorities into key growth and strategic areas, including increased investments in our go-to-market and product efforts, which has resulted in incremental operating expenses and a negative impact to operating cash flows but positions us for future growth. We offered temporary financial flexibility to some customers and changed billing frequencies, mitigating revenue constraints and maintaining customer relationships. We regularly evaluate acquisitions and investment opportunities in complementary businesses, services and technologies to expand our service offerings and nurture our ecosystem, and we intend to continue to make investments and acquisitions in the future to drive innovation and system resilience. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and borrowing capacity under our credit facility, together with cash provided by operating activities and contracted unbilled subscription amounts, will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months, and we may adjust the pace of infrastructure investments, including offices, information technology and data centers, in response to evolving business environment uncertainties. Additionally, we mobilized cross-organizational initiatives to protect workforce safety by closing offices, providing work-from-home allowances and enhancing communication, launched new solutions such as Work.com and Vaccine Cloud to help customers respond to external disruptions, and continued substantial investments in cybersecurity, privacy, equality and social capital programs, thereby enhancing our adaptive capacity and preserving our operational integrity under challenging conditions.

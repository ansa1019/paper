The company reports that it operates in a complex global security and economic environment and has adopted a disciplined, program-execution focus—improving quality, predictability and affordability while investing in technology and our workforce—to maintain continuity of mission-critical operations under stress. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented health and safety measures (personal protective equipment, social distancing, sanitization, alternate work schedules), established a flexible teleworking policy, adjusted site staffing levels, and collaborated closely with customers and suppliers to minimize disruptions to our global supply chain, including accelerated progress payments and supplier prepayments to sustain critical production. Designated as part of the Department of Homeland Security’s critical infrastructure, our U.S. facilities maintained essential operations, managing production rate adjustments (notably on the F-35 program), mitigating supplier delays through schedule adjustments and alternate sourcing, and preparing for varying international responses to travel and quarantine restrictions. We have continued to innovate through acquisitions, divestitures and internal realignments to strengthen our portfolio, maintaining backlog visibility with both funded and unfunded orders, and preserve liquidity and operational flexibility through strong operating cash flows, active debt management and a balanced capital deployment strategy that includes capital expenditures, R&D and pension liability hedging via annuity buy-in and buy-out transactions. Throughout, we engage with customers, employees, suppliers and communities to address evolving risks, sustain critical capabilities and adapt our assumptions and planning for future pandemic developments, budgetary uncertainties and shifts in funding priorities.

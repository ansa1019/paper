Oracle has structured its enterprise information technology offerings through flexible and interoperable deployment models—on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid—to offer choice and flexibility to customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit their needs, and to address evolving customer demand we have introduced programs for customers to pivot their applications and infrastructure licenses and the related license support to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate and expand existing workloads. We expect these trends to continue and believe they will contribute to future growth in our cloud and license business’s revenues, enabling us to continue to make investments in research and development to develop and improve our cloud and license products and services, and similarly we expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware offerings. Our selective and active acquisition program remains a core element of our corporate strategy, under which we have invested billions of dollars to acquire complementary companies, products, services and technologies and may acquire additional businesses as compelling opportunities arise. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we curtailed a number of variable expenditures, including marketing and travel expenses, and continue to monitor the impacts on our revenues and expenses, while we believe our liquidity from operations, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, combined with debt financing capacity and available borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligations and to fund future acquisitions, dividend payments and stock repurchases. We further employ critical accounting policies, risk assessments, derivative contracts and constant currency presentations to manage foreign exchange fluctuations, assess performance excluding currency effects and maintain integrity in our financial reporting, thereby supporting operational continuity, performance maintenance and our ability to adapt under internal and external variations and disturbances.

Throughout fiscal 2021, the company absorbed significant strain from the global COVID-19 pandemic and related government restrictions by temporarily closing approximately 24% of store days across its segments and transitioning to remote work where possible, while preserving associate health and continuity of operations through the establishment of global task force teams, implementation of enhanced health and safety protocols—including social distancing measures, personal protective equipment, protective shields, enhanced cleaning regimens and occupancy monitoring—and discretionary appreciation bonuses and continued benefits for furloughed associates; it maintained business continuity by sustaining e-commerce operations, negotiating rent deferrals with later repayment, extending payment terms on merchandise orders to bolster operating cash flows, and qualifying for various government payroll assistance programs that collectively reduced expenses by approximately $500 million; the company realigned its European supply chain in response to new Brexit trade requirements to reduce cross-border volume and established additional systems and resources to support merchandise flow despite increased customs duties; to mitigate financial risks and preserve liquidity, it generated $4.6 billion of operating cash flow, increased revolving credit capacity by $500 million, issued $4 billion of senior notes in the first quarter and refinanced $1.1 billion in higher-interest debt in the fourth quarter, recorded a $312 million pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt, suspended share repurchases, declared dividends when prudent, and planned capital expenditures of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in line with long-term infrastructure and growth objectives; further adaptive measures included the temporary introduction of an “open-only comp store sales” metric to more accurately assess store performance under closure disruptions, inventory revaluations and markdowns of approximately $0.4 billion alongside impairment charges of $72 million for triggering events related to store assets, and ongoing cost-saving initiatives across variable and discretionary spending to safeguard financial strength and operational flexibility under unpredictable external pressures.

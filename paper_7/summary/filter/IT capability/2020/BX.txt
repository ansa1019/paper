Blackstone’s disclosures describe a number of operational and organizational measures that, while not labeled “resilience,” nonetheless reflect the firm’s ability to absorb strain and maintain functioning under extraordinary conditions.  In response to the global outbreak of COVID-19, Blackstone’s “primary focus has been the safety and wellbeing of our employees and their families, as well as the seamless functioning of the firm in serving our limited partner investors … and our shareholders,” with the majority of employees working remotely under “rigorous protocols for remote work” supported by a “robust” technology infrastructure and increased cadence of group calls, frequent leadership communications and videoconferencing with clients in lieu of in-person meetings.  Investment committees “continue to convene as needed,” and “the firm continues to operate across investment, asset management and corporate support functions,” reflecting operational continuity and flexibility.  Since July 2020, U.S. and European offices have begun voluntary returns under government-approved testing, contact-tracing, social distancing and safety protocols, with continuous monitoring of public health guidance.  Across its four globally integrated segments—Real Estate, Private Equity, Hedge Fund Solutions and Credit & Insurance—Blackstone has reconfigured its organizational structure and segment definitions (for example, renaming and reclassifying stock and credit segments) to align resources and knowledge, deploy capital efficiently, adapt to market conditions, manage external pressures and maintain positive adjustment and performance under challenging and rapidly evolving business environments.  These disclosures illustrate the firm’s systemic perspective on crisis response, resource allocation, strategic adaptation and business continuity in the face of pandemic-related disruptions.

In fiscal 2020, we delivered growth in margins and earnings per share in a very challenging environment with the COVID-19 pandemic, during which we continued to operate in a challenging macroeconomic and highly competitive environment, saw broad-based weakening in global markets and expect ongoing uncertainty, yet remained focused on accelerating innovation and aggressively investing in priority areas to drive profitable growth over the long term. During this extraordinary time, our priority has been supporting our employees, customers, partners and communities while positioning Cisco for the future, as the pandemic has driven organizations across the globe to digitize their operations and support remote workforces at a faster speed and greater scale than ever before; most of our global workforce is working from home through a seamless transition enabled by a long-standing flexible work policy and technologies designed to allow organizations to stay connected, secure and productive, while those who must remain on site are protected with health and safety precautions. We introduced free offers and trials for our Webex and security technologies to help customers shift entire workforces to remote operations, and announced a Cisco Capital business resiliency program leveraging currently available funds to provide organizations with access to financing solutions to offer financial flexibility and support business continuity, helping customers and partners access the technology they need now, invest for recovery and defer most payments until early 2021. We remain focused on providing the technology and solutions our customers need to accelerate their digital organizations, with a mission to inspire new possibilities by helping transform infrastructure, expand applications and analytics, address security needs and empower teams, and a vision to deliver highly secure, software-defined, automated and intelligent platforms. Our systemic perspective on resilience extends to supply chain and working capital management, as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility and competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence, and rely on a strong cash and cash equivalents position, available investments and free cash flow to support strategic R&D, acquisitions, customer financing activities, capital expenditures, stock repurchases, dividends and satisfy contractual obligations, thereby preserving our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity.

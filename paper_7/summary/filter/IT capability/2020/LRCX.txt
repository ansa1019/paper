In fiscal year 2020, we experienced COVID-19-related production and supply chain disruptions, which impacted the timing of revenue recognition and negatively affected our gross margin; although we are seeing improvements in our operations and those of our suppliers, uncertainties related to the pandemic may continue to influence our revenue and gross margin, while we believe that secular demand for semiconductors and industry technology inflections such as 3D device scaling and multiple patterning will drive sustainable growth and expand our served addressable market. Our customer support business group devotes resources to delivering solutions that satisfy technical requirements and productivity needs throughout the equipment lifecycle, and we continuously invest in research and development programs relating to sustaining engineering, product and process development, and feasibility studies to foster innovation and adaptability. We leverage cycles of learning from our broad installed base and collaborate with ecosystem partners to develop multi-product solutions that enhance value and reinforce our competitive positioning. We maintain sufficient liquidity reserves, evidenced by $7.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility with an expansion option, and a backstopped commercial paper program, and we have issued senior notes across multiple maturities to secure funding flexibility; anticipated cash flows from operations, combined with existing liquidity, are expected to support operations, investments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, capital redistributions, and dividends through at least the next twelve months, although market and demand uncertainties may necessitate additional funding, and there can be no assurance that such funding will be available on favorable terms. We apply comprehensive risk assessment and management practices across critical accounting policies and estimates—including revenue recognition under ASC 606, inventory valuation based on market forecasts and technological obsolescence, warranty reserves reflecting actual costs compared to estimates, uncertain tax positions reassessed quarterly, and evaluations of long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment—thereby enabling timely adjustments that preserve financial integrity and performance. Our contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements, such as operating and finance leases, purchase obligations, and guarantees to lessors and customers, are structured to ensure operational flexibility and business continuity, while our capital allocation decisions—including share repurchases, dividend payments, and capital expenditures—are aligned with sustaining our strategic initiatives and adapting to environmental perturbations. Collectively, our global presence, core competencies in nanoscale applications, chemistry, plasma and fluidics, advanced systems engineering, and integrated hardware, materials, and software process control positions underscore our organizational strength, operational agility, and capacity to maintain continuity and performance under both nominal and challenging conditions.

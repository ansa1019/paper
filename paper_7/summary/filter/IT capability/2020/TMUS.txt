The merger enhanced our spectrum portfolio, increased our customer base, altered our product mix by increasing the portion of customers who finance their devices with leasing programs and created opportunity for synergies in our operations, and while we anticipated an initial increase in combined operating costs, we expect those costs to decrease as we realize synergies; merger-related costs generally include integration costs to achieve efficiencies in network, retail, information technology and back-office operations, restructuring costs, including severance, store rationalization and network decommissioning, and transaction costs, including legal and professional services, all excluded from adjusted EBITDA as not reflective of ongoing operating performance; upon closing of the merger, we began implementing restructuring initiatives to realize cost efficiencies from the merger, the major activities of which include contract termination costs associated with rationalization of retail stores, distribution channels, duplicative network and backhaul services, severance costs associated with reduction of redundant processes and functions and the decommissioning of certain small cell sites and distributed antenna systems to achieve synergies in network costs; we expect our principal sources of funding—including cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from debt and equity financings, financing leases, the sale of certain receivables, financing arrangements of vendor payables and our new secured term loan and revolving credit facilities—to be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements and anticipated payments associated with the restructuring initiatives; in connection with the divestiture of our prepaid business, we entered into a master network services agreement providing for the provisioning of network services to the prepaid customers for up to seven years, with the resulting wholesale revenues replacing the contributions of the divested business in our adjusted EBITDA to reflect ongoing operating performance; in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our focus has been on providing crucial connectivity to our customers and impacted communities while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees—temporarily closing and then substantially reopening our stores in compliance with state regulations, supplementing pay and commissions, providing incremental paid time off, implementing remote working arrangements and enhanced sanitation practices; we committed to the FCC’s Keep Americans Connected pledge, pledging not to terminate service or assess late fees for residential or small business customers unable to pay because of pandemic-related disruptions, and provided unlimited high-speed smartphone data, mobile hotspot allowances, additional data for lifeline and educational initiatives, free international calling to heavily impacted countries, virtual selling and curbside pickup, and temporary deployment of additional 600 MHz spectrum that effectively doubled nationwide LTE capacity—all measures undertaken to keep our network fully operational as an essential service for first responders, 911 communications and our customers while adhering to governmental guidelines; we continue to monitor the pandemic and its impacts, adjust our actions as needed, reevaluate spending across marketing, capital projects, travel, third-party services and other operating expenses given the significant uncertainty around the magnitude and duration of any recessionary impacts, and assess potential impacts—including lower net customer additions from reduced store traffic, lower equipment revenues, higher bad debt expense, continued employee and customer support costs and potential supply chain disruptions—on our business, operations and financial results.

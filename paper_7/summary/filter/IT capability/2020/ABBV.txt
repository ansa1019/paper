AbbVie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, maximizing the benefits of the Allergen acquisition, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. Following the closing of the Allergen acquisition, AbbVie implemented an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization, expected to realize more than $2 billion of annual cost synergies over a three-year period with approximately 50 percent in R&D, 40 percent in SG&A and 10 percent in cost of products sold, and anticipates incurring approximately $2 billion of charges through 2022 consisting of severance and employee benefit costs and other integration expenses. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, AbbVie partnered with global authorities to support the experimental use of multiple assets for treatment efficacy, entered into a collaboration with Harbour Biomed, Utrecht University and Erasmus Medical Center to develop a novel antibody therapeutic, and donated $35 million to increase healthcare capacity, supply critical equipment and deliver essential supplies, while continuing to closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources globally to help ensure an uninterrupted supply of medicines and monitoring clinical trial sites locally to protect participants, staff and employees. AbbVie remains committed to driving continued expansion of operating margins through leverage from revenue growth, realization of expense synergies from the Allergen acquisition, productivity initiatives in supply chain and ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses. The company maintains financial flexibility to fund obligations through cash on hand, operations and debt issuance, currently holds a $4.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility in compliance with covenants and believes it has sufficient liquidity to support its growth objectives, while monitoring risks related to customer and supplier solvency, financial ratios and credit ratings.

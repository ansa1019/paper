Our MD&A discloses that we systematically allocate resources to improve and expand information technology and financial infrastructure, operating and administrative systems, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes efficiently, in order to sustain growth and operational continuity under varying conditions. We monitor key financial metrics such as cash flow provided by operating activities to analyze our performance without non-cash effects and to manage our cash needs. As of July 31, 2020, we held $4.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, maintained an undrawn $400 million revolving credit facility, and issued convertible senior notes due 2023 and 2025, providing strategic financial flexibility to absorb strain and preserve functioning in the face of adversity. We continue investing in innovation and acquiring complementary businesses, including Zingbox, Aporeto, and CloudGenix, to reconfigure and extend our security portfolio and enhance our competitive position. In response to the adverse conditions created by COVID-19, we instituted a global work-from-home policy in March 2020, did not incur significant disruptions to work operations, limited employee travel, and transitioned in-person events to virtual or postponed them, while actively monitoring and responding to developments to protect employee health, support end-customers and partners, and maintain business continuity. We operate a two-tiered indirect fulfillment model with a field sales force and channel partners to diversify revenue streams and secure deployment across end-customers, and we believe that ongoing cash flow from operations, existing liquidity, and financing capacity will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs, although unpredictability in customer spending and macroeconomic factors may affect our ability to preserve performance under pressure.

Amgen operates in one business segment and employs integrated activities to maintain and strengthen its competitive position across multiple therapeutic areas, advancing its innovative pipeline, successfully integrating acquisitions, expanding internationally and providing uninterrupted supply of its medicines globally through the COVID-19 pandemic, thereby demonstrating operational flexibility and business continuity under extreme and unexpected conditions. The company adopted remote working arrangements in accordance with health and safety protocols to minimize employee risk without significantly affecting its ability to maintain critical business operations or medicine supply and continuously monitors and reevaluates clinical study enrollment on an institution-by-institution basis—pausing or supporting trial sites as uncertainty arises to ensure subject safety and data integrity—illustrating its capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning amid external pressures. Amid increased competition from biosimilars and generics and environmental turbulence, Amgen maintained a strategic and disciplined approach to capital allocation—optimizing its capital structure through strategic transactions, debt issuances and retirements, syndicated credit facilities, currency and interest rate hedges, and share repurchase and dividend programs—while ensuring adequate funding for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and research and development activities, reflecting dynamic resource reconfiguration, risk mitigation and readiness to respond to disruptive events. Its investment policy prioritizes safety of principal, prudent liquidity and acceptable risk, and it leverages cash generated from operations and access to financing to adapt to market volatility, sustain pipeline progress and allocate resources toward growth opportunities, thereby preserving or enhancing organizational performance and resilience in the presence of adversity.

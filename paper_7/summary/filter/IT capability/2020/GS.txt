Goldman Sachs describes a comprehensive, system-wide approach to maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including a detailed balance-sheet planning process that projects total assets and funding over a multi-year horizon and is reviewed quarterly to ensure sufficient liquidity, capital and funding capacity under both normal and stressed environments; a contingency funding plan that identifies risk drivers, key metrics and escalation protocols and pre-funds projected cash and collateral needs while maintaining secondary liquidity sources; extensive scenario and stress testing—incorporating both firm-designed and supervisory severely adverse scenarios—across short- and long-term horizons to inform capital and liquidity adequacy and risk mitigation strategies; a conservative liquidity framework centered on unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash (our “global core liquid assets”) sufficient to meet near-term outflows in a crisis; diversified secured and unsecured funding tenors aligned with asset liquidity profiles; and risk limits, thresholds and delegated governance to enable timely escalation and decision-making.  Business continuity and operational resilience are overseen by a central team, with policies, protocols and infrastructure to support remote work, safe office re-entry, third-party vendor continuity and cyber-security protections, while a formalized operational risk and control self-assessment process and a three-line-of-defense structure ensure ongoing identification, review and remediation of process, people, technology and external event risks.  Capital planning and stress testing are integrated with liquidity management under a firmwide enterprise risk management framework, and recovery and resolution planning models define loss-absorbing capacity and triggers for action, with senior management and board committees charged with monitoring and approving policies, limits and strategic resilience initiatives across the firm.

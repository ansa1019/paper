Nee’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis describes a range of measures and disclosures that together reflect the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions and the ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning in the face of internal or external disturbances. FPL’s decision to record hurricane Dorian, Isaias and Eta storm restoration costs as operating expenses rather than recover them through a customer surcharge, and to use reserve amortization under its 2016 rate agreement to achieve a targeted regulatory return on equity, illustrates operational flexibility, emergency management and risk mitigation. Both Nee and its subsidiaries employ commodity hedging—including non-qualifying hedges, deferred fair-value adjustments through cost-recovery clauses and active value-at-risk monitoring—to mitigate fuel and power price volatility, while interest rate swaps and a balanced mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt manage exposure to changes in borrowing costs. Credit exposure is managed through formal policies, credit limits, letters of credit, collateral postings and master netting agreements. Liquidity strategies encompass diversified funding sources—cash flows, syndicated and bilateral revolving credit facilities, debt and equity issuances, asset sales and differential membership investments—designed to ensure business continuity, support resource deployment and maintain investment-grade credit ratings and covenant compliance. Pandemic preparedness and mitigation steps under COVID-19 demonstrate crisis response and organizational health planning. Regulatory accounting for nuclear decommissioning and plant dismantlement obligations, and the accrual and funding of asset retirement costs over the useful life of assets, reflect a systemic perspective and the preservation of system integrity over future trajectories. Strategic adaptation and reconfiguration of Nee’s and NEER’s asset portfolios are evidenced by the addition of thousands of megawatts of wind and solar capacity, battery storage projects, repowering initiatives, the sale of Spanish solar facilities and the acquisition of transmission assets such as Trans Bay and GridLiance, highlighting resilience strategies involving innovation, resource reconfiguration and inter-organizational collaboration. Pension funding practices, based on actuarial assumptions for discount rates, compensation increases and expected returns, underscore the use of internal knowledge and financial resources to sustain long-term obligations. Capital support guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications provided by Nee subsidiaries to facilitate power generation and pipeline projects further illustrate organizational capabilities in resource allocation, risk assessment and strategic response mechanisms that enable continued performance under pressure.

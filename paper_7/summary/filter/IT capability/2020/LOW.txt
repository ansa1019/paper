In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company leveraged its retail fundamentals strategy—emphasizing merchandising excellence, supply chain transformation, operational efficiency, and customer engagement—to rapidly roll out curbside pickup, mobile check-in, an internal order-picking application, and touchless BOPIS lockers, re-platform Lowe’s.com to the cloud to improve site stability and support triple-digit online sales growth, and invest approximately $260 million in a U.S. store reset to enhance personalization and speed of customer service. The company further invested nearly $1.3 billion in associate support, safety protocols, and community relief, including discretionary bonuses, temporary wage increases, emergency paid leave, and pandemic grants, as part of its commitment to protect health, support financial security, and maintain continuity of operations under exceptional conditions. Looking forward, the introduction of a total home strategy—modernizing installation services, expanding online capabilities, improving localization, and elevating product assortments—and the launch of a new pro CRM tool underscore ongoing strategic adaptation and future orientation. Strong cash flows from operating activities, supplemented by the issuance of $8.0 billion of unsecured notes, access to $3.0 billion of committed revolving credit facilities, and a commercial paper program, provided robust liquidity to fund $1.8 billion of capital expenditures, dividends of $1.7 billion, and $5.0 billion of share repurchases, thereby preserving financial flexibility, mitigating funding risk, and supporting performance maintenance under dynamic market pressures. Inventory and self-insurance reserves are managed through systematic estimates of obsolescence, shrinkage, and claims exposure to safeguard asset integrity and firm performance in the face of internal or external disturbances, and the maintenance of investment-grade debt ratings ensures ongoing access to cost-effective capital markets.

We invest in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines through internal research efforts and by accessing external innovation via business development transactions, thereby augmenting our pipeline, diversifying capabilities and reconfiguring resources to respond effectively to evolving patient needs and environmental disruptions. We closely monitor the results of our discovery, research, clinical trials and nonclinical studies and frequently evaluate our drug development programs in light of new data and commercial insights, with the objective of balancing risk and potential, which can result in rapid changes in focus and priorities. Our corporate compliance program is designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through compliance policies and systems and the promotion of a culture of compliance across multiple jurisdictions. During the COVID-19 global pandemic, which has not affected our supply chain or the demand for our medicines, we believe that we will be able to continue to supply all of our approved medicines to patients globally and have adjusted our business operations by having a majority of our employees work remotely, monitoring local COVID-19 trends and government guidance for each site, utilizing a phased, site-specific approach to assess employee access, limiting on-site personnel and increasing safety measures including testing, enhanced cleaning, personal protective equipment, hand sanitation stations and social distancing to maintain operational continuity. We dedicate substantial management and other resources to obtain and maintain appropriate levels of reimbursement on a country-by-country basis, including innovative arrangements that provide a pathway to access and rapid reimbursement for future medicines, thereby preserving our revenues under varying external pressures. We manage our financial resources by investing our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in instruments that meet specific credit quality standards, maintaining significant liquidity and access to credit facilities, and making strategic equity investments; we expect the value of these investments to fluctuate with market volatility, which will continue to have material impacts on our net income and profitability. We intend to rely on existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash flows from product sales as our primary source of liquidity, may borrow under revolving credit facilities and will consider additional financing opportunities to strengthen our long-term liquidity profile and fund our significant operating expenses, research and development activities, facility obligations and potential milestone and royalty payments. We structure our contractual commitments, including cancelable contracts with clinical research organizations and flexible lease arrangements for our headquarters, research sites and equipment, to maintain operational flexibility, adapt to changing development timelines and preserve our ability to respond to disruptive events while sustaining performance and preserving system integrity and organizational adaptability under challenging conditions.

Bank of America has emphasized organizational resilience through the activation of its enterprise response framework and comprehensive business continuity plans in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, invoking centralized crisis management to execute protocols and pre-planned contingency strategies, transition the majority of employees to a work-from-home posture and maintain service to clients through enhanced remote capabilities and collaboration with health authorities. The corporationâ€™s risk framework, approved by its board and supported by the enterprise risk committee and management risk committee, establishes clear roles, delegated authorities, risk appetite limits and three lines of defense for the proactive identification, measurement, monitoring and control of strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. Contingency funding and recovery plans, including a capital contingency plan, stress capital buffer, liquidity stress analysis and a single-point-of-entry resolution plan, ensure that the organization can meet expected and unexpected cash flow and collateral requirements under a range of market and economic scenarios. Through daily reviews of portfolio sensitivities and var, rigorous stress testing, global liquidity sources of cash and high-quality liquid securities, diversified funding sources and model risk controls, the corporation maintains system integrity, operational flexibility and the maintenance of performance under challenging conditions.

In response to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Abbott is continually implementing business continuity plans in the face of the pandemic and mobilized its teams across multiple fronts to develop and launch new diagnostic tests, thereby absorbing strain and preserving or improving functioning despite the presence of adversity. Due to the critical nature of its products and services, Abbott was generally exempt from governmental orders requiring businesses to cease operations, ensuring operational continuity while the majority of its office-based work was conducted remotely and strict travel restrictions were implemented. As governmental orders were lifted and later modified, the company reconfigured its operations by rotating office-based employees back to facilities on a rotational basis and continued to align its guidance with evolving restrictions. Abbott has taken aggressive steps to limit exposure and enhance the safety of facilities for its employees, demonstrating risk mitigation practices and organizational flexibility under internal and external variations. The company expanded capacity for the manufacture of COVID-19 diagnostic tests through capital expenditures to maintain its performance under extreme conditions, secured additional liquidity with a $5 billion revolving credit agreement, issued senior notes and repaid maturing debt to manage financial resources, and declared dividends while maintaining an investment-grade rating to ensure financial resilience. In addition to its pandemic response, Abbott will continue to focus on future-oriented strategic initiatives across its diagnostics, medical devices, nutritionals and established pharmaceuticals businesses, driving market adoption and geographic expansion of its Alinity diagnostics suite, expanding its market position in diabetes care, structural heart, electrophysiology and heart failure, enhancing its nutrition portfolio with science-based line extensions, and growing its depth and breadth of products in emerging markets, all of which reflect the companyâ€™s systemic perspective, resource deployment, adaptive strategies and dynamic capabilities to foresee, confront and benefit from sudden disruptive change.

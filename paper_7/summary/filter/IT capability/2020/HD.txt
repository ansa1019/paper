During fiscal 2020, the Company took a series of measures to adapt to the challenging conditions created by the COVID-19 pandemic and maintain business continuity, including implementing changes to store operating hours, promoting social and physical distancing, limiting customer density through modified merchandising events and a more localized approach to customer limits, rolling out curbside pickup, shifting store support operations to remote or virtual environments, and requiring masks for all associates and customers. These adaptations, together with strategic investments in our stores, interconnected and digital assets, supply chain and merchandising organization, enabled real-time adjustments to product assortments through cross-functional collaboration with suppliers, mitigating supply chain disruptions and preserving high in-stock levels despite significant increases in customer demand. We also strengthened organizational health and capacity by investing in expanded hourly associate pay and benefits— including additional paid time off and a temporary weekly bonus program—and subsequently implementing approximately $1 billion of annualized permanent compensation enhancements, resulting in approximately $2.0 billion of incremental expense in fiscal 2020. To support operational flexibility and risk mitigation, we enhanced our liquidity position by expanding our commercial paper program from $3.0 billion to $6.0 billion, establishing and renewing back-up credit facilities, issuing $8.0 billion of long-term senior notes, and maintaining $7.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents while deferring certain capital expenditures to prioritize associate and customer safety. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $5.2 billion, driven by higher net earnings and proactive working capital management— including the timing of vendor payments and elevated inventory levels to replenish stock—demonstrating our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under extreme conditions. We continue to actively monitor external pressures, may take further actions as required by authorities or in the best interests of our stakeholders, and believe our existing liquidity and dynamic capabilities position the Company to sustain performance and adapt to evolving environmental perturbations.

In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the company maintained near-full staffing and normal capacity levels while implementing health screenings, physical distancing, team separation protocols, equipment upgrades, visitor prohibitions, significant travel reductions, work-from-home mandates, thermal scanning, and mandatory mask-wearing, thereby preserving operational continuity under challenging conditions. To adapt to volatile demand, it shifted supply from markets experiencing declines—such as smartphones, consumer electronics, desktop PCs, automotive, and enterprise—to those with demand increases, including data-center infrastructure, cloud servers, notebooks, and gaming, and evaluated its supply chain by communicating with suppliers to identify and close supply gaps, adding alternative suppliers, and increasing on-hand raw-material inventory. The organization bolstered manufacturing flexibility and redundancy by adding assembly and test capacity across its captive operations and external partners and by redeploying equipment to right-size capacity and reduce underutilization costs, which are expected to decline through redeployment and capacity adjustments. It also evaluated all construction projects to enhance safety protocols, developed strategies and measures to respond to a range of potential economic scenarios—such as limitations on new hiring, business travel, and discretionary spending—and engaged with government authorities worldwide to follow mandates, regulations, industry standards, and best practices, all to safeguard employees, contractors, suppliers, customers, and communities while safely continuing operations. The company continuously evaluates alternatives for funding capital expenditures and ongoing operations, expects that cash, investments, operating cash flows, and available financing—including a $2.50 billion revolving credit facility—will be sufficient to meet requirements for at least the next twelve months, and has authorized share repurchases subject to market conditions. In further support of resilience, it periodically assesses and extends the estimated useful lives of equipment in its NAND wafer fabrication and R&D facilities—reducing depreciation expense and benefiting cost of goods sold by approximately $400 million in 2020—and invests in technology transitions and product enablement through capital expenditures estimated at $9 billion for 2021, thereby aligning resource allocation with strategic objectives and enhancing the organization’s ability to absorb strain, reconfigure operations, and preserve or improve its functioning and financial performance under internal and external variations and disturbances.

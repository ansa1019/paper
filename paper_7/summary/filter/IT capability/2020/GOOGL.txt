The Company’s Management Discussion and Analysis describes a suite of measures and capabilities that together support its maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including proactive expansion of products and services to accommodate the continuing shift from offline to online channels and multi-device modalities in order to preserve and grow its business; the use of a foreign exchange risk management program and hedging activities to mitigate currency volatility; regular evaluation and recalibration of investment plans—covering hiring, data center and office construction, information technology assets, marketing and travel spending—to adapt resource deployment in response to external disturbances; substantial R&D and capital expenditures in strategic focus areas such as advertising, cloud, machine learning and search to absorb strain and preserve performance; strategic acquisitions, equity investments and partnerships that reconfigure capabilities and broaden the service portfolio; its comprehensive response to the COVID-19 pandemic—slowing certain investments, pausing or rescheduling campaigns, shifting events to digital-only formats, assessing credit deterioration through allowances for credit losses, and taking measures to support customers, employees and communities—to ensure business continuity; continued aggressive investment in Google Cloud go-to-market capabilities and infrastructure to transform and emerge stronger; ongoing assessment of liquidity and capital structure, including sufficient cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, commercial paper programs and revolving credit facilities, to fund operations and commitments; issuance of long-term senior unsecured and sustainability bonds to secure financial resources for environmentally and socially responsible projects; and sustained share repurchases and debt management practices, all of which illustrate the company’s commitment to operational flexibility, risk mitigation, adaptation strategies and the preservation of integrity and performance despite adversity.

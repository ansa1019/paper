AMD’s ability to re-shape its product portfolio and improve its technology competitiveness through the launch of more than 40 new high-performance CPUs and GPUs—including first-generation Ryzen desktop processors, new “Polaris” and “Vega” GPU architectures, EPYC server processors and mobile APUs—demonstrates resource reallocation, innovation and operational flexibility that enabled the company to absorb strain and preserve functioning amid competitive and market pressures. Its inventory valuation process, which evaluates ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence based on projected sales outlook, historical sales levels and market conditions, exemplifies systematic risk assessment and resource management to maintain gross margin under variability. The adoption of ASU 2017-04 to simplify the goodwill impairment test, involving qualitative assessments of long-term performance prospects, share price trends, market capitalization and industry conditions, illustrates resilience strategies to monitor system integrity and performance in the face of external disturbances. Amendments to the wafer supply agreement with GlobalFoundries—including a comprehensive framework for technology collaboration at the 7 nm node, limited waivers to contract with alternate foundries and annual wafer purchase targets—reflect inter-organizational collaboration and supply-chain continuity measures to mitigate hazards and sustain operations under resource constraints. The establishment and amendment of a secured revolving credit facility to $500 million, secured by accounts receivable and inventory, underscores the company’s pursuit of financial flexibility and preparedness for adverse economic conditions. Strategic workforce realignments under the 2014 and 2015 restructuring plans and the exit from the dense server systems business represent organizational reconfiguration and simplified investment focus to better align resources with priorities and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Finally, equity joint ventures for assembly, test, mark and packaging services and licensing of intellectual property to the THATIC JV exemplify organizational practices of external knowledge integration, resource generation and capability building through collaborative networks, consistent with the multifaceted concept of resilience as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

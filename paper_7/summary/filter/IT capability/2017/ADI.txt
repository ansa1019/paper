We monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis and assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues, leading us to undertake various restructuring actions, including an early retirement offer and reduction of operating costs programs expected to yield annual savings of approximately $28.4 million and $5.0 million, respectively, which we expect will be used to make additional investments in products that we expect will drive revenue growth in the future. In connection with the acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation, we integrated approximately $1.6 billion of cash and marketable securities from Linear and remitted legacy cash held outside the United States of approximately $3.6 billion as part of our post-acquisition integration, resulting in approximately $98.2 million in net tax expense and financed the $15.8 billion purchase consideration through existing cash on hand, bridge and term loan facilities and the issuance of senior unsecured notes. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor credit exposure and diversify investments to minimize credit risk, and intend to use significant amounts of our remaining cash held outside the United States to finance obligations and current operations of our foreign businesses. We have a $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and $5.0 billion of term loans, and we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts—viewed as critical to maintain product leadership and provide innovative new product offerings—and dividend payments for at least the next twelve months. We reclassify revenue by end market as our data systems evolve, defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to certain distributors until such distributors have sold the products to their customers to mitigate uncertain price-adjustment credits and returns, and manage accounts receivable and inventory—balancing manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels—to support continuous product supply. Our capital expenditures are expected to be $230 million to $270 million in fiscal 2018, to be funded with cash on hand and operating cash flows, and we continue to make significant R&D investments, monitor and align financing commitments, and comply with debt covenants, thereby reinforcing our ability to absorb financial and operational strain, adapt resource deployment, and preserve integrity and performance under challenging conditions.

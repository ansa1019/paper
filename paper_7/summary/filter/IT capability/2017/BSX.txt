Boston Scientific states that “we believe our investment grade credit profile reflects the size and diversity of our product portfolio, our leading share position in several of our served markets, our strong cash flow, our solid financial fundamentals and our financial strategy,” and under its current business plan it believes “existing balance of cash and cash equivalents, future cash generated from operations, access to capital markets and existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations, invest in our infrastructure, pay our legal-related liabilities, pay taxes due, fund possible mergers and/or acquisitions and service and repay our existing debt.” The company reports that “we invest excess cash on hand in short-term financial instruments that earn market interest rates while mitigating principal risk through instrument and counterparty diversification,” holds “$188 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, comprised of $21 million invested in money market and government funds and $167 million in interest bearing and non-interest bearing bank accounts,” and maintains “full access to our $2.250 billion commercial paper program, which is backed by our 2017 revolving credit facility.” Boston Scientific notes that manufacturing cost reductions from “our process improvement programs and restructuring programs” drove a 1.9 percent increase in gross profit margin in 2017, while targeted initiatives focused on reducing SG&A resulted in SG&A expenses that were 60 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales in 2017, and research and development investments “across our businesses in order to maintain a pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growth” remained steady at 11.0 percent of net sales. As part of its strategic imperatives to drive global expansion, the company explains that “we have increased our investment in infrastructure” in emerging markets “in order to maximize opportunities,” and in integrating recent acquisitions, such as EndoChoice and Symetis, it continues to allocate resources to reconstitute and integrate operations. In managing legal and tax contingencies, management indicates that “we accrue anticipated costs of settlement, damages, losses for product liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense, based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable,” and “we establish reserves when we believe that certain [tax] positions are likely to be challenged.” The company also employs non-recourse accounts receivable factoring programs to diversify credit risk and has structured debt facilities with financial covenants and leverage exclusions for restructuring and litigation payments to preserve covenant compliance and maintain liquidity. In assessing goodwill, Boston Scientific applies a discounted cash flow method that relies on projected cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and terminal value growth rates, reflecting its use of systemic valuation techniques to measure the value of its income-producing assets. Taken together, these disclosures describe financial and operational mechanisms—cash and credit resource allocation, risk mitigation through diversification, process improvement and cost management programs, strategic infrastructure and acquisition integration, contingency reserves and covenant structures—that support the company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions.

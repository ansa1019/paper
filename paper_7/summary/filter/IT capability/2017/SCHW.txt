The Company has established an enterprise risk management framework and governance structures, including an executive‐level Global Risk Committee and supporting functional subcommittees, to identify, assess, measure, monitor and mitigate operational, compliance, credit, market and liquidity risks that could impair its ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.  Operational resilience is underpinned by formal business continuity and disaster recovery plans—comprising geographically dispersed workforce arrangements, backup facilities and communications infrastructure subject to routine testing—as well as information security controls, third‐party risk standards and ongoing control self‐assessments that keep losses within defined risk appetite thresholds.  The Company manages liquidity through comprehensive policies, diversified funding sources, consolidated and subsidiary‐level liquidity stress testing and contingency funding plans designed to ensure sufficient cash flows under both normal and stressed scenarios.  Interest‐rate risk is actively managed via net interest revenue simulation modeling that evaluates the impact of parallel rate shocks, while capital adequacy is supported by regular capital stress tests and a contingency plan for sustained capital events, consistent with internal targets that exceed regulatory minimums.  Across these dimensions, the Company’s approach to risk management reflects the maintenance of system integrity and performance—absorbing strain from external disturbances, reallocating resources, reconfiguring balance sheet parameters and preserving operational continuity—to sustain competitive advantage and financial health in volatile markets.

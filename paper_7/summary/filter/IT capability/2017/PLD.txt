During 2017, management executed strategic initiatives designed to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, repositioning the portfolio and streamlining co-investment ventures through the disposition of non-strategic properties and contributions of assets to unconsolidated entities, generating $4.5 billion of proceeds and $1.2 billion of realized gains, thereby absorbing market strain and preserving operational performance. Operating fundamentals remained strong with 97.2 % occupancy and rent rate growth under sustained capital deployment across development and stabilization activities, illustrating the system’s ability to maintain integrity and performance amid environmental variations. The company enhanced its resilience through liquidity management and funding flexibility, amending a Japanese yen revolving credit facility, increasing capacity to ¥ 50 billion, and issuing £ 500 million of senior notes at a 2.3 % rate to redeem higher-coupon debt, reflecting proactive risk mitigation and resource reconfiguration. Segment reporting and cost allocations based on relative portfolio square footage, together with reconciliation of non-GAAP measures such as net operating income by segment and funds from operations, provide a systemic perspective on core operations and support informed resource allocation decisions. Strategic capital revenues—comprising recurring and transactional fees and promoted interests from co-investment ventures—underscore inter-organizational collaboration and the generation of financial resources that strengthen organizational health and operational flexibility. Evaluating results on an owned and managed basis, inclusive of equity contributions, distributions from unconsolidated ventures, and joint venture acquisitions, further demonstrates the organization’s capacity to adapt and reconstitute its capital structure for future resilience. Diligent liquidity and capital resource management maintained compliance with debt covenants, sustained investment-grade credit ratings, and preserved $3.1 billion of available borrowing capacity, evidencing the firm’s ability to absorb financial pressures, maintain continuity, and support ongoing strategic development while balancing reit distribution requirements with retention of cash for reinvestment.

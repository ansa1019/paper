Our annual report discloses a range of processes and resource allocations designed to absorb strain, preserve integrity and maintain performance under evolving internal and external pressures. We continually evaluate our critical accounting policies—revenue recognition, inventory provisions, deferred tax assets and contingencies—using historical experience and reasonable assumptions to mitigate uncertainties. As a fabless semiconductor company, we commit to inventory purchases based on demand forecasts while adjusting to suppliers’ lead times, competitive pricing actions, product transitions and macroeconomic conditions. We maintain liquidity through cash, cash equivalents and highly rated, diversified marketable securities managed under strict duration limits, and we have a $575 million revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program available for general corporate purposes. The enactment of the one-time transition tax resulting from U.S. tax reform was provisionally estimated at $401 million payable in eight annual installments, after which substantially all non-U.S. cash became available for U.S. operations without additional tax cost. We returned $1.25 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends for fiscal 2018 and plan a similar return for fiscal 2019, reflecting strategic deployment of financial resources. Operating cash flow grew to $3.50 billion in fiscal 2018, driven by higher net income and working capital improvements, supporting projected capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. Annual goodwill impairment tests of our GPU and Tegra processor reporting units and periodic other-than-temporary impairment reviews of available-for-sale investments have confirmed that fair values significantly exceed carrying values, evidencing preserved asset integrity. We continue to invest in growth initiatives in gaming, AI and autonomous driving while remaining in compliance with debt covenants and preserving unused borrowing capacity for contingencies. Collectively, these strategies and practices reflect our operational flexibility, risk-mitigation mechanisms and capacity to maintain business continuity and performance amidst dynamic and potentially disruptive market conditions.

KKR’s annual report emphasizes that “global and regional economic conditions…have a substantial impact on our financial condition and results of operations,” and identifies “political uncertainty…regulatory changes…increased volatility…and technological advancements…that may disrupt marketplaces” as external pressures to which it must adapt. The firm observes that “periods of volatility and dislocation in the capital markets present substantial risks, but also can present us with opportunities to invest at reduced valuations that position us for future growth and investment returns,” illustrating its long-term investment horizon and operational flexibility in unpredictable markets. Management acknowledges that “challenging market and economic conditions may adversely affect our ability to exit and realize value from our investments” and that its “ability to attract new capital and investors,” “successfully deploy capital” and “raise, service and refinance debt” depends on sustaining competitive advantage amid adverse conditions. To maintain business continuity and resource allocation, KKR manages liquidity by focusing on operating cash flows, realizations of carried interest, interest and dividend income and proceeds from equity sales, and by securing funding through revolving credit facilities, senior notes and capital markets underwriting and syndication. The report further details commitments to seed new strategies, warehouse investments pending capital calls, “fund cash operating expenses and contingencies,” make distributions under the partnership agreement and repurchase its common units, while also disclosing contingent liabilities—such as clawback provisions, indemnities and obligations under its tax receivable agreement—that collectively serve as risk-mitigation mechanisms and buffers to preserve functioning and enable adaptation under disruptive events.

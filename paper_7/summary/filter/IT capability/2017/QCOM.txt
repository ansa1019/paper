Qualcomm’s disclosures describe a multifaceted approach to sustaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions through the investment of significant resources in research and development of 4G OFDMA- and 5G-based technologies, OFDM-based WLAN, baseband chips, RF front-end, connectivity, power management and related software, and through diversification into adjacent industry segments such as automotive, IoT and networking to extend product demand and generate licensing opportunities. Under its strategic realignment plan, substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2016, the company executed cost-reduction initiatives, restructuring and integration actions—particularly in connection with the formation of RF360 Holdings and the proposed acquisition of NXP—to optimize resource allocation, reconfigure organizational structure and enhance operational flexibility. In response to external pressures—including regulatory investigations and fines imposed by the Korea Fair Trade Commission and Taiwan Fair Trade Commission, disputes and arbitration with Apple, BlackBerry and other licensees, and competitive disruptions such as dual sourcing of modems—Qualcomm has deployed legal, financial and operational resources to mitigate risk, maintain business continuity, preserve working capital and safeguard liquidity, including collateralizing letters of credit, issuing $11.0 billion of unsecured notes, securing committed financing and maintaining diversified cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The company’s management emphasizes its systemic resilience by balancing seasonal fluctuations across its QCT semiconductor and QTL licensing segments, preserving its gross margin under varying product mixes, sustaining substantial R&D and capital expenditures, pursuing strategic investments and acquisitions, and engaging proactively with market participants and regulators to absorb strain, adapt to environmental perturbations, reconfigure trajectories of response to disruptive events and emerge stronger from adversity.

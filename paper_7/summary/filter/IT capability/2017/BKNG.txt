The company describes a broad set of practices and investments designed to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including continuous innovation and execution by global teams to add and categorize accommodations, improve content and distribution and enhance the consumer experience across desktop and mobile platforms; strategic resource allocation to marketing, technology and personnel to drive long-term growth even under margin pressure; adaptive reconfiguration of its revenue and reservation models—such as expanding merchant transaction processing to accommodate properties that do not accept credit cards, introducing flexible payment terms and shifting revenue recognition from check-out to check-in—to preserve operational flexibility; dynamic adjustment of performance and brand advertising spend based on growth and profitability objectives and performance advertising efficiency; proactive management of seasonality and booking-window variability by revising revenue recognition policies and anticipating holiday timing impacts on quarterly results; anticipation and mitigation of external pressures and environmental disruptions—such as economic slowdowns, political uncertainties like Brexit, currency fluctuations, natural disasters and pandemics—through natural hedges (e.g., euro-denominated debt), derivative instruments, tax prepayments and accruals for potential regulatory and litigation contingencies; maintenance of ample liquidity, investments and an unused revolving credit facility to ensure business continuity and fund strategic acquisitions (including Momondo and an investment in Meituan-Dianping), debt repayment, share repurchases and ongoing capital expenditures for data centers and new headquarters construction; and ongoing risk assessment, contingency reserves and governance processes to address fragmented markets, intense competition, regulatory investigations and complex tax exposures, all of which together support the company’s ability to absorb strain, mitigate risk and preserve or improve its functioning and performance under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

During 2017, Merck activated extensive business continuity measures in response to unforeseen events, including a June cyber-attack that disrupted worldwide manufacturing, research and sales operations but from which all manufacturing sites rapidly returned to full operation while management recorded manufacturing-related variances and remediation expenses, and a September hurricane in Puerto Rico that required the local plant to resume production under alternative power and water arrangements until normal operations could be fully restored.  To mitigate supply disruptions, the company borrowed doses of Gardasil 9 from the CDC pediatric vaccine stockpile and subsequently replenished most of those doses, and more broadly has established revenue hedging, balance sheet risk management and net-investment hedging programs to protect against foreign-exchange volatility.  Merck’s long-term strategy emphasizes augmenting its portfolio and pipeline through external innovation, disciplined prioritization of research and development resources to support both near-term revenue growth and long-term growth potential, and a conservative financial profile—including high-quality investment placements, an undrawn $6 billion credit facility, regular tender and redemption of debt and a $10 billion share repurchase authorization—to preserve financial flexibility.  Regular reassessment of accruals for customer discounts, returns and contingencies, remeasurement of contingent consideration liabilities, impairment testing of long-lived assets and acquired in-process R&D, and ongoing restructuring to streamline the cost structure further illustrate the company’s systemic approach to preserving operational integrity and adapting to external pressures while maintaining product launches, strategic collaborations and capital expenditure plans under challenging conditions.

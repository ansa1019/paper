We frequently review our portfolio to ensure we have the right set of businesses to execute on our strategy, acquiring businesses when we identify a compelling strategic need or an opportunity to change industry dynamics and divesting those that are not aligned with our market, product or financial strategies, completing four acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of $384 million, net of acquired cash, while disposing of non-core assets. We continue to implement strategic initiatives including active portfolio management, enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships, improving operational effectiveness, disciplined allocation of capital and differentiating our products and services through innovation, all of which support our ability to adapt to regulatory conditions and cybersecurity scrutiny that have created a challenging operating environment. We anticipate that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information, maintain regulatory compliance and offer innovative new services in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment, and we expect to benefit from the trend toward outsourced solutions as clients seek to remain current on technology changes. We believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks necessary to be competitive are essential to justify these investments, and that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with our position as a leading provider of non-discretionary, recurring revenue-based products and services, gives us a solid foundation for growth. To maintain liquidity and support our strategic priorities, we fund our operating expenses, debt service requirements and capital expenditures with cash flow generated by operations, cash and cash equivalents of $325 million and available borrowings under our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, and our policy is to use operating cash flow primarily to fund capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions and to repay debt rather than to pay dividends. Our debt structure—including a term loan and $3.3 billion of senior notes—is managed to ensure compliance with covenants limiting consolidated indebtedness and requiring minimum interest coverage ratios, and we maintain credit ratings of baa2 and bbb with stable outlooks, which, together with operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses, positions us to absorb strain, preserve performance and emerge stronger under internal and external pressures.

Bank of America’s 2017 Form 10-K describes a comprehensive risk management framework—approved annually by the board and the enterprise risk committee—that spans strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks to support the “maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.”  The corporation aligns its strategic plan, capital plan and risk appetite statement to ensure resource allocation, business continuity and competitive advantage through regular stress forecasting and capital scenario management under adverse macroeconomic and market conditions.  Detailed contingency funding plans, including intercompany arrangements with NB Holdings and a committed credit facility, and dynamic hedging programs in both the banking book and trading portfolios illustrate its preparedness for disruptive events and capacity to preserve performance, adapt operations and emerge stronger.  A centralized approach to liquidity management, diversified funding sources, periodic validation of quantitative models and the establishment of three lines of defense—front-line units, independent risk management and corporate audit—reinforce organizational flexibility and systemic resilience.  Ongoing monitoring of limit breaches, independent oversight of capital and liquidity, and recovery planning further demonstrate the organization’s ability to reconfigure trajectories, mitigate risks, maintain integrity and sustain operational continuity through unexpected situations.

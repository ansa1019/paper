We have been successful historically in adapting our business model to external pressures—such as fluctuations in currency exchange rates and gasoline prices—by adjusting our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing penetration of private‐label items, to maintain sales growth and leverage selling, general and administrative expenses. Our philosophy of consistently providing competitive values, including periodically reducing prices to drive sales or holding prices steady despite cost increases, reflects strategic resilience and operational flexibility under challenging conditions. Rapidly changing gasoline prices, which may significantly impact near-term net sales growth and gross margin percentages, are managed through dynamic reallocation of costs and revenues, while the expansion of new warehouses—despite lower initial operating profitability and cannibalization effects—is designed to preserve long-term performance and continuity. Our integral membership format, with high renewal rates and a tiered reward structure, reinforces member loyalty and provides continuing fee revenue, underpinning the firm’s financial health and capacity to absorb strain. We emphasize cost control through compensation levels aimed at reducing employee turnover and enhancing satisfaction, thereby supporting organizational health and human capital. We maintain bank credit facilities and short-term investments, regularly evaluate liquidity, and intend to renew credit arrangements as appropriate to ensure sufficient cash flows and capital resources for warehouse expansion and capital expenditures. Management believes that cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments will meet liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future, demonstrating anticipatory and adaptive resource management. We conduct ongoing impairment reviews of long-lived assets, self-insured risk management processes, and rigorous metrics—such as lower-of-cost-or-market inventory valuation, LIFO adjustments, and estimated inventory shrinkage reconciled to physical counts—to preserve system integrity and performance. Membership fees are deferred and recognized ratably to stabilize revenue streams, while merchandise sales are recorded net of returns and estimated rewards, reflecting systematic risk mitigation. Changes in the accounting for foreign undistributed earnings in Canadian operations and subsequent repatriation without adverse tax consequences illustrate strategic reconfiguration of financial resources. Stock repurchase programs and dividend policies, including a special cash dividend funded by senior notes, are managed to optimize capital structure without undermining operational continuity. These practices collectively embody the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions and the ability to preserve or improve functioning despite internal and external variations.

Forward‐looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact, and factors that might cause such differences include those discussed under the heading “risk factors,” reflecting the company’s acknowledgment of external pressures and uncertainties. The company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months and currently anticipates the cash used for future dividends, the share repurchase program and debt repayments will come from its current domestic cash, cash generated from ongoing U.S. operating activities and from borrowings, illustrating strategic resource allocation and business continuity planning. Its marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer, requiring investments to be investment grade with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss, while the company has entered, and may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk and into foreign currency swaps to manage foreign currency risk on its notes, demonstrating proactive risk mitigation. Contractual obligations as of September 30, 2017 include $37.6 billion under noncancelable manufacturing‐related supplier arrangements, $6.1 billion of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment and obligations related to advertising, licensing, R&D, internet and telecommunications services, and $9.5 billion of future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases, evidencing supply chain resilience and operational flexibility. The company regularly reviews its investment portfolio for other‐than‐temporary impairments, evaluating the duration and extent of fair-value declines, issuer financial condition and intent or requirement to sell before recovery of amortized cost; records write-downs for inventories that become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand based on demand forecasts, product life-cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels and component cost trends; and reviews manufacturing‐related capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate unrecoverable carrying amounts, recording impairment losses when necessary. Management’s critical accounting policies and estimates require judgments and assumptions in revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation, estimation of purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes and legal and other contingencies, including recording liabilities when a loss is probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated and adjusting valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when realizability is reassessed—processes that reflect the company’s ability to anticipate, confront and adapt to internal and external variations and disturbances, absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions.

T-Mobile’s MD&A discloses several practices and responses that illustrate its capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adversity. The Company reports that “during the third and fourth quarters of 2017, our operations in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico experienced losses related to hurricanes,” and that it “continues to assess the damage of the hurricanes and work with our insurance carriers to submit claims for property damage and business interruption,” having recognized approximately $93 million in insurance recoveries for 2017 and expecting additional recoveries in future periods. It further describes the 2016 OEM smartphone recall, for which it “recorded no revenue associated with the device sales to customers and impaired the devices to their net realizable value,” and notes that the OEM “agreed to reimburse T-Mobile for direct and indirect costs associated with the recall,” resulting in an amount due from the OEM offset against losses in cost of equipment sales and selling, general and administrative expenses. In response to regulatory shifts, T-Mobile explains that it “believes current and future regulatory changes have made the Lifeline program offered by our wholesale partners uneconomical,” and thus “continues to support our wholesale partners offering the Lifeline program, but has excluded the Lifeline customers from our reported wholesale subscriber base.” Strategic adaptation is also evident in the description of its “un-carrier strategy,” introduced in 2013 “with the objective of eliminating customer pain points from the unnecessary complexity of the wireless communication industry” and sustained through successive initiatives that have driven branded customer growth and improved churn. To strengthen financial resilience and ensure continuity, the Company identifies its “principal sources of liquidity” as cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and common stock, capital leases, the sale of certain receivables, financing arrangements of vendor payables and revolving credit facilities, and states it “could seek additional sources of liquidity, including through the issuance of additional long-term debt in 2018” for spectrum acquisitions, capital expenditures and opportunistic investments. It forecasts cash purchases of property and equipment of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion in 2018—primarily for network transformation and deployment of 600 MHz spectrum licenses—and describes arrangements entered into “to sell certain EIP accounts receivable on a revolving basis as an additional source of liquidity,” having derecognized $2.7 billion of receivables under these securitizations as of December 31, 2017. Together, these disclosures reflect the organization’s ongoing pursuit of service innovation, resource reallocation, risk mitigation and strategic foresight to maintain integrity and performance amid disruptions and evolving market and regulatory conditions.

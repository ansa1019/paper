We frequently expand and improve our technology to keep up with the pace of change, providing enhancements to our tools to meet industry needs and support at each stage of the customer’s life cycle; on a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates affecting critical accounting policies—particularly revenue recognition and income taxes—and discuss these with the audit committee; our currency hedging program and interest rate swaps are used to mitigate foreign exchange and financing risks; we invest significantly in research and development, including recruiting and hiring software developers, to support timely development of new and enhanced offerings; we utilize a direct sales force alongside an extensive ecosystem of partners—marketing agencies, systems integrators and independent software vendors—to broaden our routes to market; we believe our cash, cash equivalents and investments, anticipated operating cash flows and available credit facility will be sufficient to meet working capital and operating expenditure requirements for the next twelve months; we regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes from income tax examinations and maintain reserves for adjustments; we enter into structured stock repurchase agreements only when expected discounts exceed our estimated foregone returns; and subsequent to our balance sheet date we will remeasure deferred tax assets and liabilities, reclassify certain deferred tax liabilities to long-term income taxes payable over eight years, and anticipate a one-time provision charge in response to enacted tax reform.

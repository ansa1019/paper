Throughout 2017 Amgen undertook multifaceted transformation and process improvement initiatives to build an agile, efficient operating model that reallocates resources toward innovative pipeline development and external early‐stage innovation while sustaining a reliable, compliant supply of medicines worldwide even under extreme conditions. The company invested in next‐generation biomanufacturing to dramatically reduce scale and cost yet maintain performance integrity and continuity of operations, exemplified by its uninterrupted resumption of full manufacturing at its Puerto Rico site following Hurricane Maria. Financial resilience was enhanced by forward‐looking capital allocation strategies, including unlocking $41.7 billion in global liquidity under the 2017 Tax Act, disciplined debt management and hedging programs to mitigate foreign exchange variability and interest‐rate risk, and expansion of transformative savings initiatives alongside strategic dividend increases and share repurchase programs. Risk assessment, regulatory scrutiny and competitive pressures are managed through robust R&D resource deployment, flexible restructuring plans, contingent consideration evaluations, and rigorous impairment testing of long‐lived assets and in-process R&D projects, while accrual methodologies for sales deductions and tax contingencies demonstrate proactive adjustments to uncertain events. Governance of financing arrangements, contractual obligations and legal contingencies is structured to preserve operational flexibility and ensure business continuity, underscoring Amgen’s capacity to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning and advance its strategic priorities amid adversity and environmental perturbations.

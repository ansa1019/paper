Operating margin compression in fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by increased partner (employee) and digital investments, strategic restructuring and impairment charges and the absence of the 53rd week, partially offset by sales leverage, reflecting the company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve performance under adverse conditions. Starbucks recorded $153.5 million of restructuring and impairment charges related to strategic changes in its Teavana business—including partial goodwill and store asset impairments, early store closures and severance—and additional impairment charges in its Switzerland retail business and Canada operations, illustrating deliberate reconfiguration of resources in response to underperforming assets. In EMEA, the ongoing shift to a predominantly licensed model led to a 10% revenue decline driven by divestitures and currency headwinds, which was partially countered by incremental revenues from 339 net new licensed stores over 12 months, demonstrating operational flexibility and a systemic approach to portfolio realignment. For fiscal 2018, Starbucks expects approximately $2.0 billion of capital expenditures focused on new and existing stores, the developing Siren Retail business, and supply chain and corporate facilities, funded by $2.0 billion and $1.0 billion unsecured credit facilities, an expanded $3.0 billion commercial paper program, and the issuance of ¥85 billion of 0.372% senior notes to support sustainability projects, reflecting prudent balance‐sheet leveraging for business continuity and competitive advantage. The company also committed to acquire the remaining 50% interest in its East China joint venture for approximately $1.3 billion, financed primarily with offshore cash, underscoring strategic resource deployment to strengthen key markets. Starbucks actively manages commodity price risk through embedded pricing features and financial derivatives, hedges foreign currency exposures on intercompany royalties, inventory purchases and balance‐sheet translation, and employs interest‐rate swap agreements to mitigate variability in future financing costs. Under its market price risk management policy, the company sets risk limits that prohibit speculative activity and monitor counterparty credit risk. In assessing long‐lived assets, goodwill and indefinite‐lived intangibles, Starbucks conducts impairment tests—qualitative and quantitative—using discounted cash flow and market approaches that incorporate assumptions about revenue growth, operating expenses and discount rates, thereby preserving system integrity and facilitating positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized and evaluated for realization based on projected future taxable income and tax‐planning strategies, with unrecognized tax benefits recorded for positions not judged more likely than not to be sustained, illustrating disciplined risk assessment and governance in tax matters.

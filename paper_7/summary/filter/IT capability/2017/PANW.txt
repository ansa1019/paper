Our platform enables our end-customers to maintain the visibility and control needed to protect their valued data and critical control systems while pursuing technology initiatives, like cloud and mobility, that grow their business, providing consistent security across the network, endpoint, and cloud and reducing the total cost of ownership by simplifying security operations and infrastructure and eliminating the need for multiple, stand-alone security appliances and software products. We continue to invest in innovation and timely development of new features and products as essential to meeting the needs of our end-customers and improving our competitive position. In February 2017, we expanded our family of firewalls with new appliances across multiple form factors and performance tiers and in June 2017 announced our Palo Alto Networks Application Framework, a cloud-based SaaS consumption model enabling rapid implementation of security applications without additional product deployment. The acquisition of LightCyber in February 2017 expanded our platform functionality through behavioral analytics and laid the foundation for new subscription offerings. We believe our growth and our short-term and long-term success are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to extend technology leadership, grow our base of end-customers, expand deployment of our platform and support offerings within existing end-customers, and focus on end-customer satisfaction. To manage future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. We monitor billings, deferred revenue, and cash flow provided by operating activities as key indicators of business health, visibility, and resource sufficiency, and we believe that our cash flow from operations together with existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future. While operating expenses are expected to increase in absolute dollars and decrease over the long term as a percentage of revenue as we scale our business, we recognize that these strategic investments, along with our two-tiered indirect fulfillment model, global sales force, channel partnerships, customer support infrastructure, share repurchase program, and convertible senior notes, must be effectively managed to mitigate risks, preserve operational continuity, and sustain growth under challenging conditions.

In 2017, the railroad demonstrated the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions through a multi-faceted safety program that yielded a 3% improvement in reportable derailment incident rates and further engaged its workforce via Courage to Care, Total Safety Culture and UP Way, while simultaneously absorbing network disruptions—including the impact of Hurricane Harvey and the implementation and testing of Positive Train Control—that negatively affected average train speed and terminal dwell time. Volume growth of 2%, combined with core pricing and productivity gains, more than offset operating expense associated with a workforce reduction plan, enabling record adjusted operating income of $7.8 billion and an all-time low adjusted operating ratio of 63.0%. The company’s strategic initiatives include aligning resources with customer demand, maintaining surge capability of assets, and executing a $3.3 billion capital plan focused on renewing infrastructure, capacity expansion and technology investments—to enhance fluidity, improve detection of rail defects and increase operational flexibility in response to environmental perturbations and regulatory changes. Free cash flow generation of $2.2 billion, the availability of a $1.7 billion revolving credit facility, receivables securitization and access to commercial paper and bond markets furnish liquidity resilience, while disciplined share repurchases, sensitivity analyses of interest rates, dynamic capital allocation and continuous depreciation studies reinforce financial stability and resourcefulness. Labor agreements under the Railway Labor Act proceed without work stoppages, preserving organizational coherence, and ongoing environmental remediation, personal injury and asbestos liabilities, managed through actuarial analyses and insurance recoveries, demonstrate the firm’s capacity to absorb strain, mitigate risk and preserve or improve performance despite adversity.

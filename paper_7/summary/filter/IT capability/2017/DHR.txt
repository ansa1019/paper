Danaher’s MD&A emphasizes the company’s geographic and industry diversity and broad product, software and service portfolio as core enablers of its ability to absorb external pressures and limit the impact of any one industry or country on consolidated results, noting that its individual businesses “monitor key competitors and customers…to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future.” Management attributes the company’s long-term growth and profitability to its capacity to expand in high-growth geographies and segments, “identify, consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions,” develop “innovative and differentiated new products and services with higher gross profit margins,” expand and improve the effectiveness of its sales force, “continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality,” and “effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated global environment.” To support this positive adjustment under challenging conditions, Danaher reports significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, “to address the rapid pace of technological change” across served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, R&D and customer-facing resources, thereby enhancing operational flexibility and responsiveness. The company’s business performance disclosures further illustrate systemic resilience mechanisms, including the use of a non-GAAP core sales measure that excludes acquisitions and currency translation “to help identify underlying growth trends,” ongoing “productivity improvement initiatives” under the Danaher Business System that generate annual cost savings and fund new product development and sales and marketing growth investments, strategic restructuring actions such as the discontinuation of a molecular diagnostic product line with associated impairment and severance charges, and the acquisition of complementary businesses whose integration yields expanded capabilities and intersegment synergies. Liquidity and capital resource management likewise reflects resilience-oriented practices, with $3.5 billion of operating cash flow in 2017, targeted capital expenditures of approximately $700 million, maintenance of $630 million of cash and equivalents (including $593 million held outside the U.S.) and access to commercial paper and committed credit facilities to meet working capital, acquisition, debt service, dividend and pension funding requirements. Financial risk management disclosures describe the company’s approach to interest rate, currency, credit and equity price risk, including hedging its net investments in foreign operations and maintaining high-quality counterparties, while contractual obligation schedules and off-balance‐sheet arrangements set forth the means by which Danaher ensures its ability to adapt, reconfigure resources, and preserve functioning and performance under evolving economic, regulatory and operational conditions.

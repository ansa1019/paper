Philip Morris International Inc. describes its organizational resilience as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, aiming to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite regulatory, market or currency disturbances. The company is building its future on smoke-free products that, through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation, are designed to meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements and ultimately replace cigarettes. To support its transformation toward a smoke-free future and enhance operational flexibility, effective January 1, 2018, the company reconfigured its reporting structure from four to six segments, providing greater focus on both combustible and reduced-risk products. Its net revenues and operating income are exposed to internal and external variations—including changes in product volume and mix, pricing, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates—that have impacted profitability across its primary revenue markets and local cost bases. In response to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the company recognized provisional charges of $1.6 billion for the transition tax and re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, yet offset the net earnings impact through corresponding changes in deferred taxes and income taxes payable, preserving operating cash flows. Looking forward, Philip Morris forecasts net revenue growth in excess of 8 percent (excluding excise taxes and currency), operating cash flow of over $9 billion and capital expenditures of approximately $1.7 billion for 2018, while acknowledging the continuing risks described in Item 1A and excluding the impact of future acquisitions, unanticipated impairments, currency volatility and further legislative developments.

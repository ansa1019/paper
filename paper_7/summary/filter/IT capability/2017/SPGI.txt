The firm is applying lean management, robotics, automation and machine learning to streamline internal workflow and deliver productivity; enhancing planning and software engineering processes to speed up the delivery of content and products; strengthening our digital infrastructure capabilities, with emphasis on workplace services and cybersecurity; and upholding our commitment to a disciplined and practical risk, control and compliance environment to support business continuity under varying external pressures. In pursuit of transformative growth opportunities, S&P Global is delivering greater customer value through deeper client and market insights, innovative solutions, stronger internal teamwork and reliable, nimble go-to-market processes, while accelerating investments and coordination in building new products and in developing new markets. The company continues to maintain a strong financial position, with cash on hand, cash flows from operations and availability under the existing credit facility expected to be sufficient to meet any additional operating and recurring cash needs into the foreseeable future, and uses its cash for ongoing investments, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends, debt repayments, capital expenditures and infrastructure investment. Portfolio reconfiguration through targeted acquisitions—such as Pira Energy Group, RigData and SNL Financial—and dispositions of non-core businesses like J.D. Power, SPSE, CMA and equity research further enhance analytical capabilities, reconstitute product offerings and preserve organizational integrity and performance under adversity. Supported by leadership development programs, skills training, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and technology talent augmentation, S&P Global fosters innovation, flexibility and agility to address customer needs and adapt system integrity, thereby demonstrating its resilience in navigating regulatory changes, environmental turbulence and disruptive market shifts.

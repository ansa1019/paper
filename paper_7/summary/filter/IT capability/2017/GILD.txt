Gilead’s 2017 MD&A underscores its capacity to maintain performance under adverse conditions by highlighting “operational excellence across our business” and by detailing a dynamic resource reallocation process, whereby “we manage our R&D expenses by identifying the R&D activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources and other considerations” and “continually review our R&D pipeline … and, as necessary, reallocate resources among the R&D portfolio that we believe will best support the future growth of our business.” The company employs risk‐mitigation tools such as “foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a percentage of our foreign currency exposure” and asserts that “our existing capital resources, supplemented by our cash flows generated from operating activities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future,” reflecting forward‐looking financial planning. Strategic initiatives, including the $11.2 billion acquisition of Kite Pharma financed through senior unsecured notes and a term loan facility, and a licensing agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool “to expand access to bic,” illustrate Gilead’s ability to reconfigure its asset base and collaborate inter‐organizationally to address shifting market demands. The company explicitly acknowledges “a number of uncertainties, including … an uncertain global macroeconomic environment; additional pricing pressures … market share and price erosion caused by the introduction of generic versions … and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates,” and details its process for estimating and accreting legal contingencies “to the extent that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable,” thereby evidencing a systemic approach to preserving organizational integrity and continuity under challenging conditions.

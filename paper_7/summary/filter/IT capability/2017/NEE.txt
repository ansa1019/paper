NEE’s disclosure highlights FPL’s rapid restoration of service to approximately 50% of affected customers within one day and to approximately 95% within seven days following Hurricane Irma, reflecting operational flexibility, business continuity and recovery under extreme conditions. FPL’s use of reserve amortization under its rate agreements to offset storm restoration costs—and its plan to replenish those reserves through tax savings—demonstrates strategic resource allocation and risk‐mitigation mechanisms. Ongoing investments in plant in service, transmission and distribution additions, high-efficiency turbine replacements, solar generation expansions and the modernized Port Everglades clean energy center under the 2016 rate agreement illustrate proactive capital deployment, adaptability and innovation to maintain system integrity and performance. NEE and its subsidiaries’ reliance on cash flows from operations, borrowings, long-term debt and equity issuances, proceeds from differential membership investors and available liquidity of approximately $9.2 billion supported by committed credit facilities underscores resilience strategies for preserving liquidity and continuity. Comprehensive derivative hedging programs manage exposure to fuel, power, interest rate and foreign currency volatility, while guarantees, letters of credit and master netting agreements mitigate counterparty credit risk, evidencing structured enterprise risk management. Special use funds restricted for storm recovery and nuclear decommissioning, coupled with regulatory assets and liabilities established for recoverable expenditures, further secure long-term operational continuity. Maintenance of investment-grade credit ratings and compliance with debt covenants support access to capital markets, enabling the organization to absorb internal and external pressures, safeguard financial flexibility and pursue strategic initiatives without compromising required returns. Continuous reassessment of capital commitments, decommissioning obligations and regulatory accounting treatment reflects an ongoing adjustment process designed to preserve performance under changing environmental and market conditions.

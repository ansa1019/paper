PepsiCo’s “performance with purpose” strategy embeds long-term sustainable growth with a systematic focus on adaptability and positive adjustment under challenging conditions by addressing macroeconomic and political volatility, shifting consumer preferences, retail-landscape disruption and the emergence of niche competitors through leveraging our distribution strength, strengthening retail and foodservice relationships, reducing our environmental footprint to streamline costs, investing in talent and expanding e-commerce and digital solutions. We continuously monitor unstable economic, political and social environments, civil unrest, natural disasters, debt and credit issues and currency fluctuations in the jurisdictions in which we operate and identify and implement actions to mitigate any unfavorable impacts on business continuity and future results, as evidenced by the limited impact of the 2017 hurricanes and earthquakes on consolidated financials. Our integrated risk management framework, overseen by the board and its committees and executed through a cross-functional senior management risk committee and divisional and country risk subcommittees supported by our risk management office, is designed to identify, assess, prioritize, manage, monitor and communicate strategic, financial, operational, compliance, safety, reputational and other risks across the company in order to preserve system integrity and organizational performance. To further enhance operational flexibility and resilience, we carry out multi-year productivity and efficiency initiatives—including manufacturing automation, global manufacturing footprint optimization, go-to-market re-engineering, shared-services expansion and simplified organizational structures—supplemented by productivity savings, targeted pricing actions, mix management, and hedging strategies for commodity prices, foreign exchange and interest rates.

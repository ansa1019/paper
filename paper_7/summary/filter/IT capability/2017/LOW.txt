During fiscal 2017, Lowe’s focused on strengthening its organizational resilience by investing in capabilities to support DIY, DIFM and PRO customers and expanding its home improvement reach, advancing customer service through omni-channel assets, leveraging investments in lowes.com to provide an upgraded online shopping experience and in-home project specialists as a differentiated capability for capturing project demand, and deepening its PRO relationship through enhanced inventory breadth and a dedicated lowesforpros.com platform. The acquisitions of Maintenance Supply Headquarters and Central Wholesalers, Inc. and the integration of RONA—including the rollout of appliances to approximately 100 locations, optimization of shared supplier relationships and procurement, and conversion of select RONA stores to Lowe’s-branded formats—are expected to improve and expand the company’s ability to serve new markets and preserve functioning under shifting competitive pressures. To ensure greater success, the company is actively improving conversion, gross margin and inventory management, transforming its supply chain, empowering associates via training programs and the re-engineering of key processes such as in-store pickup and centralized project quoting. Looking to 2018, Lowe’s intends to deploy incremental cash flow from corporate tax reform to accelerate strategic priorities in six areas—leveraging analytics to know the customer and their homes better, enhancing marketing and associate engagement through user-friendly interfaces, expanding fulfillment options via a new direct fulfillment center and increased delivery capacity, delivering compelling product experiences through strategic brands and differentiated store formats, improving the PRO experience to grow specialty-trade relevance, and offering differentiated DIFM project solutions—thereby maintaining performance and partial integrity under both nominal and exceptional conditions. Financial resilience is supported by operating cash flows of approximately $5.1 billion, a $1.75 billion revolving credit facility and commercial paper program to support seasonal inventory build, access to capital markets evidenced by $2.97 billion of unsecured note issuances, a share repurchase program with $6.9 billion of remaining authorization, a 37 percent dividend payout ratio, self-insurance reserves covering workers’ compensation, liability and extended protection plans, and a comprehensive review of contractual obligations and capital resources to ensure continuity of operations and resource availability in the face of internal or external disturbances.

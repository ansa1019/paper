In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, three hurricanes impacted our operations in the continental U.S., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, contributing approximately $662 million to net sales at a gross profit below the company average and giving rise to $170 million of hurricane-related expenses, demonstrating the company’s capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adverse external disturbances. Expense leverage from positive comparable sales and stringent expense control reduced SG&A as a percentage of net sales, illustrating operational flexibility and resource reallocation to sustain performance. Net cash provided by operating activities rose by $2.2 billion in fiscal 2017, driven by higher comparable sales and expense leverage, while working capital management, influenced by seasonality, inventory control, vendor terms, and foreign exchange, highlights adaptive resource deployment. At January 28, 2018, the company held $3.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents (with $3.2 billion held by foreign subsidiaries) and maintained access to $3 billion of commercial paper borrowing capacity supported by bank credit facilities, a five-year $2 billion credit agreement expiring in December 2022, and a 364-day $1 billion facility maturing in December 2018, all in compliance with covenants—underscoring proactive liquidity management and risk mitigation. Derivative instruments are used to manage exposures to foreign-currency fluctuations and interest-rate changes, further evidencing systematic risk control. Capital and operating leases finance a portion of our stores, distribution centers, and support centers, reinforcing operational continuity. Share repurchase programs totaling $15 billion, authorized in February 2017 and replaced in December 2017, along with dividend payouts funded by $12.0 billion of operating cash flow, $3.0 billion of long-term debt, and net short-term borrowings, exemplify strategic resource allocation to maintain financial resilience and shareholder returns. Quarterly impairment evaluations of long-lived assets, at the individual store level, compare undiscounted cash-flow projections against carrying values and employ fair-value estimates (including market appraisals and sublease income potential), ensuring the preservation or improvement of asset integrity under changing conditions. Self-insurance liabilities for general liability, workers’ compensation, and medical claims are established based on historical experience and actuarial estimates, providing for potential hazards. Revenue recognition and vendor allowance policies—estimating sales returns, deferring unearned revenue, and accruing volume rebates and co-op advertising—demonstrate careful management of performance metrics and supplier relationships. Taken together, these measures reflect the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions and the organization’s ability to preserve or improve functioning despite internal and external pressures.

Our operations have benefited from network investments and portfolio initiatives designed to preserve and enhance service continuity under internal and external pressures, and we continually adjust our integrated air and ground networks to better match higher volume levels, deploying technology to increase package sorting and delivery productivity. In 2017 we expanded Saturday operations to cover approximately 50 percent of the U.S. population and introduced targeted peak charges during significant volume surges to mitigate capacity constraints and offset incremental costs from natural disasters and facility construction. We supplement GAAP results with non-GAAP metrics for management’s internal resource allocation, business unit performance analysis and incentive compensation decisions, thereby strengthening our strategic foresight and competitive advantage. Our fuel surcharge methodology was revised to weekly resets with a two-week lag to align more closely with market volatility, reducing exposure to fuel price fluctuations. Capital expenditures of $5.2 billion supported facility automation, capacity expansion, information technology enhancements and contract deposits for new Boeing 747-8F and 767 cargo aircraft to ensure operational flexibility and continuity in nominal and extreme conditions, and we anticipate $6.5–$7.0 billion of such investment in 2018 to further modernize our network. We believe funds from operations, cash, marketable securities and committed borrowing capacity adequately support our contractual obligations, strategic initiatives and business continuity, even as we record provisional estimates for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, transition tax and indefinite reinvestment assertions to enable future investment. We recognize actuarial gains and losses outside a defined corridor to maintain integrity of our pension and postretirement plans under market disturbances and establish self-insurance reserves based on historical loss experience to absorb strain from workers’ compensation, auto liability and health and welfare claims. We routinely assess market conditions, regulatory developments, impairment indicators and uncertain tax positions to adapt our projections and estimates, thereby maintaining positive adjustment and preserving or improving organizational performance under challenging conditions.

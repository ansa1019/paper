Throughout the 2015 Management’s Discussion and Analysis, the company underscores its ability to absorb strain and maintain performance under challenging conditions through a sustained focus on safety, continuous improvement and resource alignment, employing multi-faceted safety programs—Courage to Care, Total Safety Culture and UP Way—leveraging technology, risk assessment, quality control, training, employee engagement and targeted capital investments to reduce incidents and further engage the workforce; notably, average train speed improved 6 percent and terminal dwell time decreased 3 percent reflecting enhanced network fluidity amid lower volumes, and 2016 operational planning emphasizes aligning resources with customer demand, improving network performance, maintaining surge capability and migrating best practices for defect detection, crossing improvements and public education. Financially, the company reports record-low operating ratios driven by core pricing gains, lower fuel prices, resource realignments, network efficiencies and productivity initiatives that more than offset declining volumes and inflation, and outlines resilient funding sources—cash flows from operations, receivables securitization, a $1.7 billion revolving credit facility, commercial paper, bank loans and bond issuances—while managing interest-rate and fuel-price fluctuations through derivative instruments. Capital plans allocate 55–60 percent of the approximately $3.75 billion 2016 investment to renew and improve existing track infrastructure for safe and fluid operations, expand capacity through facility and track improvements, deploy positive train control systems and acquire locomotives and freight cars to enhance long-term operational continuity and growth. The report also details risk mitigation processes for personal injury, asbestos and environmental liabilities—performing actuarial and environmental assessments and accruing remediation costs—as well as stable industrial relations under the Railway Labor Act, reflecting a systemic perspective on maintaining organizational integrity, performance maintenance under adversity, adaptability to external perturbations and the strategic utilization of resources to sustain and strengthen the franchise.

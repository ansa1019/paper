The Company has implemented a series of strategic initiatives—active portfolio management of its businesses, disciplined capital allocation, operational effectiveness improvements and service innovation—to preserve and enhance its performance amid challenging regulatory and competitive conditions, including evolving digital channels and heightened requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act. Management anticipates that financial institutions will continue to allocate significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information and offer innovative services, and expects to benefit from their shift from in-house technology to outsourced solutions, leveraging economies of scale in infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks to maintain competitive advantage and operational flexibility. Recurring account- and transaction-based revenue under long-term contracts with high renewal rates provides operating leverage and supports continuity of operations, while liquidity management—using operating cash flow, cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under a revolving credit facility to fund normal operating expenses, debt service and capital expenditures—reinforces financial resilience. Amendments to revolving credit and term loan agreements extending maturities and releasing subsidiary guarantors, proactive refinancing and early extinguishment of senior notes, and structured debt issuances demonstrate risk mitigation, resource reconfiguration and reconstitution of financing structures. Divestitures of non-core businesses and targeted acquisitions, including the 2013 acquisition of Open Solutions and the planned purchase of community financial services assets, reflect deliberate reconfiguration of capabilities to absorb strain and improve functioning. Share repurchases and disciplined working capital management underpin financial strength, while integration of data center and real estate consolidation initiatives and periodic goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessments illustrate maintenance of system integrity and preparedness for potential disruptions.

T-Mobile’s management discussion describes a series of strategic and operational measures that collectively demonstrate the company’s ability to absorb strain and maintain or improve functioning under challenging conditions: since introducing its un-carrier proposition in 2013 to eliminate customer pain points, the company has driven strong customer growth and materially improved retention through ongoing network improvements; it has substantially completed the upgrade to a nationwide LTE network and is building out its 700 MHz A-Block spectrum to maintain service continuity and enhance competitive positioning; it has realized cost synergies and operational flexibility by decommissioning the MetroPCS CDMA network and redundant cell sites following the 2013 business combination; it has introduced the Jump! On Demand leasing program, reconfiguring device financing and depreciation to preserve cash flows and support service innovation; it has structured master lease agreements for network equipment, revolving receivable sales arrangements and opportunistic spectrum license acquisitions to ensure liquidity, resource allocation and rapid adaptation to evolving market and regulatory pressures; and it has invested approximately $4.5 billion annually in capital expenditures to reinforce network integrity and capacity, all of which enable T-Mobile to absorb internal and external variations, respond effectively to environmental disruptions and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

Management conducts its operations through four geographic segments and, in the fourth quarter of 2015, transferred management of its operations in Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Slovenia from its EEMA segment to its European Union segment “to further align with the member state composition of the European Union,” reflecting an adaptive reorganization in response to changing external conditions. As a holding company, our principal sources of funds to meet debt obligations “are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries,” underscoring the importance of ensuring business continuity and financial flexibility. During 2015, we recorded pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs of $68 million “related to severance costs for the organizational restructuring in the European Union segment,” following $535 million in similar charges in 2014 “related to the factory closures in the Netherlands, Australia and Canada and the restructuring of the U.S. leaf purchasing model,” demonstrating resource reconfiguration and organizational change processes undertaken to preserve or improve functioning under adverse conditions. Currency fluctuations, notably the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against key currencies, “impacted our profitability across our primary revenue markets and local currency cost bases,” highlighting exposure to external pressures and the need for risk mitigation strategies. Our 2016 forecast for reported diluted earnings per share at prevailing exchange rates excludes share repurchases, future acquisitions, unanticipated asset impairment and exit cost charges, currency changes and any unusual events, and is qualified by the factors described in Item 1A, Risk Factors, all of which represent continuing risks to this guidance and necessitate ongoing strategic foresight and adaptability. We define adjusted diluted EPS “as reported diluted EPS adjusted for asset impairment and exit costs, discrete tax items and unusual items,” believing this measure “represents core earnings, improves comparability and helps investors analyze business performance and trends,” an acknowledgement of the need for transparent performance maintenance under varying conditions.

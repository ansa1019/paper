Marsh & McLennan demonstrates its capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under internal and external variations by leveraging a global professional services network across more than 130 countries, offering risk management, insurance and reinsurance broking, consulting and analytical capabilities to maintain continuity and positive adjustment despite significant foreign exchange headwinds and market volatility. The company achieved underlying revenue growth of 3% in risk and insurance services and 5% in consulting, while reported operating expenses declined and operating income margins expanded, reflecting operational flexibility, resource reconfiguration through twenty-one acquisitions in 2015 (and fifteen in 2014) and the disposition of non-core businesses, including the $37 million gain from the sale of Mercer’s U.S. defined contribution recordkeeping business. It further mitigated risks and improved financial resilience by terminating its U.S. post-65 retiree medical reimbursement plan to realize a net credit of $125 million, amending and re-measuring its defined benefit pension plans in the U.S., U.K. and Ireland to manage funded status and reduce net periodic pension cost by approximately $165 million in 2016, and strengthening its capital structure through $1.9 billion of operating cash flows, maintenance of a $1.5 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility, selective debt issuances and redemptions, $1.4 billion of share repurchases and regular repatriation of foreign earnings while retaining $800 million of permanently invested non-U.S. cash for working capital and regulatory collateral. These strategic initiatives, together with the systematic evaluation of contingent liabilities, uncertain tax positions, cybersecurity enhancements and corporate transformation efforts in human resources and finance, underscore the company’s systemic resilience, adaptability to environmental disruptions and commitment to sustaining firm performance under both nominal and extreme or exceptional conditions.

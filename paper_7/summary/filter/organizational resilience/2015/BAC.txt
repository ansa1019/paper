Bank of America has established comprehensive contingency planning routines, including capital contingency planning, liquidity contingency funding plans, recovery planning and enterprise resiliency, supported by a global excess liquidity buffer of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities and cash that can be deployed quickly even under stressed market conditions. A centralized, globally coordinated funding strategy diversifies funding across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups, while proactive management of asset-liability maturities mitigates refinancing risk. The corporation regularly conducts enterprise-wide stress tests on balance sheets, earnings, capital and liquidity under baseline and severe scenarios, monitors key metrics such as time-to-required funding and potential cash outflows—including deposit withdrawals, collateral calls from credit downgrades and diminished secured financing—and aligns its risk appetite with strategic and capital plans. Credit risk management processes entail ongoing portfolio monitoring, risk rating adjustments, collateral-dependent workout options to help borrowers avoid foreclosure and selective settlement of repurchase claims to limit exposure. Operational risk is governed through defined roles for front-line units, independent risk management and corporate audit, with risk and control self-assessments, loss reporting and key risk indicators capturing internal process, people and system vulnerabilities. To manage market risks inherent in non-trading and trading activities, the corporation uses derivative instruments and securities to hedge interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, liquidity and mortgage servicing risks, and continually refines its models under the Basel III standardized and advanced approaches to ensure capital ratios remain above regulatory minimums. Strategic risk management, integrated into business and financial planning, ensures adaptive responses to regulatory, economic and competitive changes, thereby maintaining business continuity, operational flexibility and the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

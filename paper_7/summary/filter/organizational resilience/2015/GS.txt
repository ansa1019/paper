The Management’s Discussion and Analysis discloses that the firm maintains a comprehensive control framework designed to preserve performance under stress by pre-funding liquidity needs through the maintenance of global core liquid assets (i.e., unencumbered highly liquid securities and cash) to meet projected cash and collateral calls during acute one-day and 30-day liquidity scenarios, dynamically managing the size and composition of its balance sheet via quarterly balance sheet plans, scenario analyses and firm-wide contingency funding plans that identify outflows tied to unsecured and secured funding, derivatives, customer cash and other commitments, and establishes escalated decision rights and communication channels in the event of a liquidity crisis. It also describes a robust capital management process whereby the firm submits forward-looking capital plans under various stress scenarios (including regulatory CCAR and DFAST trajectories), conducts semi-annual and annual stress tests across market, credit and operational risks, and maintains capital conservation buffers and total loss-absorbing capacity estimates to ensure the capacity to absorb losses and continue operations under severe economic or market duress. Governance structures, including the Board’s Risk Committee, Firmwide Risk Committee, Finance Committee, New Activity Committee, Reputational Risk Committee and divisional risk committees, together with independent control and support functions such as Credit Risk Management, Market Risk Management, Liquidity Risk Management, Operational Risk Management and Model Risk Management, provide multi-layered oversight of risk exposures, model validations, and policy implementation to detect, escalate and remediate risk events. Further operational risk management practices include rigorous valuation controls, independent price verification, netting and collateral arrangements, and a firmwide operational risk committee that monitors internal event data and key metrics to minimize process failures and ensure business continuity. These descriptions reflect the firm’s systematic efforts to adapt its resource deployment, governance, capital and liquidity strategies, and operational processes to preserve business integrity, maintain performance under pressure, and recover from disruptive events.

During fiscal 2015, management detailed a series of actions and resource deployments undertaken to absorb strain from both internal and external pressures and to preserve or improve functioning under adversity, including the completion of a major payment security project providing enhanced encryption of payment‐card data at the point of sale, the rollout of EMV chip card technology in U.S. stores, identity protection services and increased call‐center staffing, accruals for estimated probable losses and settlements with payment networks and class actions, and reliance on network security and privacy liability insurance to limit exposure to data‐breach related losses; simultaneously, the company advanced continuous operational improvements and strategic initiatives—such as disciplined capital allocation driving productivity, the multi-year Project Sync supply-chain optimization program to reduce lead times and improve inventory turns, the phased rollout of a unified commerce platform and new district fulfillment centers to enable two-day parcel shipping for 90% of U.S. customers, expansion of BOPIS, BOSS and BODFS offerings, enhancements to mobile, digital content and online experiences, retraining of store associates and introduction of web-enabled handheld devices—to maintain positive comparable-store sales growth, support business continuity amid market fluctuations and strengthen competitive positioning; in concert with these operational measures, the company managed its financial resilience through interest‐rate swap hedges, back-up credit facilities, substantial cash flow from operations of $9.4 billion, issuance of long-term debt to fund dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and capital expenditures, and rigorous expense controls, thereby sustaining its capacity to respond, adapt and reconfigure resources in both nominal and exceptional conditions.

In connection with the anti-monopoly investigation in China, we recorded and paid a $975 million fine and agreed to implement a rectification plan that modifies certain of our business practices, including new royalty rate structures, while continuing to negotiate and, if necessary, pursue litigation to secure full reporting and compliance by licensees. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we announced a strategic realignment plan designed to improve execution, enhance financial performance and drive profitable growth, which includes right-sizing our cost structure by approximately $1.1 billion, reviewing our corporate and financial structure, reaffirming our capital return objectives, refreshing board composition, aligning executive compensation with stockholder return objectives and making disciplined investments in areas that build on our core technologies and offer attractive growth opportunities; as part of this plan we incurred $190 million of restructuring and related charges. We continue to invest significant resources in advancing 3G, 3G/4G multimode and 4G LTE technologies, OFDM-based WLAN, audio and video codecs, wireless baseband and convergence chipsets, graphics, connectivity, multimedia products, software and services, and in targeted opportunities such as connected home and IoT, automotive infotainment, networking, small cells, data centers, mobile health, wireless charging and machine learning, in order to deploy new business models and enter new industry segments. To support operational continuity and financial flexibility, we maintain $30.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities—of which $25.6 billion is held outside the United States and intended for indefinite reinvestment—have established a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in 2020, a $4.0 billion commercial paper program and issued $10.0 billion of unsecured notes maturing between 2018 and 2045, and manage purchase obligations and manufacturing capacity commitments to align inventory levels and supplier relationships with demand. Our capital return program, authorized to repurchase up to $15.0 billion of common stock and to return at least 75% of free cash flow to stockholders through repurchases and dividends, resulted in $8.1 billion of share repurchases toward our $10.0 billion commitment and $6.0 billion of dividends and additional repurchases, with $6.9 billion remaining authorized at September 27, 2015. We regularly monitor seasonality, network rollouts and flagship device launches to manage supply chain dynamics, and maintain forward-looking assessments to address competitive pressures, regulatory challenges and market volatility. We routinely evaluate our accounting estimates for marketable securities impairments, inventory valuation and goodwill and intangible assets for indicators of impairment in response to market conditions and operational performance, and we assess our exposure under legal proceedings and tax positions to mitigate financial risk and preserve our performance under pressure.

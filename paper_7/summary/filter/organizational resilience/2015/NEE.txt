Management’s discussion and analysis highlights the organization’s capacity to maintain performance and adapt under regulatory, market and operational challenges by deploying diversified and resilient strategies, including consistent investments in plant-in-service, transmission and distribution expansions, and modernization of generating assets at FPL; structured cost recovery and rate-making mechanisms that mitigate exposure to fuel price volatility and storm restoration expenses; proactive liquidity and capital management via multi-year revolving credit facilities, commercial paper programs and at-the-market equity issuances to safeguard business continuity; systematic development and reconfiguration of renewable generation and natural gas pipeline infrastructure at NEER; application of derivative hedging strategies in energy marketing and trading to absorb commodity price swings; disciplined decommissioning and asset retirement funding to preserve long-term integrity; and strategic asset sales and acquisitions, such as NEP investments and portfolio realignments, which collectively reinforce the company’s ability to absorb strain, preserve functioning, transform in response to environmental disruptions and emerge stronger from challenging situations.

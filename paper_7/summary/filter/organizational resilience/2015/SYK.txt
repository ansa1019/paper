Stryker’s operational resilience is reflected in its maintenance of separate dedicated sales forces for each principal product line “to provide focus and a high level of expertise,” its collaborative development of innovative products and services with customers, and its commitment to “internal innovation to develop products and services that improve outcomes and deliver greater cost savings and efficiencies” augmented by a disciplined capital allocation strategy prioritizing acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases. Management measures performance under external pressures—such as foreign currency fluctuations and recall-related contingencies—by supplementing GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures (including percentage sales growth in constant currency and adjusted operating income) that it uses for segment reviews, budgeting, incentive compensation and trend analysis, thereby preserving transparency and comparability of core operations. The company’s strong liquidity and access to capital markets at competitive rates, its “global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations,” and its proactive use of debt facilities and commercial paper to support operating needs and funding requirements underpin its ability to sustain operations and invest in growth even under adverse conditions. Stryker’s response to product recalls—incurring recall charges net of insurance proceeds, making $1,202 million of recall-related payments under the Rejuvenate and ABG II settlement agreement, maintaining reserves for contingencies and acknowledging that ultimate costs may differ materially—demonstrates risk mitigation and crisis management capabilities. The company’s hedging programs, including designated and non-designated forward currency exchange contracts and net investment hedges of international subsidiaries, serve to limit exposure to exchange-rate variability, while ongoing evaluation of receivables in southern Europe and adequate reserve levels illustrate proactive risk assessment. In its capital deployment, Stryker leverages operating cash flow first to fund acquisitions that complement its portfolio, then discretionary uses such as dividends and share repurchases, supplementing with debt as necessary, which evidences resourcefulness, operational flexibility and the capacity to preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions.

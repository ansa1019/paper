The company emphasizes strategies deemed essential for the long-term health of the enterprise with the objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top third of its peer group, operationalizing its operating-TSR model by defining tight linkages between business activities and the key drivers of value creation from strategic choices of global business units down to individual employees’ daily work plans. Productivity is identified as a core strength that creates flexibility to fund growth efforts, offset cost challenges and improve operating margins, and significant steps have been taken to accelerate productivity and savings across cost of goods sold, marketing expense and non-manufacturing overhead, yielding substantial benefits to operating margin. Innovation remains the company’s lifeblood, requiring each product category to maintain a full portfolio of commercial programs, product improvements and game-changing innovations while simultaneously innovating category, brand and market business models to better serve consumers and customers. A deliberate effort to focus and strengthen the business portfolio has enabled the allocation of resources to leading brands in the most attractive countries, channels and customer segments where the size of the prize and probability of winning are highest, thereby enhancing operational flexibility and competitive advantage. Operating discipline and execution continue to be viewed as fundamental capabilities and competitive advantages, supported by a multi-year productivity and cost savings plan launched in 2012 to streamline management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes, fund growth strategy and deliver approximately $3.0 billion in annual before-tax gross savings upon completion. In periods of significant macroeconomic pressures, the company maintains a disciplined approach to investing so as not to sacrifice the long-term health of its businesses to meet short-term objectives, managing capital spending through rigorous cost controls to achieve cash generation targets and regularly assessing cash needs against available sources—relying primarily on operating cash flow, preserving strong short- and long-term debt ratings and maintaining undrawn credit facilities to ensure adequate liquidity. The company manages market risks on a centralized basis by leveraging natural exposure correlation and netting, prioritizing operational hedging activities over financial market instruments, and employing forwards, swaps and other derivatives to hedge currency, interest rate and commodity price volatility. As of June 30, 2015, it deconsolidated its Venezuelan subsidiaries due to evolving currency exchange controls and restricted ability to satisfy U.S.-dollar obligations, reflecting an adaptive response to internal and external disturbances and preserving operational continuity by accounting for its investment on a cost basis going forward. These strategic initiatives, resource allocations, risk-mitigation practices and adaptive responses to unexpected developments collectively illustrate the company’s capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under adversity, aligning with the scholarly definition of organizational resilience as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

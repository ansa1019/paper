In 2015, AMD confronted a challenging business environment characterized by global macro-economic volatility—particularly in Greater China—intensified competitive pressures and reduced OEM demand ahead of the Windows 10 launch, yet “despite the challenging business environment, we made important changes to our business,” introducing a more diverse product portfolio of CPUs, GPUs and embedded SoCs “as part of our long‐term strategy to deliver great products,” thereby reconfiguring resources and enhancing adaptability. The company “took steps to simplify our business and better align resources around our priorities and business outlook” by implementing a restructuring plan that reduced global headcount by approximately 5%, outsourced certain IT services, consolidated real estate facilities and impaired legacy software licenses, realizing approximately $8 million in operational savings in 2015 and expecting $48 million in savings in 2016, actions that preserved functioning under adverse conditions. AMD further pursued inter-organizational collaboration by entering into an equity interest purchase agreement to form joint ventures for assembly, testing, marking, packing and packaging services, reflecting strategic resource deployment and service innovation. To maintain business continuity, the company held $785 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, supplemented by a secured revolving line of credit, and stated its belief that this liquidity “will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, over the next 12 months” and that it “may be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives” should additional funding be required. Throughout the year, AMD actively negotiated amendments to its wafer supply agreement with GlobalFoundries to adjust purchase commitments and pricing, recorded inventory write-downs related to lower anticipated demand for older-generation APUs and technology-node transition charges, and continuously assessed risks arising from environmental perturbations and market uncertainty, demonstrating an ongoing commitment to absorb strain and preserve or improve performance under internal and external pressures.

Danaher’s management articulates resilience through its geographic and industry diversity, which “help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results,” and through continuous monitoring of competitors and customers to gauge relative performance and future outlook.  Facing rapid technological development, evolving regulations and competitive consolidation, the company’s long-term growth and profitability depend on its ability to expand in high-growth geographies and segments, identify, consummate and integrate acquisitions, develop innovative, differentiated new products, services and software, expand and improve its sales force, reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality, and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated environment. In response to external pressures, Danaher is making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, “to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources … in order to be responsive to the company’s customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the company’s operations.”  Through its Danaher Business System and through restructuring actions, continuing productivity improvement initiatives and portfolio reconfigurations—including the integration of acquisitions such as Pall and Nobel Biocare and the planned separation into two independent, publicly traded companies—the company systematically realizes cost synergies, maintains operational flexibility and allocates resources to preserve and improve functioning under adverse conditions.  Capital expenditures, working capital management, disciplined financing via commercial paper, debt issuances and available cash balances, as well as targeted dividend and pension funding strategies, further reinforce liquidity and risk mitigation against currency translation effects, market volatility, regulatory changes and tax uncertainties.  This multifaceted framework underscores Danaher’s capacity to absorb strain, adapt its operational trajectories, reconfigure its organization and maintain performance integrity in the face of internal and external disturbances.

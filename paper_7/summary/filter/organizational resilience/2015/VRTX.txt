The Company emphasizes the maintenance of its financial strength and ability to preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions through the strategic allocation of resources across research, development and commercialization programs, the establishment of a corporate compliance program designed to proactively identify, prevent and mitigate risk, and ongoing adjustments to its discovery and development priorities as new clinical data, regulatory requirements and competitive insights emerge. Its processes for inventory capitalization, reimbursement negotiations and pricing involve periodic assessments and revisions of estimates for rebates, chargebacks, discounts and product returns, reflecting a systemic perspective on preserving operational integrity amid external pressures. To mitigate funding variability, management relies on multiple liquidity sources including product revenues, a $300 million senior secured term loan, strategic collaborations with milestone and royalty structures, equity financing under employee benefit plans and potential debt or asset transactions, while monitoring negative covenants to ensure business continuity. Forecasting of clinical trial timelines, regulatory milestones and commercial and development costs underpins its dynamic allocation of resources, enabling rapid reconfiguration of programs and abrupt changes in focus as new information becomes available, whereas long-term facility commitments and capital leases are managed through subleases and restructuring provisions to maintain organizational flexibility. The Company further articulates a framework for resilience by investing in diversified pipeline programs, leveraging precision medicine approaches to confront environmental disruptions, and projecting temporal trajectories of response toward disruptive events, thereby sustaining performance maintenance and adaptability in a volatile pharmaceutical landscape.

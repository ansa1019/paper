Our disclosures emphasize the company’s capacity to anticipate and respond to internal and external pressures and to preserve operational continuity under varying conditions. We describe rigorous risk-management programs—such as our formal water stewardship and water risk management initiatives that assess source-water availability, improve efficiency and replenish local resources in collaboration with governments and NGOs—and elaborate on our global supply-chain optimization, system-standardization and productivity-and-reinvestment programs designed to reallocate resources into consumer-facing marketing, reinforce infrastructure and drive long-term sustainable growth. We routinely evaluate the recoverability and impairment of assets—testing goodwill, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and equity interests under discounted-cash-flow and market-based models—updating assumptions on sales volumes, cost of capital, inflation, foreign exchange and tax rates to mitigate losses and maintain integrity and performance. We discuss our strategic refranchising and selective acquisition of bottling operations in underperforming markets to leverage our assets, foster local efficiencies, share best practices and ensure financial health and franchise strength. We further detail our dynamic pension-plan valuation process, hedging strategies for commodity and currency exposures, and structured tax positions—all reflecting our efforts to absorb strain, redeploy resources, preserve liquidity and emerge stronger from challenging situations.

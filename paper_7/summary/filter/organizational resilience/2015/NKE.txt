Nike’s management articulates a strategy to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, “must have” products, building deep personal consumer connections and delivering compelling consumer experiences at retail and online, underpinned by a commitment to drive operational excellence across key areas including expanding gross margin, reducing product costs and making the supply chain a competitive advantage by investing in new technologies that increase automation, reduce waste and enhance both customization and speed to market. Through execution of this strategy, fiscal 2015 results demonstrated an ability to absorb significant foreign currency headwinds and supply chain disruptions, delivering record revenues and earnings per share despite higher product input costs, labor input cost inflation and higher air freight costs incurred in part to mitigate negative impacts from west coast port congestion. We continue to expand our direct-to-consumer operations as part of an integrated marketplace growth strategy and improve working capital efficiency while deploying capital effectively, reflecting adaptability and resilience under volatile and challenging conditions. While foreign currency markets remain volatile, we remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the long-term by executing against the operational strategies outlined, managing global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to lessen the effects of currency fluctuations through natural offsets and hedging, and maintaining liquidity through existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments together with access to external sources, including committed credit facilities, sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future.

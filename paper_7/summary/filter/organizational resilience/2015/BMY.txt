Bristol-Myers Squibb’s management continuously evaluates and adjusts its capital structure to ensure efficient financing, managing short- and long-term borrowings, commercial paper programs, revolving credit facilities and marketable securities portfolios to support business development, facility investments and dividend commitments under fluctuating market and regulatory environments. The company maintains a rigorous governance framework under the SEC consent order, including formal policies and procedures to limit sales to direct customers based on estimated customer demand, comprehensive inventory monitoring in the U.S. wholesaler channel, an escalation process for compliance inquiries, the establishment of a business risk and disclosure group and engagement of an outside consultant to re-engineer accounting and financial reporting processes, thereby preserving operational continuity. Proactive liquidity and credit management actions—including factoring receivables in certain European markets, monitoring foreign currency impacts on revenues and managing exposures to government-backed entities—are employed to mitigate external economic pressures and ensure ongoing cash generation. In addition, periodic impairment reviews and accelerated depreciation for manufacturing and R&D facilities, dynamic allocations of resources for alliance and licensing transactions, disciplined pipeline portfolio balancing and ongoing scenario planning for evolving regulatory requirements further enable the organization to absorb financial and operational shocks, maintain performance and adapt to adverse or unexpected conditions.

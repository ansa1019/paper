Gilead Sciences, a research‐based biopharmaceutical company with operations in more than 30 countries, has continued to enhance its ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions by adding to its existing portfolio through internal discovery and clinical development programs and through a product acquisition and in-licensing strategy, by investing in the progression and expansion of its product pipeline, and by continually reviewing its R&D pipeline and, as necessary, reallocating resources among programs based on scientific data, probability of successful development, market potential and available human and capital resources. The company manages external pressures and preserves operational flexibility by using foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge exposure, maintaining substantial cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to satisfy foreseeable capital needs, and operating under a five-year revolving credit facility with customary covenants, none of which were in violation as of year-end. It has increased R&D expenses to support ongoing clinical study activity and geographic expansion and expects further increases in R&D and continued expansion of its clinical studies in 2016, while selling, general and administrative expenses have grown to support the build-out of its global commercial infrastructure and to sustain system integrity and performance. Gilead’s strategic deployment of resources is further demonstrated through capital return initiatives—stock repurchase programs, an accelerated share repurchase transaction and quarterly cash dividends—and through substantial capital commitments for facilities, clinical trials and purchase obligations. By acknowledging a range of uncertainties—including global macroeconomic volatility; pricing measures to reduce healthcare spending; foreign exchange fluctuations; inaccuracies in patient start estimates; competitive launches; and shifts in payer mix—and by embedding structured allowances for government and other rebates, prudent debt and covenant management, and ongoing compliance processes, the company underscores its dynamic capabilities, risk mitigation mechanisms and adaptability to preserve organizational strength and maintain performance under pressure.

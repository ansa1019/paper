Mastercard guarantees the settlement of Mastercard, Cirrus and Maestro-branded transactions between its issuers and acquirers and maintains business continuity planning, including an established $3.75 billion commercial paper program and a $3.75 billion committed unsecured revolving credit facility with maturities of up to 397 days, to provide liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures; management also attempts to manage foreign currency exposures through its foreign exchange risk management activities and monitors political, economic and regulatory conditions worldwide to identify opportunities for continued growth and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry, noting that the global nature of its business helps protect operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries while recognizing its susceptibility to U.S. economic trends due to revenue concentration; the MD&A further emphasizes resource allocation and strategic initiatives to enhance critical capabilities—such as the acquisition of data analytics firms—improved cost control initiatives that partially offset higher expenses, segmentation of significant one-time items to focus on ongoing operations, the reinvestment of foreign earnings indefinitely outside the United States and the deployment of safety and security services to prevent, detect and respond to fraud, together with reliance on cash flow, cash equivalents and investments to satisfy future operating cash needs, capital expenditures and obligations; these measures collectively support Mastercard’s ability to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity, consistent with the maintenance of performance under challenging conditions.

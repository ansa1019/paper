In our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we emphasize that there continues to be volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in certain markets, “and we continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions.” We “proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions,” including adjusting pricing and the mix of resources—through greater use of lower-cost global delivery capabilities—to mitigate labor-cost pressures and preserve margins. We also “seek to manage our costs, taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates” by using currency protection provisions in customer contracts and hedging programs. Our policies for revenue recognition and contract profitability involve continuous estimation, with revenues and costs under the percentage-of-completion method continuously monitored and revised, loss provisions recorded when total costs exceed expected revenues, contract acquisition costs expensed or deferred based on contractual terms, and deferred transition costs “protected in the event of early termination of the contract and…monitored regularly for impairment.” To support business continuity and strategic flexibility, our primary liquidity sources include “cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities,” and we believe these will be sufficient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs, thereby preserving the organization’s ability to absorb strain and maintain functioning under internal or external disturbances.

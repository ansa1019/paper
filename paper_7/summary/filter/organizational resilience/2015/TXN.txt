We design, make and sell semiconductors worldwide, constructing our business model around the industryâ€™s broadest portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing semiconductors, which enables us to solve diverse customer needs and access more customers while generating more revenue per system. We invest more than $1 billion each year to develop new products, maintain a strong foundation of manufacturing technology and low-cost production, and directly control our manufacturing capacities to ensure consistent supply and mitigate operational risks. By acquiring mature assets ahead of demand at attractive prices and producing billions of semiconductors annually on 150-, 200- and 300-millimeter wafers, we enhance our operational flexibility, preserve margin growth and strengthen cash flow over the long term. Our global sales force and industry-leading market channels provide unique access to over 100,000 customers, and our diversity and longevity in products and markets reduce dependence on any single product, application or customer while delivering high terminal value and supporting consistent growth in free cash flow and market share. We align costs with growth opportunities through ongoing restructuring actions, maintain liquidity through cash flow from operations supplemented by short-term investments and an undrawn $2 billion revolving credit facility, and manage working capital, inventory levels and purchase obligations based on historical data, market trends and contractual terms. We believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividends, debt-related payments and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months.

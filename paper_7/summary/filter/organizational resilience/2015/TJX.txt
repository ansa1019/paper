During fiscal 2016, the Company continued to generate strong cash flows, allowing it to return value to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, while reinvesting in the business by adding new stores, remodeling existing ones and strengthening infrastructure to support continuing growth; the first phase of an initiative to raise wages for U.S. full- and part-time hourly store associates was implemented, with a second phase scheduled for fiscal 2017. The improvement in the cost of sales ratio was driven by buying and occupancy expense leverage on strong same-store sales growth and an increase in merchandise margin, together benefiting the fiscal 2016 expense ratio by approximately 0.5 percentage points despite adverse transactional foreign exchange effects on merchandise costs in Canada and Europe. To mitigate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases denominated in non-local currencies, the Company routinely enters into inventory-related hedging instruments, recording a mark-to-market gain or loss at each reporting period that is effectively offset upon receipt and payment of the hedged inventory. The Company expects fiscal 2017 capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion to support growth through investments in offices, distribution centers, store renovations and new stores, to be funded through internally generated funds. Under its stock repurchase programs, the Company plans to purchase approximately $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion of stock, determining the timing and amount of repurchases based on excess cash flow, liquidity, economic and market conditions, business prospects, legal requirements and other factors, and expects to pay quarterly dividends of $0.26 per share, or $1.04 per share annually, a 24% increase over fiscal 2016. The Company believes existing cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and credit facilities are more than adequate to meet operating needs over the next fiscal year. Critical accounting policies that involve significant judgments and estimates, and that affect the Companyâ€™s ability to absorb strain and preserve performance under internal or external variations and disturbances, include inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets, retirement obligations, share-based compensation, casualty insurance, reserves for uncertain tax positions and loss contingencies.

Visa is a global payments technology company that supports fast, secure and reliable electronic payments through a global payments infrastructure and support services, facilitating global commerce in more than 200 countries and territories and adapting to the ongoing worldwide migration from paper-based to electronic forms of payment and uneven economic growth. The company regularly evaluates cash requirements for operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures and maintains treasury policies to provide adequate liquidity for operating expenditures and contingency scenarios, ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities, fund required litigation settlements through a litigation escrow account and loss-sharing agreements, make planned capital investments in technology assets and infrastructure to support digital solutions and core business initiatives, pay dividends and repurchase shares, and optimize income by investing excess cash in available-for-sale securities, supported by a $3.0 billion commercial paper program, an unsecured revolving credit facility, a universal shelf registration statement and planned senior unsecured debt issuance to fund the Visa Europe acquisition. Credit ratings of A+/P-1 (S&P) and A1/P-1 (Moody’s), a hedging program, client incentive programs to build payment volume and card acceptance, strategic pricing modifications, formal governance over pension and tax contingencies, and the amendment of the Visa Europe put option demonstrate the company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under internal and external variations, including litigation exposure, foreign currency volatility and tepid economic growth, thereby maintaining system integrity and performance under adverse conditions.

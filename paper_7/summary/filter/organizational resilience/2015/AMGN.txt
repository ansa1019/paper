Amgen’s ongoing transformation and process improvement efforts, initiated in 2014, embody a systemic perspective on resource reallocation and operational flexibility under challenging conditions by reducing geographic footprint and workforce to deliver cost savings and fund its innovative pipeline and growth opportunities within a more focused operating model. Cash flows from operating activities grew 6% to $9.1 billion in 2015, driven by higher operating income, enabling the company to continue to invest for the future while existing funds, cash generated from operations and access to financing—including marketable securities, a $2.5 billion syndicated credit facility, a commercial paper program and shelf registration for debt and equity—are deemed adequate to satisfy working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service, dividends, share repurchases and strategic transactions, thereby preserving business continuity. To mitigate financial risks and maintain performance under external pressures, Amgen employs interest rate and cross‐currency swap contracts to offset interest rate and foreign currency volatility and hedges its net foreign currency exposure, while closely monitoring global economic conditions, customer receivable trends—particularly in southern Europe—and pricing pressures from healthcare cost containment and biosimilar competition. The company’s strategic initiatives—to execute new product launches, advance a robust pipeline of innovative biologics and biosimilars, transform next‐generation manufacturing capabilities and pursue interorganizational collaborations—reflect its capacity to reconfigure trajectories, adapt to environmental perturbations and emerge stronger from disruptions. Amgen cautions that its forward‐looking statements, based on current management beliefs and assumptions, involve risks and uncertainties—including competitive product launches, regulatory scrutiny and economic variability—that could materially affect outcomes, underscoring the importance of dynamic capabilities, adaptability and resilience in safeguarding operational continuity and sustaining value creation.

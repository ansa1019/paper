PepsiCo’s annual report recognizes the importance of maintaining “organizational health” and ensuring “business continuity” under “uncertain and volatile macroeconomic conditions, including unfavorable exchange‐rate fluctuations and currency restrictions; geopolitical, economic and social instability; an increasingly competitive business environment with constantly changing consumer tastes and preferences; resource scarcity; and intensifying regulatory pressures.” To address these external pressures and preserve its functioning, the company leverages an integrated risk management framework that “identifies, assesses, prioritizes, addresses, manages, monitors and communicates” key strategic, operational, financial, compliance, safety and reputational risks through board oversight, dedicated risk committees and experienced cross-functional teams, thereby embedding risk mitigation and crisis response capabilities. PepsiCo’s “performance with purpose” strategy, which aligns human, environmental and talent sustainability priorities with long-term value creation, reflects a systemic perspective on resilience by coupling resource allocation, innovation and sustainability to organizational objectives. Through successive multi-year productivity initiatives, the company has reconfigured its global manufacturing footprint, automated processes, re-engineered go-to-market systems, expanded shared services and simplified organizational structures, demonstrating operational flexibility, resource reconfiguration and adaptation to disruptive change. Management further emphasizes its liquidity and capital resources—its “cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities and other available methods of debt financing”—as essential to meeting operating, investing and financing needs, reinforcing its financial resilience. Finally, by “upgrading our commercial capabilities,” building new e-commerce and R&D capabilities, “fostering a culture of collaboration” to develop talent and “exercising discipline with respect to capital returns,” PepsiCo highlights dynamic capabilities, absorptive capacity and organizational adaptability that enable the company to absorb strain, preserve performance and emerge stronger under challenging conditions.

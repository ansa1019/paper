Schwab maintains an enterprise risk management framework that incorporates its purpose, vision and values to form the bedrock of its risk culture, sets risk appetite approved by the Board and assigns the Global Risk Committee responsibility for the oversight of risk management, including identifying emerging risks, assessing risk management practices and the control environment, supporting resource prioritization and escalating significant issues. The company conducts regular liquidity stress testing to develop a consolidated view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure the company’s ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during market-related or company-specific liquidity stress events, and maintains a comprehensive capital contingency plan to provide action plans for certain low probability/high impact capital events. Dual data centers, backup and recovery functions and periodic testing of disaster recovery plans, together with policies, procedures and technology to protect against fraud and unauthorized access, underpin business continuity and system integrity. Operational risk is mitigated through a system of internal controls and risk management practices designed to keep operational losses at levels appropriate to the inherent risk, while compliance, legal and model governance programs, periodic risk self-assessments and internal audit reviews reinforce supervisory controls and readiness to respond to unexpected situations. Credit risk is managed by establishing and reviewing credit limits, monitoring counterparty quality and adjusting margin, PAL, option and futures requirements, while diverse funding sources—including secured credit facilities, committed and uncommitted lines, securities lending and bank deposits—support operational flexibility. Incentive compensation risk oversight, stress testing of capital and liquidity, and Board-approved target ratios for CET1 and leverage help ensure resource deployment and organizational health are preserved under internal or external variations and disturbances.

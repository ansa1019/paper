During 2015, management maintained positive adjustment under challenging conditions by reallocating resources and reconfiguring operations to absorb strain from shifting user behavior and external pressures. We continued to advance our three revenue growth priorities—capitalizing on the shift to mobile, expanding our marketer base, and enhancing ad relevance through new formats and tools—while investing strategically in core products and services, next-generation offerings such as Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, and long-term innovation initiatives including connectivity efforts, virtual reality platforms and artificial intelligence research. We responded to the disruptive shift from personal computers to mobile devices by increasing the prominence and price per ad in news feed, reducing overall ad volume but preserving revenue growth, resulting in mobile advertising representing approximately 77% of total advertising revenue for the year (80% in the fourth quarter). To ensure business continuity and operational flexibility amid user growth and new service delivery, we expanded our data center capacity and technical infrastructure—driving a 33% increase in cost of revenue—and plan capital expenditures of $4.0 to $4.5 billion in 2016. In recognition of uncertainty and risk mitigation, we record and quarterly review loss contingency reserves for litigation and uncertain tax positions, maintain an undrawn $6.5 billion revolving credit facility, and hold $18.43 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to support liquidity needs. Our business combination and goodwill impairment processes involve systematic valuation and recoverability assessments to adapt to changing market conditions, and we continuously refine our revenue recognition and tax provisioning frameworks to preserve system integrity. Investment in organizational capabilities through a 43% increase in R&D headcount, a 32% increase in marketing and sales staff, and a 36% increase in general and administrative personnel demonstrates our commitment to absorptive capacity, dynamic resource deployment and sustained performance under internal and external variations.

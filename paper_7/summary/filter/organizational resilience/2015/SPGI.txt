During 2015, the Company continued to focus on investments in targeted financial assets, divesting selected non-core assets, consolidating its real estate footprint and increasing shareholder return, thereby reallocating resources to scalable, interrelated businesses in the capital and commodity markets. It acquired SNL Financial and the Used Car Guide, explored strategic alternatives for JD Power and classified its assets held for sale, actions that support business continuity, reconfigure strategic trajectories and preserve operating flexibility. Proceeds from divestitures of McGraw Hill Construction and McGraw-Hill Education were deployed to debt reduction, selective acquisitions, investments, share repurchases and general corporate purposes to sustain integrity under market volatility. Management aligned efforts against two strategic priorities: creating growth by executing strategic initiatives, strengthening core capabilities and collaborating across businesses, and driving performance through operational excellence, risk mitigation and enhanced accountability. The vision to promote sustainable growth by providing transparent, independent benchmarks, ratings, analytics, data and research through customer-centric channels reflects a systemic perspective and future-oriented resilience. In 2016, the Company plans to enhance digital capabilities, expand fixed-income and emerging-markets offerings, penetrate core customer segments and deliver cost synergies from the SNL acquisition to bolster adaptability amid external pressures and environmental turbulence. Maintaining $1.5 billion of cash and a $1.2 billion five-year revolving credit facility underpins its capacity to deploy resources, manage regulatory and market disturbances and ensure operational continuity across fluctuating business environments.

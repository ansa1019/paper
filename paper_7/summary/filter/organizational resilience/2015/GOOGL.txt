The discussion emphasizes management’s proactive adaptation to evolving market conditions—“users’ behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves”—and the company’s ongoing expansion of its “product offerings to serve their changing needs” and “products and services to stay in front of this shift in order to maintain and grow our business” in a multi-device world. It highlights risk-mitigation measures such as “our foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations” in international markets, the strategic diversification of revenue with “the portion of our revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues is increasing,” and the commitment to fortify capabilities through “significant research and development (R&D) investments in areas of strategic focus” and acquisitions “an important part of our strategy and use of capital.” The report underscores the critical role of human capital—“our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them”—and describes organizational restructuring “in the fourth quarter of 2015, we implemented legal and operational changes in how our chief operating decision maker … manages our businesses, including resource allocation and performance assessment.” Liquidity and financial flexibility are addressed through statements that “we believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months,” supported by a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility, a commercial paper program, and board-authorized share repurchases executed “from time to time … through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions.” Finally, the report details governance around uncertainty and continuity—“we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes … to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes,” “we record a liability when we believe that a loss has been incurred,” and the periodic review and impairment testing of long-lived assets and marketable and non-marketable securities whenever “events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable” or that impairments may be “other-than-temporary.”

Boeing’s strategy emphasizes successful execution in healthy core businesses—Commercial Airplanes and Defense, Space & Security—supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital, with the substantial earnings and cash flow generated by these businesses reinvested in new products and services to absorb market cyclicality, allocate resources effectively and preserve performance despite commercial and defense pressures. BDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security, space and services to deliver capability-driven solutions at reduced costs, while Commercial Airplanes focuses on producing market-demanded products and services, finding new ways to improve efficiency and quality, and leveraging an extensive customer support network of aviation support, spare parts, training, maintenance documents and technical advice to sustain operational continuity. We regularly review program accounting quantities—comprising delivered, undelivered and anticipated units—to inform production rates, backlog and resource deployment decisions, and we record reach-forward losses immediately when estimated costs exceed revenues, thereby reconfiguring our financial trajectories toward future commitments and ensuring program integrity. Through monitoring and mitigating risks—from EMD contract design changes and geopolitical unrest in Russia/Ukraine to Export-Import Bank financing constraints—and working with customers on alternative financing, we support business continuity and supply-chain resilience. Ongoing capital expenditures and contract accounting practices, including cost-reduction efforts and mitigation plans, provide financial flexibility to respond to environmental disruptions, preserve integrity under adverse conditions and transform challenges into opportunities while pursuing additional orders and growth.

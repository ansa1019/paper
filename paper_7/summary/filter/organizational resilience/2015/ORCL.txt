Oracle’s disclosures describe a range of strategic, operational and financial measures that together support its ability to absorb strain and maintain or improve functioning under adversity.  The company emphasizes rapid deployment, maintainability and cost‐effective cloud offerings to enable shorter time to innovation and reduced integration and testing work, and engineers its products for flexibility, agility, compatibility, extensibility and seamless interoperability across on-premises and cloud environments.  Oracle’s pre-integrated and fully tested engineered systems are designed to deliver improved performance, availability, security and operational efficiency, simplify maintenance and shorten time to production, while its maintenance services, support contracts and advanced customer support preserve critical functionality and foster resilience in customers’ IT infrastructures.  Significant investments in research and development—$5.5 billion in fiscal 2015—reinforce a deep understanding of how application, platform and infrastructure components interact, drive systemic integration and accelerate innovation, and Oracle’s global blended delivery model and education services build internal knowledge and support organizational adaptation through implementation, ongoing enhancements and upgrades.  A selective acquisition program strengthens competitive position by expanding scale, reconfiguring capabilities and accelerating growth, while constant-currency reporting, disciplined working capital and cash-flow management, targeted financing activities and rigorous forecasting and impairment testing provide liquidity, risk assessment and the financial flexibility needed to preserve system integrity under external pressures.  Finally, Oracle’s continuing emphasis on hybrid IT deployment models and contract renewals ensures continuity of service and resource availability, enabling the company and its customers to respond effectively to disruptive change and emerge stronger.

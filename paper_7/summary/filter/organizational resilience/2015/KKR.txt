As a global investment firm, we recognize that global and regional economic conditions have a substantial impact on our financial condition and results of operations, influencing the values of the investments we make, our ability to exit these investments profitably and our ability to make new investments and driving our emphasis on operational flexibility and active risk mitigation across nominal, extreme and exceptional market conditions. In periods of volatility and dislocation in the capital markets, which present substantial risks, the firm also pursues opportunities to invest at reduced valuations that position us for future growth, while maintaining liquidity through diversified funding sources—including credit facilities, debt offerings and balance sheet capital—and disciplined cash management, distributions and capital commitment structures to ensure business continuity under adverse conditions. Our multi-segment platform—encompassing private markets, public markets, capital markets and principal activities—supports systemic coordination of resource allocation, fee-related earnings and carried interest, enabling adaptation to challenges such as credit spread widening, currency and commodity price volatility, changes in interest rates and competitive pressures. We actively adjust deployment strategies by managing uncalled commitments, hedging through over-the-counter derivatives and foreign currency positions and reallocating capital in response to shifting investor demands, market liquidity constraints and performance variability, thereby preserving organizational health, sustaining profitability and maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

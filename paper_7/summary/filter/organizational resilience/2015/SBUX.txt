Starbucks’ fiscal 2015 results underscore the continued strength of its global business model and its ability to successfully make disciplined investments in its business and its partners, manifested by sales leverage driving operating margin expansion, investments in store partners and digital platforms to support in-store initiatives, and improvements in sourcing and supply-chain processes to lower cost of sales and occupancy costs. The company actively manages its cash and investments to internally fund operating needs, service debt, pursue acquisitions and return cash to shareholders, maintains highly liquid available-for-sale securities, and retains a $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility (expandable by $750 million) along with a $1 billion commercial paper program, while continually evaluating liquidity and funding needs and anticipating further long-term debt issuance to preserve financial flexibility. Commodity price risk is mitigated through fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed green coffee contracts and financial derivatives, foreign currency exchange risk is hedged via derivative instruments covering intercompany royalties, inventory purchases and translation exposures, and interest rate risk is managed by forward-starting swaps hedging benchmark rate variability on anticipated debt issuances, all governed under a market price risk management policy that sets annual risk limits and prohibits speculative activity. Operationally, Starbucks expects to deploy approximately $1.4 billion in capital expenditures in fiscal 2016—primarily for new stores, store renovations, systems and technology investments—to drive revenue growth in excess of 10 percent through comparable store sales, net new store openings and digital innovation such as mobile order and pay, while leveraging revenue growth to moderate margin expansion even as it continues to invest in partners, platforms and international growth initiatives.

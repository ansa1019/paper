The company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months; it currently anticipates that cash used for future dividends, its share repurchase program and debt repayments will come from its domestic cash, cash generated from ongoing U.S. operating activities and from borrowings. Its marketable securities portfolio is invested primarily in highly‐rated, investment‐grade securities with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss, and the company regularly reviews this portfolio to determine whether any security is other‐than‐temporarily impaired by evaluating factors such as the duration and extent to which fair value is below cost, the issuer’s financial condition, and whether sale before recovery is likely. The company reviews its manufacturing‐related capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable, recording an impairment loss equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value when necessary, and it accrues for estimated cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. The company continues to believe that focused investments in research and development are critical to its future growth and competitive position and are directly related to the timely development of new and updated products central to its core business strategy. In response to competitive pressures, it expects to continue taking product pricing actions, which could adversely affect its gross margins. The company’s revenue recognition policy requires that if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is deferred until reliable estimates can be made or price protection lapses, and it records reductions to revenue for expected product returns based on historical experience. To manage financial risks, the company has issued unsecured short‐term commercial paper for general corporate purposes— including dividends and share repurchases—and has entered, and may in the future enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk and currency swaps to manage foreign currency risk on its notes. The company holds significant cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities outside the United States, which are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation, and it evaluates the realizability of deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing forecasted income, tax planning strategies and the need for any valuation allowance. The company also records liabilities for probable and reasonably estimable legal contingencies, including indemnification obligations, but believes it is not reasonably possible that these would result in a material loss.

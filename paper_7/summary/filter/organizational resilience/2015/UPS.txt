In the face of uneven global growth, weak export demand, volatile commodity prices and slowing emerging-market economies, we continuously adjusted our air capacity and cost structure to better align our transportation network with prevailing volume levels and leveraged the flexibilities inherent in our broad portfolio of product offerings to adapt to changing trends. To preserve or improve operational performance under challenging conditions, we undertook initiatives across all segments to enhance flexibility and capacity in our air and ground networks, refine yield management, and increase efficiency and cost containment through targeted technology investments—most notably facility automation projects and the accelerated deployment of our on-road integrated optimization and navigation system—which together have increased network capacity, improved reliability and contained vehicle miles driven despite higher package volumes. We have expanded and optimized operating facilities to improve time-in-transit, restrained the growth of aircraft block hours even as export volumes rose, and continued air-product service enhancements to mitigate network costs. In our supply chain and freight operations, we realigned third-party capacity procurement rates to fall faster than customer rates and drove transportation expense reductions that outpaced revenue growth. We believe that funds from operations and our borrowing programs provide adequate liquidity and capital resources to meet our long-term needs, and we have committed to vehicle, equipment and real estate investments to support anticipated growth, intending to satisfy these obligations through operating cash flows. Through the collective bargaining process, we transferred significant healthcare liabilities to multiemployer funds, securing fixed contribution rates, reducing regulatory and demographic risks and enhancing cost certainty, further reinforcing our ability to maintain positive adjustment and continuity under adverse external pressures.

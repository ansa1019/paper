Management’s discussion and analysis describes forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those set forth under “Risk Factors,” and highlights our innovative security platform designed to absorb strain under targeted cyber-attack pressures by preventing breaches in real time and providing in-depth visibility into all network traffic, user activity, and content; subscription services can be easily activated on any appliance without requiring additional hardware or processing resources, thereby providing seamless implementation and operational continuity; our hybrid SaaS revenue model, which has delivered recurring revenues and supports service innovation and resource generation, is underpinned by investments in research and development, prototype expenses, and the strengthening of our product portfolio; we continue to invest in expanding our information technology and financial infrastructure, operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes efficiently in response to growth and intense competition, which demands differentiated products and strategic agility; we monitor deferred revenue as an indicator of future resource deployment and organizational health, use cash flow from operating activities to better understand and manage our cash needs, and employ non-GAAP measures such as free cash flow and billings to assess liquidity and near-term cash flow visibility, enabling strategic opportunities including acquisitions and balance sheet strengthening; services revenue is recognized ratably over contractual terms, reflecting future orientation, and we expect it to increase as we introduce new subscriptions, renew existing contracts, and expand our installed base; cost of revenue, gross margins, and operating expenses are driven by product mix, amortization of intellectual property licenses, increases in personnel and professional services costs, and allocated costs, all of which we expect to scale and optimize over time to maintain performance; we issued convertible senior notes to enhance financial resource flexibility and risk mitigation; and our critical accounting policies—in revenue recognition, share-based compensation, income taxes, contract manufacturer liabilities, loss contingencies, and the valuation and impairment of goodwill, intangible, and long-lived assets—require significant estimates and judgments regarding future economic and market conditions, reflecting our capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite internal or external disturbances.

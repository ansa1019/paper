Comcast continues to invest in advanced network and customer-premise technologies, including accelerated deployment of its IP and cloud-enabled X1 platform, cloud DVR technology and wireless gateways, and the improvement of its network infrastructure to increase network capacity and improve the performance of multiple Internet-enabled devices used at the same time within the home, thereby supporting service continuity and operational flexibility; to mitigate anticipated increases in operating costs and expenses, particularly programming expenses, management will attempt to grow revenue, especially in its high-speed Internet, video and business services businesses; the company maintains significant availability under its $6.25 billion and $1.35 billion revolving credit facilities and related commercial paper programs, routinely meets its leverage covenants by a significant margin and believes it can continue to meet its short-term and long-term liquidity and capital requirements through cash flows from operating activities, available borrowings and access to external financing, thereby preserving financial resilience; it allocates substantial cash flows toward capital expenditures, fixed charges, strategic investments such as its 51 percent interest in Universal Studios Japan and the establishment of Aterios Group to invest up to $4 billion in growth-oriented companies, and proactive share repurchase and dividend programs to optimize its capital structure; its businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments subject to seasonal and cyclical variations, and the company adjusts resources, manages timing of content licensing and production spending, and defers revenue associated with event-driven broadcasts to deliver stable performance under varying market and event-driven conditions; these strategic, financial and operational measures reflect an ability to absorb strain, reconfigure resource deployment and preserve or improve functioning despite external disturbances, cost pressures and competitive challenges.

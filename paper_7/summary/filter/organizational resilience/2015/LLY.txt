The MD&A discloses a range of processes and policies that support the Company’s capacity to adjust and maintain performance under challenging conditions, including a systematic review of supply levels and an effort “to maintain U.S. wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio,” the establishment of sales return, rebate and discount accruals “in the same period as the related sales,” and accrual of liabilities for Medicaid and managed care rebates when sales are recorded, with adjustments made as actual payments are recognized.  The Company “manages research and development spending across our portfolio of molecules, and a delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending,” recognizing that “a high rate of failure is inherent in new drug discovery and development” and maintaining a diversified pipeline of approximately 50 potential new drugs.  To mitigate financial volatility, the Company “addresses a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments,” entering into foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge exposures “primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro, Japanese yen, and British pound” and interest rate derivatives “to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions,” with sensitivity analyses showing that a hypothetical 10 percent change in rates would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows or fair values.  The Company continually “monitors the potential impacts of the economic environment; the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers; the uncertain impact of health care legislation; and various international government funding levels,” maintains liquidity through commercial paper and committed bank credit facilities, and adjusts its cost structure via “ongoing cost containment efforts to reduce our cost structure and global workforce” as well as “severance costs, integration costs for Novartis AH, and asset impairments.”  Critical accounting estimates—such as discount rates and expected return on pension plan assets, sales return and rebate accruals, and impairment tests for long-lived and indefinite-lived assets—are applied using actuarial yield curves and historical data, with the Company acknowledging that future adjustments to these reserves or impairment charges could affect consolidated results, thereby demonstrating resource reconfiguration, risk assessment, and adaptability in response to both nominal and extreme internal and external variations.

Management emphasizes its competence to develop and launch new and enhanced products, services, and capabilities and to implement supporting infrastructure in a timely and successful manner, noting significant campus expansion work and technology projects throughout the year; technology-related expenditures include increased software maintenance expenses, additional software licenses, and professional services investments in projects to drive efficiency and scale, while capitalized costs for developing internal-use software totaled $165 million and ongoing amortization of internally developed software reflects continued investments in software and technology enhancements. The firm describes its operations as highly dependent on the integrity and resilience of critical business functions and technology systems, supported by a robust backup and recovery infrastructure, routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans, and a well-established incident management program. Information security capabilities have been strengthened through a comprehensive program that integrates complementary tools, controls, and technologies to protect systems, client accounts, and data, with continuous monitoring, advanced systems to detect suspicious activity, strict access controls and internal authentication measures, and employee training in privacy and security. Schwab’s enterprise risk management framework encompasses functional risk subcommittees covering information security, fraud, third-party risk, data, and model governance, supported by policies for model risk management—including centralized registration and risk-rating of models—as well as third-party risk oversight through contractual provisions, control standards, ongoing performance monitoring, and appropriate testing, and by an incentive compensation risk oversight committee reporting to the board. The planned acquisitions of USAA-IMCO assets and TD Ameritrade are expected to add scale to enhance the client experience, provide deeper resources for advisory clients, and continue to improve operating efficiency, and capital planning anticipates continued investment in technology projects equivalent to approximately 5–6 percent of total net revenues in 2020.

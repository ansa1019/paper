Berkshire Hathaway’s discussion does not explicitly address information technology capability, yet several disclosures implicitly reflect the deployment and coordination of digital and information‐processing resources across its decentralized operating businesses. GEICO’s emphasis on direct response marketing “via the internet or over the telephone” implies investments in digital channels, customer connectivity and underlying IT systems to support quoting, underwriting and policy administration. Business Wire’s “electronic news distribution, multimedia and regulatory filings” likewise signals an information management capability that delivers timely, secure and customized data services to clients. The distribution of electronic components by TTI and FlightSafety’s provision of “high technology training products and services” further suggest operational processes built upon specialized technology infrastructures and personnel competencies. The repeated characterization of Berkshire’s operating model as “unusually decentralized” with “minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities” points to a federated IT governance approach, whereby each subsidiary acquires, deploys and leverages its own technology resources in alignment with its specific business strategies and needs. These elements together portray a firm that mobilizes digital technologies, connectivity and information management systems—in combination with other organizational resources—to support subsidiary‐level innovation, agility and competitive performance even though such capabilities are not explicitly labeled as “IT capability” in the report.

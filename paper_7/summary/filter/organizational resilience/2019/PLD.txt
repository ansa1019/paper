Management’s discussion and analysis underscores the firm’s systematic coordination of its resources and processes through the allocation of property management and leasing costs across segments based on square footage, the adoption of the new lease accounting standard and practical expedient for combined rental revenues, and the use of both GAAP and non-GAAP performance metrics—such as net operating income by segment, funds from operations and same-store property NOI adjusted for straight-line rent and fair-value lease amendments—to support timely, comparable decision-making across consolidated and unconsolidated portfolios. The Company applies income-approach valuation techniques—discounted cash flow models and capitalization rates derived from market data—for acquisition accounting and impairment testing, and it leverages centralized liquidity and capital management infrastructures, including a $3.5 billion global senior credit facility, multiple unsecured term loans, senior notes issuances and natural hedges through currency-matching debt and derivative instruments, to maintain operational flexibility, manage foreign currency exposure and finance ongoing development and acquisition activities. Continuous monitoring of key operating metrics—occupancy, rent change on rollover, turnover costs, weighted-average stabilized yields and development pipeline leasing percentages—together with structured equity commitments and co-investment ventures across geographies, reflects an integrated approach to mobilizing and deploying financial, human and process-based resources in support of business strategies, risk management and the firm’s performance objectives.

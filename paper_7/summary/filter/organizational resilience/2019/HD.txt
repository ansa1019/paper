Our disclosures indicate that online sales, defined as sales generated online through our websites for products picked up in our stores or delivered to customer locations, represented 9.3% of net sales and grew 19.4% during fiscal 2019, and that comparable sales is measured across all locations, physical and online, open greater than 52 weeks, with acquisitions, digital or otherwise, included in comparable sales after they have been owned for more than 52 weeks, reflecting integration of digital channels into our core performance metrics; we further note that the execution of our strategic efforts to drive an enhanced interconnected experience in both the physical and digital worlds has supported comparable sales growth. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have shifted certain store support operations to remote or virtual, expanded our paid time off policy for associates and adjusted store operating hours, demonstrating operational flexibility underpinned by technology-enabled processes. Capital expenditures of approximately $2.8 billion planned for fiscal 2020 may be adjusted as necessary or appropriate to support the operations of the business, and our purchase obligations explicitly include software acquisitions and license commitments as well as legally binding service contracts, underscoring continued investment in technology resources. Finally, our liquidity and capital resources strategy—including commercial paper programs backed by credit facilities, additional credit facilities and senior note issuances—is designed to provide sufficient funding for both our ongoing operational requirements and capital investment priorities, thereby enabling adaptive deployment of technology-based initiatives to support business needs.

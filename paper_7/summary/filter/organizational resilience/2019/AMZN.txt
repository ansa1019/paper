We make substantial and increasing investments in technology and content, including technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve process efficiencies, support our cross-functional systems and operations, and expand new and existing product categories and service offerings, notably through AWS global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online stores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment and delivery networks and related facilities. Technology and content costs comprise payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services, and infrastructure costs—servers, networking equipment, data-center depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses needed to support both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees and to continue to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may rapidly enhance the customer experience and improve process efficiency at scale. We believe advances in technology—specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, advances in wireless connectivity, and practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning—will continue to improve the consumer experience and its ubiquity, and to best take advantage of these advances we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. Capital expenditures for technology infrastructure, primarily to support AWS, were $11.3 billion and $12.7 billion in 2018 and 2019, and property and equipment acquired under finance leases of $10.6 billion and $13.7 billion in those years reflect our continued investments in IT infrastructure. We expect technology and content costs to grow at a slower rate in 2020 due to an increase in the estimated useful life of our servers.

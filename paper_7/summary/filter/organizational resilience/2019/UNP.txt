The company emphasizes its deployment of technology and data-driven approaches to support operational safety and reliability, noting that it will continue using a multi-faceted approach to safety, utilizing technology, risk assessment, training and employee engagement, quality control and targeted capital investments, and has formed an operating practices command center to identify causes of mainline service interruptions and develop solutions while assisting employees with understanding policies, procedures and best practices for handling trains. It further states that it will continue its efforts to utilize data to identify and mitigate risk; detect rail defects; improve or close crossings; and educate the public and law enforcement agencies about crossing safety through a combination of its own programs (including risk assessment strategies), industry programs and local community activities. In addition, capital investments include $95 million for positive train control and $255 million for technology and other, while other expenses explicitly include computer software, reflecting the firmâ€™s allocation of resources to information systems. The company also reports a number of key performance measures weekly to the Surface Transportation Board and provides this data on its website, underscoring its commitment to information provision and transparency. Initiatives such as Unified Plan 2020 and G55+0 are described as designed to better align management structure and decision-making processes to be more agile and responsive to customer needs by increasing the reliability of its service product, reducing variability in network operations and improving resource utilization, indicating an ongoing integration of technology-enabled resources and management capabilities to enhance operational efficiency and competitive performance.

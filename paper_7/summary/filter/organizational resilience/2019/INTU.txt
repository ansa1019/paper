Management’s discussion highlights that as we offer more online services, the ongoing operation and availability of our platforms and systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important; we face risks associated with the hosting, collection, use and retention of personal customer information and data, and accordingly we are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities, including additional security measures and collaboration with state and federal governments to share information on suspicious filings and protect against fraud. In support of our business strategies and work processes, we have expanded our online ecosystem—comprising QuickBooks Online accounting, payroll, payments and financing offerings, TurboTax Online and Live, ProConnect Tax Online and related connected services—to deliver data-driven insights, enhanced customer experiences and subscription-based offerings, with QuickBooks Online subscribers growing 32% year-over-year to 4.5 million and service and other revenue representing 76% of consolidated revenues, while cost of service and other revenue reflects data center and customer support expenses for these platforms. Our fiscal 2018 acquisitions of TSheets.com LLC, Exactor, Inc. and Applatix, Inc. further augmented our capability to automate time tracking, scheduling and tax filing, integrating technology resources to drive operational flexibility and competitive advantage. These investments underscore our ongoing mobilization and deployment of IT-based resources—security, infrastructure, software development and support—to enhance operational efficiency, maintain information accuracy and reliability, ensure system availability and align technology functionalities with evolving business needs and regulatory requirements.

In 2019, the company continued to strengthen its IT capability through focused investments in research and development—driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses—and by absorbing higher infrastructure-related costs within selling, general and administrative expense, reflecting increased spending on marketing, advertising and enhancements to corporate information systems. Capital expenditures of $7.6 billion included product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, data centers and corporate facilities and infrastructure, encompassing information systems hardware, software and enhancements, underscoring the firm’s commitment to deploying IT‐based resources in support of its business strategies and operational flexibility. Other purchase obligations include noncancelable commitments for internet and telecommunications services, illustrating ongoing allocation of resources toward connectivity and digital infrastructure. The company’s revenue recognition process further demonstrates the integration of IT capabilities, as it allocates revenue to hardware components, bundled software upgrade rights and product-related services such as iCloud, Siri and Maps based on estimated standalone selling prices and amortizes deferred amounts over the periods during which these services are provided.

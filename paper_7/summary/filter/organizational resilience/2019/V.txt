Our advanced transaction processing network, VisaNet, enables authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and allows us to provide our financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, value-added services, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally, and network and processing expenses mainly represent expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services.

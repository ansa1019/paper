Mastercard describes itself as a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks. Through its unique and proprietary global payments network, which it refers to as its core network, Mastercard switches (authorizes, clears and settles) payment transactions and delivers related products and services, and it has additional payment capabilities that include automated clearing house (ACH) transactions (both batch and real-time account-based payments). It also provides integrated value-added offerings such as cyber and intelligence products, information and analytics services, consulting, loyalty and reward programs and processing, with other revenues growth primarily driven by its cyber & intelligence and data & services solutions. These payment solutions offer customers choice and flexibility and are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments system. Growth in operating expenses reflects continued investment in strategic initiatives supported by increased personnel, while depreciation and amortization expense growth was driven by amortization of certain intangible assets and depreciation on data center assets, underscoring the firm’s investment in technology infrastructure and information management capabilities. General and administrative expenses include data processing and telecommunications as well as foreign exchange activity related to remeasurement of assets and derivative contracts, illustrating the firm’s reliance on technology-enabled processes to manage transactional and translational currency exposure. Moreover, the calculation of key performance metrics such as gross dollar volume and gross euro volume depends on technology systems that convert local currency spending volumes into reporting currencies, highlighting the coordination of IT-based resources in support of global transaction processing and financial reporting.

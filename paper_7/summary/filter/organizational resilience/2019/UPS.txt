UPSâ€™s ongoing investment in automated facilities and other transformation initiatives was enabled by the deployment and utilization of technology to increase package sorting and delivery productivity by reducing manual touchpoints. Capital spending on information technology increased to $774 million in 2019 from $709 million in 2018, driven by continuing development of technology-enabled solutions and capitalized software projects. The increase in other expenses for the year included technology equipment and software licenses, and our purchase commitments schedule reflects contractual agreements to procure technology equipment alongside vehicles and facilities. In October 2019, we refined the bond matching approach used to determine discount rates for our U.S. pension and postretirement plans by implementing advances in technology and modeling techniques, resulting in a $900 million decrease in projected benefit obligations and an $810 million reduction in pre-tax mark-to-market charges.

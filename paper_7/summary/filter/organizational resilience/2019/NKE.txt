During fiscal 2019, Nike continued investing in its IT and digital infrastructure, with selling and administrative expenses reflecting dedicated investments in data and analytics capabilities, digital commerce platforms and an initial enterprise resource planning tool to accelerate end-to-end digital transformation, contributing to digital commerce outpacing all other channels with 35% growth and underpinning compelling consumer experiences through Nike.com, related mobile applications and Nike Direct retail. These investments were primarily recorded within global brand divisionsâ€™ operating overhead expense as part of centralized enterprise technology and digital operations, and were described as essential to fueling the next phase of long-term growth and profitability. Management further indicated that fiscal 2020 capital expenditures are expected to approximate 3% to 4% of revenues, directed toward corporate facilities, expansion of its digital capabilities and new Nike Direct store openings to support ongoing digital infrastructure development and business strategy execution.

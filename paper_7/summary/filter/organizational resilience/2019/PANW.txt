Our management’s discussion emphasizes that we have “pioneered the next generation of security through our innovative platform” which “uses an innovative traffic classification engine that identifies network traffic by application, user, and content and provides consistent security across the network, endpoint, and cloud,” thereby enabling end-customers to pursue “transformative digital initiatives, like public cloud and mobility,” while maintaining the visibility, control, and protection of data and critical control systems that underpin information management capabilities. We believe the “architecture of our platform offers superior performance compared to legacy approaches and reduces the total cost of ownership for organizations by simplifying their security operations and infrastructure and eliminating the need for multiple, stand-alone hardware and software security products,” with our next-generation firewall and proprietary PAN-OS operating system delivering a “consistent set of capabilities” across physical appliances, virtual firewalls, and cloud environments. Our subscription offerings provide “real-time access to the latest antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, and modern malware prevention capabilities across the network, endpoints, and the cloud,” reflecting our emphasis on expanding cloud-based services and ensuring information accuracy, timeliness, and reliability. We continue to invest in innovation to “evolve and further extend the capabilities of our platform,” as evidenced by our acquisitions of RedLock’s cloud security analytics, the introduction of PAN-OS 9.0 and DNS security service subscriptions, the launch of Cortex XDR for integrated detection and response, and the additions of Demisto’s SOAR, PureSec’s serverless security, and Twistlock’s container security. We believe our growth and competitive position depend on our “ability to extend our technology leadership, grow our base of end-customers, expand deployment of our platform and support offerings within existing end-customers, and focus on end-customer satisfaction,” and to “improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner,” recognizing that mobilizing and combining IT-based resources with other organizational assets is essential to sustaining business transformation, operational efficiency, and competitive advantage.

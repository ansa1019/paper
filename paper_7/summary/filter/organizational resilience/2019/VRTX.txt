Our revenue recognition and financial reporting processes rely on extensive information management capabilities, including the estimation of transaction prices through forecasts of payor mix and government‐mandated rebates, the tracking of contractual terms and distribution‐channel data to adjust estimates as new information becomes available, and the deferral of consideration when annual reimbursement limits trigger free‐of‐charge product shipments; our business combinations and intangible asset valuations employ the multi‐period excess earnings method of the income approach and probability‐weighted discounted cash flow models—requiring management judgments about technical and regulatory success rates, development cost assumptions, revenue and growth projections, commercial cost estimates and discount rates—and our contingent consideration liabilities are remeasured quarterly using assumptions on the timing and probability of milestone achievement; these estimates are grounded in historical experience and prevailing market and regulatory conditions; to support our research, development and commercialization activities we invest in, acquire and collaborate with biopharmaceutical and technology companies, academic research institutions, government laboratories and other organizations to access needed technological resources and capabilities and we manage strategic equity investments in both public and private entities separately from our core cash and marketable securities; we are subject to extensive data protection and privacy laws across the U.S., EU, Canada, Australia and other jurisdictions and devote substantial resources to maintain, administer and expand global compliance programs; and our critical accounting policies for revenue recognition, acquisitions (including goodwill and in‐process R&D), and income taxes reflect the material impact of significant judgments, assumptions and the timely incorporation of estimate revisions into our reported results.

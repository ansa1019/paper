Within our platform for sustained performance, “digitizing the enterprise” is identified as a key enabler, reflecting management’s recognition that the digital evolution is changing consumers’ behaviors, influencing how they shop and interact and creating an opportunity to partner in different ways with our customers and re-engineer our supply chain and route-to-market; at the corporate level, we have established an enabling services organization focused on simplifying and standardizing key transactional processes and providing support to business units through global centers of excellence, mobilizing IT-based resources to deliver consistent data standards, availability and connectivity; moreover, in connection with productivity and reinvestment initiatives and the refranchising of certain bottling operations, we incurred costs to implement information technology systems designed to facilitate consistent data standards and availability throughout our bottling systems, underscoring our commitment to deploy and leverage technology infrastructure in combination with other organizational resources to enhance process optimization, operational flexibility and strategic alignment across our internal and interfirm relationships.

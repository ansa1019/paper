Management’s discussion and analysis is provided as a supplement to our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are presented in U.S. dollars, reflecting our coordination of financial reporting processes and assets. We record product sales net of estimated government and other rebates and chargebacks, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and other related deductions, with allowances estimated based on products sold, historical payer mix, pertinent third-party industry information, estimated patient populations, known market events or trends and channel inventory data obtained from our major U.S. wholesalers, demonstrating our capability to provide information with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness and reliability and to tailor these estimates as business needs change. We use foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a percentage of our foreign currency exposure, enabling the deployment of financial resources in support of our global operations. Up-front and milestone payments related to collaborative and other arrangements are classified as cash flows from investing activities, exemplified by our transformative R&D collaboration with Galapagos NV that doubled our R&D footprint and accelerated development of novel treatments. We manage R&D expenses by identifying anticipated activities and prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of technical and regulatory success, market potential, available human and capital resources and other considerations, and we continually review and reallocate resources across internal and external projects based on unmet medical need to support long-term growth. Our strategic priorities—expanding internal and external innovation, strengthening portfolio strategy and decision making, increasing patient benefit and access and evolving our culture—guide resource and capital allocation, underscoring our IT capability to mobilize and deploy IT-based and other organizational resources in support of business strategies. We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and periodically reassess these matters as new information arises, and our contractual obligations cover operating leases, API purchase commitments, capital commitments and advertising and R&D commitments, illustrating our coordination of interfirm relationships and resource integration. Our corporate strategy provides focus and directs resource allocation priorities, and we continue to pursue collaborations, partnerships and strategic investments while expecting data read-outs in 2020 for key programs such as filgotinib for ulcerative colitis and KTE-X19 for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, highlighting the importance of our information management capability and decision-making processes. In connection with tax reform, we recorded a federal income tax payable for the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings payable over an eight-year period, reflecting our governance and resource allocation in response to changing regulatory context.

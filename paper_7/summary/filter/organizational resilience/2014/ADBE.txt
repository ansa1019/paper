In our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we disclose that in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP and SEC regulations, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, that we evaluate on a regular basis and discuss with the Audit Committee, acknowledging that actual results could differ materially and that changes in assumptions or judgments could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue we report, reflecting our ongoing risk assessment and adaptive processes. In connection with business acquisitions—including Neolane, Behance and Efficient Frontier—we integrated the acquired companies into our Digital Marketing and Digital Media reportable segments, allocated purchase price to acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values at the acquisition date, and continue to monitor and adjust purchase price allocations and perform goodwill impairment tests that consider future expected cash flows, market factors and internal forecasts to preserve system integrity under internal or external variations. We maintain a currency-hedging program to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency impact from the euro, British pound and Japanese yen on our revenue and regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes from income tax examinations to determine adequate provisions, acknowledging that unrecognized tax benefits could change materially as audits conclude or statutes of limitations expire. To support our financial flexibility and operational continuity, we have a $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and $1.5 billion of senior notes, monitor financial covenants and leverage ratios, and assert that our existing cash, cash equivalents, investments and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet working capital, restructuring and strategic acquisition funding requirements. During fiscal 2014, we implemented a restructuring plan in which we recorded charges for employee termination benefits and closing redundant facilities, accrued ongoing obligations, and expect remaining cash outlays to be funded from existing resources. We have transformed our business model toward a more recurring, predictable revenue base through Creative Cloud subscriptions and enterprise term license agreements, driving growth in paid subscriptions and annualized recurring revenue and using these metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our digital media segment. We are currently evaluating the effect of the forthcoming revenue recognition standard on our consolidated financial statements, maintain unbilled deferred revenue backlog as a component of long-term contract commitments, and engage in structured stock repurchase agreements—prepaying funds to repurchase shares at guaranteed discounts when the foregone return on prepayment is outweighed by the transaction discount—to optimize capital allocation and maintain strategic agility in the face of environmental disruptions and market volatility.

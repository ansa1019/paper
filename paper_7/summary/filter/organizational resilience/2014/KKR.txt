KKR’s business model emphasizes the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions through diversified investment strategies, robust capital deployment and adaptive resource allocation across multiple economic environments.  We conduct our business with offices throughout the world, providing a pre-eminent global platform for sourcing transactions, raising capital and carrying out capital markets activities, and we have consistently expanded our geographical presence and built new lines of business, such as energy, infrastructure and alternative credit, to leverage intellectual capital and synergies.  Our investment teams, supported by a substantial and diversified capital base, an integrated global investment platform, operating consultants and senior advisors, draw on deep industry knowledge and specialized due diligence resources to mitigate risks, reconfigure capital structures and capitalize on investment opportunities across market cycles.  With more than 75 percent of fee-paying assets under management not subject to redemption for at least eight years, we maintain significant operational flexibility to grow investments and select exit opportunities, thereby preserving functioning and firm performance despite external perturbations.  We have also used our balance sheet as a significant source of capital to further grow and expand our business, increase our participation in existing businesses and further align our interests with those of our fund investors.  We manage liquidity through diversified fee streams—management, monitoring and transaction fees—and through the use of credit facilities, senior notes and contingent capital commitments to absorb strain and preserve continuity even amid volatility in global equity and debt markets, currency fluctuations, interest-rate movements and economic downturns.  Our long-term investment horizon, patient and disciplined approach and emphasis on providing tailored solutions and innovation in products and services together reflect a systemic perspective and dynamic capabilities that support the organization’s ability to foresee, confront and benefit from sudden disruptive change to survive, grow and flourish.

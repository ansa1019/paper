The Company’s discussion describes a range of strategic initiatives, resource allocations and operational processes designed to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under internal and external variations, constraints and disruptions.  It highlights the expansion of our enterprise cloud computing solutions through internal development and acquisitions to enhance platform capabilities with new editions, solutions, enhanced features and a new analytics solution and the integration of acquired businesses and technologies to maintain service continuity and competitive advantage.  We continue to expand data center capacity and global infrastructure, hire additional personnel—particularly in direct sales, customer-related areas and research and development—and extend distribution into new and high-growth categories to deploy resources dynamically and sustain performance under pressure.  To mitigate risks associated with customer attrition, economic conditions, emerging competitors and technology disruptions, we monitor attrition rates, focus on retaining customers at renewal, provide high-quality technical support, encourage third-party application development on our platform and invest in strategic relationships and marketing programs to build brand awareness and pursue new and existing customers.  Our regular evaluation of acquisitions, joint ventures, services and technologies, coupled with reinvestment of incremental revenue, supports ongoing transformation and system integrity.  We operate on a single multi-tenant platform as one reporting segment to simplify resource coordination and decision making, and we employ seasonality analysis, risk assessment and cash management practices—including the use of convertible senior notes, credit facilities and marketable securities—to maintain liquidity, satisfy covenants and optimize operating cash flow.  These collective measures reflect a systemic perspective on resilience, adaptability and the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

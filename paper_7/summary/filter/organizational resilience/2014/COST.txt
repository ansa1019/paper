Costco has historically adapted its business to economic fluctuations by adjusting pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing penetration of private-label items, and by leveraging selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales through comparable sales growth while mitigating the impacts of currency exchange rate changes and gasoline price deflation. The company’s strategic focus on cost control and operational flexibility is supported by continued investment in modernizing information systems and by maintaining compensation levels above industry averages to reduce employee turnover and enhance satisfaction. A consistent operating model across U.S., Canadian and other international segments, together with disciplined capital expenditure planning—financed by operating cash flows, existing liquidity and short-term investments—and the maintenance of committed bank credit facilities and commercial paper programs for working capital, underpins business continuity. Costco’s accounting policies for deferred membership fee recognition, merchandise inventory valuation under LIFO and FIFO, and quarterly impairment assessments further ensure the integrity of financial reporting and capital allocation. Collectively, these strategies and mechanisms enable the organization to absorb strain, reconfigure resources and sustain performance under both nominal and adverse external pressures, reflecting the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

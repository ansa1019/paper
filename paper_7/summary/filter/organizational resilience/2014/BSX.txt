The Management’s Discussion and Analysis describes how the Company “monitors the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry, and the markets in which we compete; and assesses opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and to better align expenses with revenues, while preserving our ability to make the investments in research and development projects, capital, our people and other programs that we believe are important to drive our growth,” reflecting an ongoing adaptive assessment of external pressures and strategic resource reconfiguration to maintain performance under changing conditions. The report states that “we have undertaken various restructuring initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for long-term success,” highlights that “cash generated by operating activities was $1.269 billion in 2014 … our cash generated from operations continues to be a significant source of funds for investing in our growth and returning value to shareholders,” and underscores liquidity and continuity planning by noting that “we believe our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents, future cash generated from operations and access to capital markets and revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations, invest in our infrastructure, pay our legal-related liabilities, fund possible mergers and/or acquisitions, service our existing debt and return value to investors,” illustrating resource generation, deployment and contingency preparedness. Risk mitigation and system resilience are further evident in the Company’s emphasis on its investment-grade credit profile that “reflects the size and diversity of our product portfolio, our leading share position … our strong cash flow, our solid financial fundamentals and our financial strategy,” its practice to “invest excess cash on hand in short-term financial instruments that earn market interest rates while mitigating principal risk through instrument and counterparty diversification” and to “limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer,” and in its acknowledgement that “government and private sector initiatives related to limiting the growth of healthcare costs … may limit the price of, or the level at which reimbursement is provided for, our products” and that “any changes in government policies … could adversely affect our business and results of operations,” all of which frame a systemic approach to navigating regulatory, market and financial perturbations. Additionally, the Company’s description of acquisition activities—“we believe that this acquisition enhances our ability to offer physicians and healthcare systems a more complete portfolio of solutions to treat challenging vascular conditions”—and its recognition of impairment charges “as a result of changes in our clinical strategy and lower estimates of the European and global hypertension markets” exemplify the reconfiguring of assets and strategic adaptation in response to unexpected shifts in market and clinical environments.

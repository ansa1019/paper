In fiscal 2014, we announced and completed a workforce reduction plan impacting approximately 4,000 employees and, consistent with our ongoing transformation strategy, redirected the resulting savings into key growth areas such as data center, software, security, and cloud to enhance our agility and operational flexibility; concurrently, we continued to transform our business model by moving from selling individual products and services to integrated architectures and customer-outcome solutions, reorganizing both our structure and delivery methods to better adapt to market transitions and evolving customer requirements. To mitigate risks and preserve operational continuity under challenging conditions, we maintain rigorous inventory and supply-chain management processes that balance flexibility and lead-time performance against inventory obsolescence risk, record liabilities for firm, noncancelable purchase commitments in excess of demand forecasts, and regularly evaluate our exposure to excess inventory and supplier component failures, including a $655 million remediation charge for memory-component issues. We also uphold robust loss contingency and warranty accrual practices and monitor exposure from product returns, patent litigation, and customer financing guarantees, and employ a diversified financing strategy—comprising secured customer leases and loans, a committed credit facility, debt issuances, and disciplined free-cash-flow generation and repatriation—to ensure we can absorb external disturbances, maintain liquidity, and preserve performance under pressure. Our strategy to deliver integrated solutions is designed to help customers grow, manage costs, and mitigate risk, reflecting our systemic perspective on business continuity and resilience as we proactively invest in innovation, agility, and efficiency to navigate environmental turbulence, support recovery from disruptive change, and sustain competitive advantage.

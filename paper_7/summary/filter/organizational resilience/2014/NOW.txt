Servicenow’s filings emphasize investments in scalable cloud-based infrastructure, service continuity and strategic resource allocation as core to absorbing strain and preserving performance under adversity. By applying a service-oriented lens to structure and automate day-to-day enterprise tasks, we enable customers to operate faster and more scalably, reflecting a systemic perspective on maintaining integrity amid environmental perturbations. We continue to invest in the development of our services, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth while managing external pressures and uncertainties. Our subscription offering includes hosting and support services, data backup and disaster recovery capabilities and future upgrades to ensure business continuity during disruptions, and our generally non-cancelable contract terms reinforce revenue stability and operational flexibility. We anticipate that our existing cash, cash generated from operations and access to financing—including our convertible senior notes and potential equity or debt offerings—will suffice to fund data center expansion, lease commitments, headcount growth, fixed-asset investments and strategic transactions for at least the next twelve months, thereby underpinning our capacity to adapt, reconfigure resources and emerge stronger from challenging situations. Continuous research and development expenditures target enhancements to our core platform and new applications to meet evolving customer needs, while leveraging data center capacity to drive incremental margin improvements and support organizational resilience through optimized cost structures and sustained service delivery.

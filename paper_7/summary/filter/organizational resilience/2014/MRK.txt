In 2014, Merck continued to execute its multi-year initiative to sharpen its commercial and research and development focus, redesign its operating model and reduce its cost base while remaining focused on innovation, reviewing its asset portfolio to determine which businesses could provide the best short- and longer-term value and divesting its consumer care segment to better resource its core areas of focus.  As part of its intensified portfolio assessment process, the company sold non-core rights, out-licensed or discontinued selected late-stage clinical development assets and reduced its focus on platform technologies, thereby reallocating resources to key growth drivers such as its animal health business and accelerating several of its key clinical programs.  Merck made strong progress redesigning its operating model by reducing its global real estate footprint, improving the efficiency of its manufacturing and supply network, executing global restructuring programs that eliminated positions and streamlined operations with estimated cumulative pretax costs of $11.5 billion and annual net cost savings of $6.6 billion by the end of 2015, and applying disciplined cost management to better target resources to priorities across the enterprise.  The company entered into strategic external collaborations—such as its worldwide development and commercialization agreement with Bayer for soluble guanylate cyclase modulators—and completed acquisitions of Idenix and Oncoethix to enhance its pipeline, reflecting inter-organizational collaboration, resource generation and adaptive strategies in response to external pressures and market volatility.  To mitigate global pricing and reimbursement challenges arising from health care reform, government cost-containment measures and generic competition, Merck took steps to adjust its pricing, manage rebate and discount programs and engage in public-policy advocacy, continually evaluating, adapting and improving its business practices to better meet customer needs.  The company maintains a comprehensive global privacy program and a disciplined financial risk management framework—employing revenue hedging, balance sheet hedging and net investment hedging with derivatives and debt instruments—to protect cash flows and preserve performance under foreign exchange and interest-rate variability.  Through ongoing portfolio prioritization, cost restructuring, external innovation sourcing and enterprise-level risk mitigation, management believes Merck is well positioned to absorb strain, preserve or improve its functioning under challenging conditions and emerge stronger from adversity.

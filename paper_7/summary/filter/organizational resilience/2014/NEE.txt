In 2014, NEE and its subsidiaries implemented initiatives determined during a 2013 enterprise-wide process focused mainly on improving productivity and reducing O&M expenses, reflecting an enterprise-wide cost savings initiative to reconfigure operations and allocate resources under challenging conditions. FPL placed in service the 1,212 MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle Riviera Beach power plant, began construction on the Port Everglades modernization project and received FPSC approval to invest in long-term natural gas supplies in the Woodford Shale region to mitigate supply risks and secure operational continuity. NEE and its subsidiaries maintain total net available liquidity of approximately $7.0 billion through cash flows from operations, short- and long-term borrowings, credit lines and shelf registrations for equity and debt issues, supported by investment-grade credit ratings and collateral facilities, to ensure financial flexibility and resource availability. To manage commodity price, interest rate and foreign currency exposure, NEE uses derivative instruments—primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards—deferring changes in fair value as regulatory assets or liabilities in cost-of-service operations or recognizing them in earnings for non-qualifying hedges, while quantifying market risk through value-at-risk models and controlling counterparty credit risk via established limits, collateral requirements and master netting agreements. Planned capital expenditures and contractual commitments, including funding for nuclear decommissioning studies, fossil and solar plant dismantlement and investment in wind and solar development projects, are designed to uphold system integrity and maintain operating performance across market and regulatory environments.

Our management’s forward-looking statements acknowledge risk and uncertainty, and we have maintained operational flexibility through segment reorganization—such as the elimination of the QWI segment and divestiture of the North and Latin America operations of the Omnitracs division—and through targeted strategic investments in early-stage companies across digital media, e-commerce, energy, healthcare and wearable devices, as well as through the proposed acquisition of CSR to diversify revenue streams and accelerate our presence in growth categories. We allocate seventy-five percent of free cash flow to share repurchases and dividends, supplemented by anticipated borrowings to ensure sufficient U.S. liquidity, while indefinitely reinvesting foreign earnings to manage tax exposures without impairing domestic working capital. Our fabless production model, employing both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing arrangements, supports supply-chain resilience by allowing us to absorb strain in wafer fabrication, assembly and test processes. We continuously update business plans and internal forecasts—exemplified by impairment testing in our QMT division—to preserve or improve functioning under performance variances, and we sustain heavy research and development investments in 3G/4G-LTE, Snapdragon platforms and adjacent technologies to uphold innovation and competitive advantage in dynamic markets. We proactively engage in risk mitigation and stakeholder education to address external pressures, including the NDRC investigation in China and underreporting disputes with licensees, thereby limiting disruptions and preserving organizational coherence. Our financial resilience is further underpinned by rigorous critical accounting estimates for goodwill, intangible assets and marketable securities, which involve scenario analysis and judgment to maintain system integrity and performance under internal and external variations. These integrated measures demonstrate our ability to absorb strain and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, in line with the definition of organizational resilience.

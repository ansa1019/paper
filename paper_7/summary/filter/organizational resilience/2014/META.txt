Our discussion of financial condition and results of operations emphasizes that our forward-looking statements reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs and that our actual results could differ materially due to factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors.” Our consolidated financial statements and related estimates are based on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, although actual outcomes could differ. To maintain business continuity and support future growth, we have expanded data center capacity and technical infrastructure—anticipating capital expenditures in 2015 of approximately $2.8 to $3.2 billion—and we review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying values may not be recoverable, while evaluating the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets whenever impairment indicators arise. In August 2013, we established a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility that allows us to borrow up to $6.5 billion for working capital and general corporate purposes; as of December 31, 2014, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with all covenants. As of December 31, 2014, we held $11.20 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities—of which $1.57 billion was held by foreign subsidiaries intended for indefinite reinvestment—and we currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facilities, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future. We have enhanced our cash-flow management by transitioning from net share settlement to sell-to-cover for withholding taxes on vested equity awards, thereby reducing cash outflows, and we maintain contractual commitments of $2.4 billion related to operating and capital leases and network infrastructure, while provisions for uncertain tax positions, loss contingencies, and litigation reserves are reviewed quarterly and adjusted to reflect negotiations, rulings, and updated information.

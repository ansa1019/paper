Bank of America describes a comprehensive risk management framework designed to ensure business continuity and preserve positive adjustment under challenging conditions, with sound risk management processes— “identify, measure, monitor and control”—across seven key risk types and clear governance roles spanning front-line units, independent risk management and corporate audit. The corporation maintains excess liquidity at the parent and regulated subsidiaries, including high-quality unencumbered securities and cash with central banks, to provide “adequate funding for our businesses throughout market cycles, including periods of financial stress,” and utilizes contingency funding plans, recovery planning and enterprise stress testing under both historical and hypothetical scenarios to assess and prepare for severe market and credit disruptions. Asset and liability management employs interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives, high-quality debt securities and model-driven valuation of mortgage servicing rights to mitigate sensitivities to rate shifts and prepayment volatility, while capital management integrates forward-looking stress testing and the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) to align risk appetite with strategic, liquidity and capital planning. Operational flexibility is demonstrated through Project New BAC, which simplified workflows and streamlined noninterest expenses to achieve annualized cost savings of $8 billion ahead of schedule, and through proactive credit risk initiatives—including loan modification programs, workout options and enhanced delinquency identification—to adapt to evolving credit conditions and sustain performance under pressure.

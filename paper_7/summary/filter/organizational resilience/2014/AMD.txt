During 2014, as part of our strategy to transform our business to attain approximately 50% of our revenue from high-growth adjacent markets by the end of 2015, we continued to focus on introducing a more diverse product portfolio, including the ambidextrous computing roadmap to develop custom high-performance ARM and x86 processor cores for 2016 and a range of new embedded and graphics products, thereby reallocating resources and preserving performance under challenging market conditions. In connection with our continued strategic transformation, effective July 1, 2014, we realigned our organizational structure into two reportable segments—Computing and Graphics and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom—to improve operational flexibility and maintain continuity in a competitive and declining PC market. To strengthen our cost structure and support future objectives, we implemented a restructuring plan that reduced global headcount by approximately 6%, aligned our real estate footprint with the reduced headcount and recorded related severance, contract termination and asset impairment charges, while recognizing that these measures would preserve or improve functioning under adversity. Concurrently, we made progress in improving our balance sheet by re-profiling our debt maturity schedule through repurchases of convertible and senior notes, issuance of new notes, sale-leaseback transactions and establishment of a secured revolving line of credit, actions intended to absorb financial strain, mitigate risk and ensure our ability to fund operations and capital expenditures despite uncertain global economic conditions. We are also negotiating a fifth amendment to our wafer supply agreement with GlobalFoundries to modify pricing and purchase commitments, demonstrating our capacity to reconfigure supply chain arrangements and maintain system integrity and performance under external pressures.

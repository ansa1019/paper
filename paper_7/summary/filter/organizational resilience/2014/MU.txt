“The following discussion contains trend information and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties,” including “the sufficiency of our cash and investments, cash flows from operations and available financing to meet our requirements for at least the next 12 months,” and management’s view that “our cash and investments, cash flows from operations and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through 2015.”  To maintain operational continuity and adapt to environmental turbulence, the Company continuously evaluates alternatives for efficiently financing capital expenditures, dilution-management activities and ongoing operations, including issuing or refinancing secured and unsecured debt and restructuring existing debt; in October 2014 the Board authorized discretionary repurchases of up to $1.0 billion of common stock, funded with cash on hand.  In 2014 we generated $5.70 billion of cash from operations, obtained $2.21 billion of debt proceeds and reduced the dilutive effects of our convertible notes by exchanging, converting or repurchasing obligations that otherwise would have converted into 118 million shares of common stock, and we further optimized capital structure through exchanges, conversions and settlements, repurchases, issuances and early repayments of debt.  To support strategic agility and resource reconfiguration, we reorganized our business units in the third quarter of 2014 and, in advance of the MMJ acquisition, began transitioning production at one Singapore wafer fabrication facility from DRAM to NAND flash to balance our future product mix; we are likewise in negotiations to extend our Inotera supply agreement, which contemplates annual renewals and a potential wind-down period with phased capacity declines.  We mitigate credit risk by investing through high-credit-quality institutions with concentration limits, manage foreign-currency exposures through derivative instruments and maintain credit facilities providing up to $408 million of additional financing.  In order to optimize operations, improve efficiency and focus on core memory operations, we have entered into various restructuring activities, including the wind-down of 200 mm operations in Italy and Israel, workforce optimization accruals of $14 million as of August 28, 2014, and settlements of contingent liabilities such as the $233 million charge to resolve the Rambus litigation and enter into a patent cross-license agreement.  Contractual obligations include approximately $1.18 billion of commitments for property, plant and equipment expected to be paid within one year and estimated 2015 capital spending of $3.6 billion to $4.0 billion, demonstrating proactive resource allocation and resilience strategies under volatile market conditions.  Off-balance-sheet capped-call arrangements were entered into to reduce potential dilution from convertible notes, offering cash or share receipts up to $864 million based on share price thresholds.  Critical accounting estimates for business acquisitions, consolidation of variable interest entities, contingencies, income taxes, inventory valuations and property, plant and equipment impairments require significant judgments, assumptions and forecasts, reflecting the Company’s systematic risk assessment and capacity to absorb strain and preserve performance under internal and external pressures.

ACE’s corporate structure has facilitated the development of management talent by giving each profit center’s senior management team the necessary autonomy within underwriting authorities to make operating decisions and create products and coverages needed by its target customer base, thereby enabling dynamic adaptation to changing market conditions. We employ layered risk management strategies for our variable annuity guarantees and property catastrophe exposures, including claim limits, structured reinsurance programs combining excess layers with collateralized and reinstatable coverage, repurchase agreements for short-term funding, and dedicated investment portfolios duration-matched to related liabilities to mitigate financial market risk and maintain operational continuity. Our loss reserving framework, which involves collaboration among actuarial, underwriting, claims, legal, and finance departments, quarterly loss emergence monitoring, annual actuarial central estimates, and independent third-party reviews, allows us to refine reserve estimates, respond to loss trends, and preserve our financial integrity under uncertain claim development. We actively monitor our catastrophe risk accumulation globally, routinely review our reinsurance protection and exposure levels, and believe that our cash balance, highly liquid investments, credit facilities, and reinsurance arrangements provide sufficient liquidity to meet unforeseen claim demands. In addition, we maintain access to the capital markets and manage credit facilities subject to covenant tests to ensure our ability to fund obligations, absorb strain, and sustain performance under internal or external variations and disturbances.

The company describes a range of strategic and operational measures that collectively support its capacity to absorb strain and maintain or improve performance under adverse conditions.  In April 2014, the board approved a tax-free spin-off of the dealer services business “to allow both companies to focus on their respective businesses, industries, and strategic opportunities” and to redirect attention and resources to ADP’s core mission and three innovation-driven strategic pillars.  Throughout fiscal 2014, ADP “continued to benefit from the strength of our pays per control metric,” achieved a record 91.4% client revenue retention rate in employer services, and grew recurring revenues by 8%, illustrating operational scale and flexibility.  Investments in product innovation, technology, and salesforce productivity drove margin expansion across employer services (up 150 basis points to 29.5%), PEO services (margin up 20 basis points to 10.3%), and dealer services (up 130 basis points to 21.9%), reflecting continuous adaptation and efficiency improvements.  Liquidity and risk mitigation are anchored by “prudent and conservative investment guidelines”—with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as foremost objectives—laddered maturities of client funds up to ten years in predominantly AAA/AA-rated fixed-income securities, and robust short-term financing programs (up to $7.5 billion of commercial paper, $3.25 billion committed reverse repurchase agreements, and $7.5 billion in revolving credit facilities) to manage varying market and interest-rate cycles.  The organization generated $1.8 billion of operating cash flows, maintained low capital expenditure requirements, returned $1.55 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and extended a 39-year track record of consecutive dividend increases—actions that reinforce business continuity, resource reconfiguration, and the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

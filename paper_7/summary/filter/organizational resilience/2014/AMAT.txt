Applied Materials’ MD&A acknowledges that each of its businesses operates under cyclical industry conditions and that its results can vary significantly year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, reflecting the company’s need to absorb market strain and preserve operational performance. The company has set strategic priorities for fiscal 2015 to grow its presence in wafer fab and display equipment and services, improve solar profitability and expand its overall addressable market, and has entered into a proposed combination with Tokyo Electron Limited “to bring together leading technologies and products and create an expanded set of capabilities.” Management emphasizes its ongoing commitment to substantial investments in research, development and engineering to assure the availability of innovative technology for advanced customer requirements, supported by workforce realignments and reprioritization of existing spend to enable increased funding for critical RD&E programs and selective acquisitions to accelerate access to emerging technologies. Applied’s implementation of global restructuring plans to realign its workforce and cost structure, its backlog management—recognizing that backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales due to potential customer schedule changes—and its disciplined monitoring of days sales outstanding, inventory levels and accounts receivable allowances demonstrate organizational flexibility and risk mitigation under adverse conditions. The company maintains robust liquidity through cash balances, short- and long-term investments, committed credit facilities and selective discounting of letters of credit and receivables, and it believes that cash from operations and available borrowing capacity will satisfy its liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. Annual qualitative assessments of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment, together with prudent accruals for warranty costs and uncertain tax positions, underscore its systemic perspective on preserving asset integrity and emerging stronger from external disturbances.

During 2014, the company pursued a multi-faceted approach to safety—utilizing technology, risk assessment, quality control, training and employee engagement through its total safety culture and courage to care programs—to reduce risk, eliminate incidents and enhance operational flexibility under severe weather, volume growth and network slowdowns. Management continued to analyze the railroad as a single, integrated segment, adding resources to support growth, improve service and replenish surge capability, while deploying defect detection programs and preventive capital investments in crossings to mitigate future derailment and personal injury exposures. Record-setting operating income and an all-time best operating ratio of 63.5% reflect the firm’s capacity to absorb inflation, weather-related costs and a slower network, with core pricing, business demand and productivity more than offsetting incremental costs; free cash flow of $1.5 billion measures the ability to generate cash without additional external financings. Fuel surcharge programs, which trail price fluctuations by approximately two months, together with receivables securitization and a $1.7 billion revolving credit facility, provide liquidity continuity and risk mitigation in volatile fuel and capital markets. The 2015 capital plan—approximately $4.3 billion, with 55%–60% allocated to renewing and improving track infrastructure and fleet assets, key capacity and commercial facility projects, and significant investments in positive train control—underscores a systemic perspective on maintaining integrity and performance under both nominal and extreme conditions. Ongoing use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate and fuel price exposures, continuous monitoring of debt-to-capital ratios, and strategic alignment of resource deployment with projected economic and regulatory environments further demonstrate the organization’s ability to foresee, confront and adapt to disruptive change while preserving operational and financial resilience.

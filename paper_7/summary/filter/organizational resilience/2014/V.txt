Visa’s management acknowledges that overall economic conditions and consumer spending, including the impacts of a modest global economic recovery, exert external pressures on its business, and that the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2014 resulted in a two percentage point decline in total operating revenue growth that it mitigates through a hedging program to preserve performance. The Company balances cost management—reducing professional fees and personnel expenses—with continued investments in infrastructure, technology and network processing to support its global growth initiatives and expand the scope of payment solutions it provides. Treasury policies provide management with guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with corporate objectives, namely to provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and contingency scenarios, ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities, satisfy required litigation settlements through a litigation escrow account under its retrospective responsibility plan, make planned capital investments, pay dividends and repurchase shares, and optimize income on excess cash. Based on current cash flow budgets and forecasts, Visa believes its projected sources of liquidity—including cash on hand, operating cash flows, its available-for-sale investment portfolio subject to credit exposure limits, a $3.0 billion commercial paper program and an unsecured $3.0 billion revolving credit facility—will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs for more than the next twelve months. Settlement risk is actively managed by indemnifying financial institution clients for settlement losses arising from counterparty funding failures and requiring collateral when credit standards are not met, preserving system integrity and client confidence. Legal and regulatory exposures are assessed and liabilities recorded when losses are deemed probable and estimable, with ongoing reassessment of potential claims. Contributions to defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans are made in accordance with actuarial assumptions and discount rates to maintain workforce stability and operational continuity. Capital expenditures have increased to support technology assets, digital solutions and core payments infrastructure, underpinning Visa’s ability to absorb strain, adapt to internal and external variations and preserve or improve its functioning under challenging conditions.

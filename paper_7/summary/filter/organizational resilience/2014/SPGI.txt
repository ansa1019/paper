During 2014, management continued to focus on investments in targeted financial assets, divested selected non-core assets and reduced its real estate portfolio while increasing shareholder return, including acquiring Eclipse Energy Group to complement North American natural gas capabilities, selling its corporate aircraft and data facility, and consolidating headquarters in New York City to streamline infrastructure and reallocate resources toward strategic priorities. The company completed the sale of McGraw Hill Construction and recorded after-tax gains that were used to pay down short-term debt, fund selective acquisitions, investments, share repurchases and general corporate purposes, thereby reconstituting its resource base in response to changing market conditions. As part of its transformation to McGraw Hill Financial, the company undertook a comprehensive review of its accounting and reporting practices, allocating all shared operating services to reportable segments based on usage to provide greater transparency into operating performance and align resources more closely with segment needs. In pursuit of sustainable growth and resilience under regulatory and economic pressures, management aligned efforts against two key strategic priorities—creating growth by focusing on customers and innovation and driving performance by boosting operational excellence, productivity, risk management and compliance while attracting and developing talent. Segment operating models were adapted through bundled offerings in S&P Capital IQ’s desktop, RatingsXpress® and RatingsDirect® platforms, expansion of asset-under-management growth initiatives in S&P Dow Jones Indices ETFs, and continued demand for Platts’ proprietary content and J.D. Power automotive consulting, reflecting the firm’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite external disturbances. The company maintains a strong financial position, asserting that cash on hand, cash flows from operations and availability under its credit facility are expected to be sufficient to meet ongoing operating and recurring cash needs, and employs free cash flow as a conservative measure for assessing its capacity to service debt, fund strategic initiatives and support business continuity. Throughout the year, management recognized significant legal and regulatory settlements and restructuring charges and financed these through operating cash flows, demonstrating organizational robustness and risk mitigation in the face of adversity. Looking forward, the company’s outlook reaffirms its future orientation on providing essential intelligence through benchmarks, ratings, analytics, data and research to enable mission-critical decisions, transform its business in response to environmental turbulence and regulatory changes, and emerge stronger from challenging situations.

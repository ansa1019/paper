Oracle’s Management Discussion and Analysis emphasizes organizational resilience through the design and maintenance of enterprise-grade, reliable, secure and interoperable software and hardware offerings that enable customers to adapt to and recover from internal or external disruptions. The Company commits substantial resources—investing $5.2 billion in research and development in fiscal 2014—to enhance its product portfolio, expand cloud computing and engineered systems capabilities, and accelerate innovation in order to support rapid deployment, integration and cost-efficient operations across on-premise, partner-hosted and Oracle-managed environments. Its standards-based architecture, build-to-order manufacturing process, virtualization, clustering and large-scale systems management facilitate business continuity and operational flexibility, while its storage and networking products are engineered to protect, archive and restore mission-critical data. Oracle’s active acquisition program and related integration and restructuring plans reconfigure resources, absorb scale, broaden offerings and assess prospective transactions against earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return-on-capital targets, thereby mitigating risks and sustaining performance under challenging market conditions. In addition, the Company’s constant currency disclosures, disciplined handling of contingencies, and strategic management of cash flows, debt instruments, dividends and share repurchases further illustrate its capacity to preserve or improve functioning and maintain integrity despite economic and environmental perturbations.

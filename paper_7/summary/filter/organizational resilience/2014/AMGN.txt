In response to competitive, regulatory and economic pressures, Amgen initiated in the second half of 2014 a restructuring plan to reduce its staff and facilities footprint by approximately 23% by the end of 2015, thereby enabling the reallocation of resources to fund innovation and the launch of new pipeline molecules while lowering its cost structure. Concurrently, the company advanced key initiatives to streamline processes, increase organizational agility and efficiencies, and improve operating performance through improved contracting and sourcing, rationalization of discretionary spending, greater use of shared services and optimization of R&D efficiency. Amgen also completed construction and entered the licensure process for a next-generation biomanufacturing facility in Singapore, which it expects to increase manufacturing productivity at lower capital and operating costs, and continues capacity expansions in Puerto Rico and Ireland, illustrating adaptive resource deployment under varying conditions. To mitigate financial risks and preserve liquidity, the company maintains an investment policy limiting credit and maturity exposures, employs interest rate and cross-currency swap contracts designated as fair-value and cash-flow hedges, and established a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility as a backstop to its commercial paper program. Monitoring of global receivables, particularly from European government healthcare providers, and proactive collection measures support cash flow continuity. The firm’s long-term strategy—to discover, develop and commercialize innovative therapies, expand globally and return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases—reflects a systemic approach to preserving performance, adapting to external disturbances and emerging stronger from adversity.

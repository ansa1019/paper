Philip Morris International manages a diversified portfolio of premium, mid-price and low-price brands across four geographic segments and more than 180 markets, often holding the number one or number two market share position, thereby preserving core performance amid external pressures. The company demonstrated its capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning under challenging conditions by implementing factory closures in the Netherlands, Australia and Canada, restructuring its U.S. leaf-purchasing model and terminating distribution agreements in the Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa and Asia segments, resulting in pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs of $535 million ($409 million after tax or $0.26 per share) in 2014 and a total anticipated pre-tax charge of approximately $547 million associated with its social plan with trade unions. In its forward-looking strategy, PMI has allocated incremental spending for its reduced-risk IQOS product—skewed toward the second half of 2015—to support national expansions in Japan and Italy and pilot or national launches in additional markets, while maintaining flexibility in its share repurchase program in response to currency fluctuations. The company further enhances comparability of its core earnings by defining adjusted diluted EPS to exclude asset impairment and exit costs, discrete tax items and unusual items, and relies principally on dividends and debt repayments from subsidiaries to underwrite its liquidity and support ongoing operational continuity in volatile market and currency environments.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we detected and confirmed a breach of our payment data systems that potentially impacted customers at self-checkout systems in the U.S. and Canada, determined that an intruder acquired elevated rights and deployed custom malware to access payment card information of up to 56 million customers, and by September 18, 2014 had eliminated the malware and continued to support law enforcement in identifying responsible parties. We completed a major payment security project that provides enhanced encryption of payment card data at the point of sale in all U.S. stores—scrambling raw payment card information to render it unreadable to unauthorized users—and are rolling out enhanced encryption to Canadian stores and EMV chip-and-pin technology in U.S. stores. In fiscal 2014 we recorded $63 million of pretax expenses related to the data breach, partially offset by $30 million of expected insurance proceeds for costs we believe are reimbursable and probable of recovery, including costs to investigate the breach; provide identity protection services, such as credit monitoring; increase call center staffing; and pay legal and other professional services. We believe settlement negotiations will ensue with card networks, that it is probable we will incur losses that could be material to our consolidated financial condition, and that future costs may include reimbursement liabilities for credit card fraud and reissuance costs, civil litigation, government investigations, enforcement proceedings, legal, investigative and consulting fees, and incremental remediation expenses and capital investments. We maintained $100 million of network security and privacy liability insurance in fiscal 2014 above a $7.5 million deductible and entered a new policy in fiscal 2015 with a $10 million deductible to limit our exposure to similar losses. During fiscal 2014 we also advanced operational resilience through key initiatives anchored on customer service, product authority, disciplined capital allocation, productivity and interconnected retail: deploying our second-generation First Phone handheld customer service tool across stores to simplify operations, enhance associate capabilities and convert online sales in-aisle; leveraging new merchandising assortment planning and pricing tools to review one-third of products per store and better match assortments to local preferences and regulations; repurchasing 80 million shares for $7.0 billion and increasing the quarterly dividend by 26 percent; completing the acquisition of HD Supply Hardware Solutions to strengthen supply chain capabilities; opening new stores in Mexico and Canada to expand our retail footprint; enhancing our website and mobile experience to grow online traffic and conversion rates; piloting Buy Online, Deliver from Store; and opening two of three direct fulfillment centers to provide an optimal balance of cost efficiency and shipping speed. We generated $8.2 billion of cash flow from operations, issued $2.0 billion of long-term debt, and held $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of February 1, 2015; this liquidity, together with our $2.0 billion commercial paper program, back-up credit facility, leases and access to long-term capital markets, is intended to support our operational requirements, capital expenditure programs, dividend payments, share repurchases, data breach obligations and future debt service obligations through the next several fiscal years.

In our MD&A Intuit describes operating within a dynamic and highly competitive industry characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements, where the trend toward connected services is the primary driver of the strategies in all of our businesses. To address environmental perturbations and mitigate seasonality, we announced that we will begin delivering ongoing releases for our future desktop offerings in order to improve the product experience, accommodate operating system updates, and provide access to connected services, a decision that is expected to defer approximately $400 million in revenue to future periods and partially mitigate seasonal variations. Our growth strategy depends upon our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new markets, and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market, increasingly relying on the strength of third-party business relationships and substantial investments of management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and privacy and security capabilities to support business continuity and resilience under internal or external variations. We track non-financial drivers such as customer growth and retention, annualized recurring revenue for our small business online ecosystem, and transaction volume for our payment processing business to assess performance and guide resource allocation. Leveraging strong cash generation from operations, a $500 million unused revolving credit facility, targeted acquisitions of Demandforce and Check Inc., and disciplined capital deployment through share repurchases and dividends, we maintain sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditures, contractual obligations, and strategic initiatives, thereby preserving operational integrity and performance despite constraints and disturbances.

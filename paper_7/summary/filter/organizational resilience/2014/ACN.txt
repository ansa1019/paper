Management continues to monitor the impact of volatility and uncertainty in global economic and geopolitical conditions and seeks to manage costs in order to respond to changing conditions, employing currency protection provisions in customer contracts and hedging programs to manage foreign currency exposure and preserve financial flexibility. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed—adjusting levels of new hiring, involuntary terminations and compensation—to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand, increasing headcount in response to current and projected future demand and assimilating acquired talent. We strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin, while continuously monitoring operating expenses and implementing cost-management actions as appropriate. Our revenue recognition policies involve continuous monitoring and revision of estimated contract revenues and costs under the percentage-of-completion and fixed-fee methods and require the establishment of loss provisions when contract losses become probable, thereby safeguarding the integrity of our performance measures. In managing working capital, we believe available cash balances and operating cash flows will be sufficient to satisfy current and planned needs for at least the next twelve months, supported by committed and uncommitted revolving credit facilities and compliance with covenant terms to ensure operational flexibility. We calculate and provide for income taxes in each jurisdiction through judgmental estimates of exposures, recoverability of deferred tax assets and valuation allowances based on historical and projected taxable income and tax planning strategies. Share repurchases are funded primarily through cash generated from operations, with the amount and timing of repurchase activity determined by factors such as share price, cash balances, debt levels, acquisition opportunities and other strategic demands for cash. Indemnification provisions and master netting arrangements are maintained to mitigate contingent liabilities in client engagements and joint-delivery arrangements. These combined measures support our ability to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning despite external pressures and adapt our resources and operations to maintain continuity and performance under challenging conditions.

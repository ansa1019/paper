Reflecting the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, UPS has consistently adapted its operations by adjusting air capacity and cost structures to align with fluctuating volume mixes and overcapacity trade lanes, leveraging a broad product portfolio and inherent transportation network flexibilities to preserve functioning despite economic pressures. In 2014 the company undertook initiatives to improve delivery network flexibility and capacity, enhance yield management and increase operational efficiency and cost containment across all segments, most notably through facility automation projects and the accelerated deployment of its on-road integrated optimization and navigation system (ORION), which together are expected to increase network capacity and improve operational efficiency, flexibility and reliability. UPS continues to reconfigure its air and ground networks—utilizing new or expanded operating facilities, additional staffing, equipment rentals and extra operating days—to optimize package sorting, delivery density and time-in-transit performance even amid adverse weather, holiday season variability and contract carrier constraints. International package operations have mitigated capacity constraints by modifying their integrated air-ground network and reducing aircraft block hours while processing higher export volumes, and the supply chain & freight segment has applied yield management, resource reconfiguration and productivity gains to absorb greater ltl shipment volumes at improved cost per piece. Across all business units, UPS manages labor resources, safety and claims through ongoing operational safety improvement initiatives, adjusts purchased transportation relationships, invests in network automation and fleet modernization, and pursues productivity improvements and strategic facility expansions to sustain performance under pressure, ensure business continuity and strengthen organizational resilience.

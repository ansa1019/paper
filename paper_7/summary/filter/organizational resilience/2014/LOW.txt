The company enhanced its capacity to maintain performance under challenging conditions by optimizing its sales and operations planning process to improve seasonal planning—including the timing and cadence of product introductions, promotions and staffing—and by ensuring collaboration across logistics, merchandising and marketing functions anchored in customer mindsets; by transforming its business model into an omni-channel platform that enables sales and fulfillment through stores, online, on-site and contact center channels; and by deploying a dedicated customer experience design team to integrate research-driven, feasible and profitable project solutions and dynamically re-purpose store spaces to address evolving shopper preferences. Financial resilience was supported by robust operating cash flows of approximately $4.9 billion in fiscal 2014 and disciplined capital allocation, including $880 million of capital expenditures, $3.9 billion of share repurchases and $822 million of dividends, along with ongoing access to liquidity via a $1.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program subject to defined covenants. Risk mitigation and resource reconfiguration were further evidenced by systematic reviews of inventory for obsolescence and shrinkage, actuarial accruals for self-insured workers’ compensation and liability claims, rigorous impairment analyses of long-lived assets using discounted future cash flows and market comparables, and recognition of lease obligations for store closures; the September 2014 issuance of $1.25 billion of unsecured notes in staggered maturities diversified funding sources and interest-rate exposures. Detailed disclosures of off-balance sheet commitments, contractual obligations and a sustainable debt-to-equity ratio underscore the company’s ability to adjust operating parameters, adapt to external perturbations and preserve system integrity and performance under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

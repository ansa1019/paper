Throughout fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, management has demonstrated adaptive strategies to maintain operational continuity and preserve performance under challenging conditions by continuously monitoring global macroeconomic conditions, assessing opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency, and realigning expenses with revenues through restructuring actions that are expected to yield approximately $46.2 million in annual cost savings to be reinvested in growth initiatives. The company’s systemic commitment to innovation and resource allocation is reflected in its continued investment in research and development—“essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings”—and in strategic divestitures such as the October 31, 2013 sale of the microphone product line for $100.0 million in cash, which generated an $85.4 million gain to reallocate financial resources. In response to environmental disruptions and to reconfigure its trajectory toward future growth, Analog Devices completed the $2.4 billion acquisition of Hittite Microwave Corporation on July 22, 2014—financed through a combination of existing cash on hand and a $2.0 billion term loan facility—recognizing $1.4 billion of goodwill and $666.4 million of intangible assets and establishing a new operating segment to absorb strain from market shifts. The company has preserved liquidity and operational flexibility by maintaining $2.9 billion of cash and short-term investments diversified among high-credit-quality counterparties, continually monitoring credit exposure, and managing working capital—keeping days sales outstanding at 44 days and reducing days cost of sales in inventory back toward normal levels. Capital deployment priorities include the $500.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility to support debt management, acquisitions, capital expenditures and working capital; the repurchase of 137.0 million common shares for $4.8 billion under its ongoing stock repurchase program; and planned fiscal 2015 capital expenditures of $150–165 million for facility upgrades and capacity expansion—all reflecting a strategic perspective on risk mitigation, resource generation, and organizational agility to maintain integrity and performance under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

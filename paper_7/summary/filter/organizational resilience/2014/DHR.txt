Danaher’s MD&A describes a suite of organizational capabilities and strategic actions that support maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including the company’s geographic and industry diversity and the breadth of its products and services, which “help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results.” Management monitors “general economic trends,” key competitors and customer sales “to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future,” and emphasizes the ability to “develop innovative and differentiated new products, services and software,” “continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality,” and “effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated environment” as core to long-term growth and competitive advantage. To respond effectively to rapid technological developments and environmental disruptions, Danaher is “making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to address the rapid pace of technological change” and to “globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources … in order to be responsive to the company's customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the company's operations.” In 2014, “year-over-year sales growth from existing businesses” was led by high-growth markets, even as the company “remains cautious about challenges due to macro-economic and geopolitical uncertainties.” The company undertook restructuring actions “to improve productivity and reduce costs,” yielding incremental year-over-year savings and demonstrating resource reconfiguration to preserve or improve functioning. Acquisitions and divestitures, such as the Nobel Biocare transaction financed from “available cash,” reflect strategic resource allocation and inter-organizational collaboration. Across its segments, Danaher’s offerings help customers “keep their businesses up and running and safeguard their network operations,” provide instrumentation and disinfection systems to “analyze, treat and manage” water quality, and deliver solutions for “environmental compliance, vehicle tracking and fleet management.” The communications business is “actively working with these customers to support” transitions to next-generation network technologies by “increasing research and development investments to bring to market solutions” for evolving requirements. Operating profit improvements across segments are driven by “incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives,” net of growth investments, illustrating a systemic perspective on balancing cost mitigation with innovation. Danaher manages market risks from interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit exposures and commodity prices through a mix of financing instruments—commercial paper, fixed-rate and variable-rate notes, and a $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility providing standby liquidity—to ensure operational continuity and flexibility. The company maintains substantial cash balances, generates “substantial cash from operating activities,” and applies disciplined working capital management, capital expenditure programs and pension funding to sustain system integrity and performance under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

In management’s discussion and analysis, we acknowledge that “factors that might cause those differences include those discussed in ‘risk factors’ and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K,” encompassing macro-economic volatility, sovereign debt concerns and natural disasters that could impair consumer spending and travel demand, and note that “disruptions in the economies of such countries could cause, contribute to or be indicative of deteriorating macro-economic conditions.” We emphasize geographic and service-line diversification, with our international business representing approximately 87% of gross bookings and 94% of operating income, and “intend to continue to invest in adding accommodations available for reservation on our websites,” alongside ongoing “investment in marketing and promotion, technology and personnel within parameters consistent with attempts to improve long-term operating results, even if those expenditures create pressure on operating margins.” To mitigate financial risk, “we generally enter into derivative instruments to minimize the impact of short-term currency fluctuations on our consolidated operating results” and maintain an unsecured revolving credit facility and significant cash and investments denominated in multiple currencies. In response to shifting consumer behavior and market fragmentation, including “widespread adoption of mobile devices,” we have adapted our distribution strategies—shifting emphasis toward express deals® and mobile applications—and pursued “strategic alternatives … in the form of, among other things, mergers and acquisitions,” notably Kayak and OpenTable, to reconfigure our service platform and resource base, while recognizing “seasonality … highest levels of profitability in the second and third quarters” and that “we have experienced pressure on operating margins as we prioritize initiatives that drive growth.” We continually assess the risk of emerging regulatory, technological and competitive challenges and recognize that “if the investments we intend to make … are unsuccessful in growing … our business … we may incur an impairment,” ensuring continual alignment of resource allocation, operational flexibility and strategic foresight to preserve integrity and performance under challenging conditions.

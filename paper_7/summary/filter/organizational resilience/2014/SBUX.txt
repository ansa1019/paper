Starbucks’ Management Discussion and Analysis highlights the continued strength of its global business model and its disciplined execution of new growth initiatives, driven by sales leverage, lower commodity costs and targeted product innovation, underscoring its capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under varying market conditions. The company actively manages cash and investments—comprising government treasury securities, corporate bonds, mortgage and asset-backed securities and offshore holdings—to internally fund operating needs, service debt obligations, return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and pursue strategic acquisitions such as the two-step tender offer for Starbucks Japan, thereby demonstrating operational continuity and adaptability. Its $750 million revolving credit facility, $1 billion commercial paper program and multiple senior note issuances, all subject to financial covenants, reflect proactive risk mitigation and structured capital flexibility. Starbucks further hedges commodity price risk through fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed green coffee contracts and financial derivatives under its market price risk management policy, and enters into foreign currency derivatives to reduce cash flow volatility on non-US-dollar transactions. The prompt payment and full extinguishment of the $2.8 billion Kraft arbitration liability in fiscal 2014 illustrates rapid recovery and resource reconfiguration. Despite the arbitration outflow, operating cash flows remained robust—$607.8 million in fiscal 2014—supporting capital expenditures of approximately $1.2 billion and ensuring sufficient liquidity for ongoing store expansion, systems investments and manufacturing capacity, while maintaining compliance with debt covenants and preserving off-balance sheet commitments through operating leases and purchase obligations. These combined measures underpin Starbucks’ financial resilience, risk management and ability to maintain performance under challenging conditions.

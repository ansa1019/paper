We have implemented ongoing cost‐containment and restructuring programs—recognizing severance costs and asset impairment charges related to the closure and sale of manufacturing sites—to realign our cost structure and global workforce, preserve operational continuity and sustain performance under challenging conditions.  We manage research and development spending across a diversified portfolio of approximately 55 potential new drugs in human testing or under regulatory review, thereby ensuring that a delay or termination of any one project will not materially disrupt overall R&D investment levels or long‐term innovation trajectories.  Through strategic collaborations and acquisitions—such as the acquisition of Novartis Animal Health and partnerships with Boehringer Ingelheim, AstraZeneca and others—we have augmented our global manufacturing and research infrastructure, expanded our product portfolio and commercial presence, and strengthened our ability to absorb external pressures and emerge stronger.  We maintain inventory and supply‐chain resilience by monitoring wholesaler stocking levels to approximately one month’s supply, establishing robust returns, rebate and discount reserves based on historical return rates and channel inventory, and adjusting these reserves to reflect patent expiries and market dynamics.  A proactive risk‐management framework employing derivative financial instruments—interest rate swaps, foreign currency forwards and options—and committed bank credit facilities is used to hedge market exposures, limit the impact of interest rate and currency fluctuations on earnings and cash flows, and ensure access to short‐ and long‐term liquidity.  We periodically review long‐lived assets and goodwill for impairment whenever indicators arise, applying discounted‐cash‐flow analyses to adjust carrying values and safeguard financial integrity.  Contingent milestone and royalty arrangements in our collaborative R&D agreements afford us discretion to terminate or reconfigure programs in response to clinical or regulatory outcomes, thereby preserving resource flexibility and adapting to disruptive events.  We establish reserves for product liability and legal contingencies based on probabilistic assessments of claims and insurance coverage, and recognize only those tax positions deemed more likely than not to be sustained, all to maintain organizational health and performance under regulatory and legal uncertainties.

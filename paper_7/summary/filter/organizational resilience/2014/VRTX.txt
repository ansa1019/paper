Vertex’s management describes the use of precision medicine approaches to create transformative drugs for serious diseases in specialty markets while maintaining financial strength and dedicating substantial management and other resources to its research programs, thereby balancing the risks inherent in drug discovery and development and distributing risk across diverse therapeutic areas. The company closely monitors the results of discovery, research, clinical trials and nonclinical studies and frequently evaluates its development programs in light of new data and scientific, business and commercial insights, with the objective of balancing risk and potential, which can result in abrupt changes in focus and priorities as additional understanding emerges. A corporate compliance program designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk supports its organizational health, complemented by targeted investments to secure and maintain reimbursement levels from third-party payors and government programs. To sustain operations under internal and external pressures, Vertex relies on its existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash flows from product sales, has secured a $300 million credit facility with the option for additional borrowings, and considers strategic collaborative agreements, equity and debt offerings, development milestones, royalties, asset sales and other financial transactions as possible sources of liquidity, while acknowledging that covenants and regulatory uncertainties may constrain its financing flexibility. Periodic assessments of inventory and in-process research and development assets lead to write-downs of excess, obsolete or impaired assets to preserve system integrity and performance, and restructuring charges relating to facility relocations and headcount reductions demonstrate its capacity to reconfigure operations and reallocate resources. Revenue recognition and tax accounting policies incorporate significant estimates and judgments that are continuously reassessed, reflecting the company’s commitment to maintaining integrity, adaptability and performance under a range of regulatory, competitive, market and operational disruptions.

During fiscal 2015, we continued to generate strong cash flows, allowing us to return value to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases while reinvesting in our business by adding new stores, remodeling existing ones and strengthening our infrastructure to support our next level of growth, demonstrating our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under challenging conditions. We routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of our divisions, effectively managing external pressures and preserving our operational integrity. We manage working capital through disciplined timing of inventory receipts and payments, which favorably impacted cash flows, and we maintain a mix of internally generated funds, short-term bank borrowings, commercial paper and committed credit facilities to ensure sufficient liquidity and operational flexibility. Capital expenditures of $911.5 million for new stores, renovations and investments in offices and distribution centers reflect our commitment to resource allocation and business continuity, and our planned $975 million investment in fiscal 2016, funded by internally generated funds, underscores our proactive approach to supporting growth and resilience. On the financing side, we issued $750 million of 2.75% notes to refinance higher-cost debt, redeemed $400 million of 4.20% notes and maintained our stock repurchase program—spending $1.7 billion to repurchase 27.7 million shares—while our dividend policy, including a 20% increase in quarterly dividends to $0.21 per share for fiscal 2016, reflects our strategic agility and financial resourcefulness. We continually assess our exposure to foreign currency translation and mark-to-market adjustments on derivatives, adjust our reserves for former operations and uncertain tax positions as warranted, and evaluate our contractual obligations, including operating leases and purchase commitments, to ensure that our capital and operational strategies maintain integrity and performance in the face of environmental disturbances and market volatility.

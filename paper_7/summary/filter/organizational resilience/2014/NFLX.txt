Management has demonstrated the ability to grow domestic streaming contribution margin from 17 percent in 2012 to 27 percent in 2014, reflecting an underlying resilience in cost management as revenue growth outpaced content and marketing spending. Investments in content and marketing associated with the international streaming segment will continue to fluctuate dependent upon the number of international territories in which our streaming service is offered and the timing of the launch of new territories, and as a result of having to build a member base from zero, such investments are larger initially relative to revenues, in particular as new territories are launched. We utilize both our own and third-party content delivery networks to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the Internet, supporting operational flexibility and service continuity under growing delivery demands. We expect to continue to increase domestic contribution margins over the next several years even with lower membership growth, demonstrating operational adaptability. We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating and investing activities excluding the non-operational cash flows from purchases, maturities and sales of short-term investments, and consider it an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities, thereby preserving financial flexibility under variable payment terms for content agreements. Our primary uses of cash include content acquisition and licensing, streaming delivery, marketing programs and payroll, with payment terms for certain content agreements requiring more upfront cash payments relative to expense and, therefore, future investments could impact our liquidity and require strategic resource allocation. In the contractual obligations footnote, streaming content obligations increased $2.2 billion from $7.3 billion as of December 31, 2013 to $9.5 billion as of December 31, 2014 primarily due to multi-year commitments associated with our latest market launches in Europe and the continued expansion of our exclusive and original programming, and because the amount for unknown future titles is not reasonably estimable, those obligations are expected to be significant and the expected timing of payments could range from less than one year to more than five years, reflecting the complexity and uncertainty inherent in our content strategy. We review factors impacting the amortization of the content library, including historical and estimated viewing patterns, on a regular basis, and acknowledge that our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment and that changes in our estimates could have a significant impact on our future results of operations. Liquidity and capital resources are managed through cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1,608.5 million as of December 31, 2014 and long-term debt issuances, including $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.750 percent senior notes due 2024, and our ability to obtain any additional financing depends on our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing, thereby highlighting the organizationâ€™s strategic foresight and risk mitigation approach to sustaining performance under evolving capital market conditions.

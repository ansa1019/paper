T-Mobile’s MD&A details a series of strategic investments, operational adjustments and financing arrangements that collectively support the company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite competitive, technological and financial pressures.  The company “substantially completed the process of upgrading our network to LTE, which provides our customers with the fastest nationwide LTE services” and expanded coverage from 200 million people at year-end 2013 to 265 million as of December 31, 2014, with a target of 300 million by the end of 2015, while incurring “network modernization” costs—including accelerated depreciation and “costs related to decommissioning of the MetroPCS CDMA network and certain other redundant cell sites”—and planning an additional $500 million to $600 million of decommissioning in 2015.  Service innovation under the Un-carrier proposition has aggressively addressed customer pain points through phases that include contract freedom, test drive, music freedom, Wi-Fi un-leashed and data stash, driving “improvements in branded postpaid net customer additions and churn” via “churn reduction initiatives to improve customer experience” and ongoing efforts to “listen and respond to our customers, refine and improve the Un-carrier proposition, and deliver the best value experience in the industry.”  The April 2013 business combination with MetroPCS exemplifies an organizational change process that reconfigured the customer base, expanded prepaid markets and integrated network assets to strengthen competitive positioning.  Liquidity management and risk mitigation are supported by multiple sources of funding—“cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and the issuance of common and preferred stock, the sale of certain service receivables related to a factoring arrangement, and financing arrangements of vendor payables which effectively extend payment terms”—including a two-year factoring arrangement with a $640 million funding limit and $982 million of preferred stock proceeds, while maintaining compliance with all restrictive debt covenants.  Proactive resource allocation is further evidenced by spectrum license acquisitions—$4.8 billion of 700 MHz A-block, AWS and PCS licenses in 2014 (covering 150 million people) and agreements for an additional $0.5 billion of licenses—and a commitment to “seek to opportunistically acquire additional spectrum in private party transactions” to extend LTE coverage to new markets.  Capital expenditures are forecast at $4.4 billion to $4.7 billion in 2015 for property and equipment related primarily to network modernization, demonstrating operational flexibility and forward-looking resilience in maintaining system integrity and performance under evolving environmental perturbations.

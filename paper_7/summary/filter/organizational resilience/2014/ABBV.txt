Since becoming an independent, publicly‐traded company on January 1, 2013, AbbVie has sought to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions by allocating resources and reconfiguring its operations to absorb strain from events such as loss of exclusivity in its lipid franchise and the onset of generic competition; in 2014, the company grew worldwide net sales by 6 percent to $20.0 billion and delivered fully diluted earnings per share of $1.10 despite a $748 million revenue decline from generic entry, reflecting operational flexibility, favorable product mix, cost efficiencies, and the preservation of system integrity.  AbbVie generated $3.5 billion of operating cash flows, net of $1.8 billion of transaction and financing-related costs associated with the terminated proposed combination with Shire, enabling continued funding of emerging mid- and late-stage pipeline assets, expanded indications for Humira and the launch of Viekira Pak, as well as strategic licensing and collaboration arrangements—including a $750 million research and development collaboration with Calico and a $275 million agreement with Infinity—that bolster innovation, risk mitigation and the company’s capacity to respond effectively to external pressures.  In managing its separation from Abbott Laboratories and establishing back-office infrastructure outside the United States, AbbVie entered into transition services agreements for information technology, quality assurance and administrative support, incurred incremental stand-alone costs and replaced its $2.0 billion revolving credit facility with a $3.0 billion facility to preserve liquidity and financial resilience.  The company’s strategic initiatives in 2015—driven by continued Humira growth, new product launches, supply chain efficiencies and expanded market access in emerging economies—along with ongoing investment in immunology, oncology, virology, renal, neurological and women’s health research and development, demonstrate a systemic perspective and future orientation designed to preserve or improve functioning, maintain operating margins and sustain competitive advantage while confronting volatility, regulatory demands and environmental disruptions.

We maintain substantial liquidity in the form of global core liquid assets and other unencumbered securities and cash, supported by comprehensive business continuity and contingency funding plans, scenario analyses and stress‐testing programs designed to ensure maintenance of positive adjustment under severely stressed domestic and global market conditions. Quarterly balance sheet planning aligns projected asset compositions with expected secured and unsecured funding sources, while daily monitoring of key metrics—assets and liabilities, aged inventory, limit utilization, capital usage and liquidity projections—enables proactive resource allocation and operational flexibility in response to evolving market, credit or funding disruptions. Governance of these efforts rests with senior management and firmwide risk, finance, operational risk, client standards and investment policy committees, which set economic, market, credit and liquidity limits, review new activities and emerging risks, validate models and backtest value‐at‐risk and stress‐loss scenarios, and approve strategic initiatives to preserve system integrity and firm performance. Credit exposures are managed through counterparty ratings, exposure limits, netting arrangements, collateral agreements and hedges, while market‐making inventories are hedged, diversified and capped by var and stress limits. Operational risk management employs rigorous policies, controls, incident reporting, root‐cause analyses and periodic audits to mitigate process failures, technology disruptions and external threats. Capital planning and regulatory stress‐testing under ccar, dfast and recovery and resolution frameworks ensure that capital and liquidity buffers remain adequate to support business continuity, crisis response, strategic adaptation and organizational resilience across legal entities and business units under both normal and extreme conditions.

In our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we emphasize that we empower enterprises, service providers, and government entities to secure all users, applications, data, networks and devices with comprehensive visibility and context continuously across all locations by delivering cybersecurity products that span hardware, software, and cloud-based modules, including ML-powered next-generation firewalls, virtual and containerized appliances, and SaaS-delivered security services. We believe our portfolio’s consistent Pan-OS functionality across physical, virtual and container platforms provides a coordinated set of capabilities that enhances operational efficiency by replacing siloed point solutions and reducing total cost of ownership. Our subscription offerings provide end-customers with near real-time access to the latest antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering and malware prevention capabilities across networks, endpoints and the cloud, reflecting our focus on information management capability by tailoring accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security and connectivity to evolving business needs. To sustain growth and reinforce our competitive position, we continue to invest in our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to efficiently manage headcount, capital and processes, and in response to COVID-19, we instituted a global work-from-home policy and provided technology to employees, end-customers and partners to enable remote operations with minimal disruption. During fiscal 2020, we introduced Pan-OS 10.0 with over 70 new features, new ML-powered firewalls and our Cortex XSOAR solution for security orchestration and automation with integrated threat intelligence, and completed strategic acquisitions—Zingbox for IoT security acceleration, Aporeto for cloud-native security platform enhancement, and CloudGenix for strengthening our SASE offering—thereby extending our technology resources in support of business strategies and digital transformation initiatives.

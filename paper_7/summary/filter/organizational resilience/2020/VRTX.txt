In responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company adjusted its business operations by enabling a majority of employees to work remotely and by implementing a phased, site-specific approach to assess employee site access, continuously monitoring local pandemic trends and government guidance while maintaining data protection and privacy compliance across its information systems. The Company closely monitors and evaluates the results of discovery, preclinical and clinical activities and frequently re-allocates resources and refines priorities as new scientific, business and commercial insights emerge. In its revenue recognition practices, management forecasts payor mix and estimates government and private payor rebates, chargebacks, discounts and fees based on historical and current data, defers consideration subject to annual reimbursement limits under government-capped contracts and updates transaction prices upon definitive agreements for early access programs in France. The Company also reassesses deferred tax asset valuation allowances by weighing positive and negative evidence regarding future profitability and applies probability-weighted discounted cash flow models to measure contingent consideration liabilities, reflecting the integration of data analytics, information reliability and timely decision-making processes to align financial reporting and strategic resource allocation with continually evolving business needs.

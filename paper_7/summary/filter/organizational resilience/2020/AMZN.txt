Amazon’s management discussion highlights that information technology capabilities underpin its strategy to enhance customer experience, operational efficiency, and business transformation by investing heavily in technology infrastructure and content development.  The company’s fixed costs include building and running data centers and technology infrastructure—primarily to support AWS—and enhancing online stores, web services, electronic devices, digital offerings, and fulfillment networks.  In 2020, spending on technology and content increased as Amazon added computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees, reflecting its focus on research and development of new and existing products and services, system cross-functionality across geographic expansions, and process efficiency improvements.  Infrastructure costs encompass servers, networking equipment, and data center depreciation, and the company’s change in the estimated useful life of servers reduced depreciation expense, demonstrating dynamic alignment of IT assets with evolving business needs.  Amazon believes that advances in processing power, data storage and analytics, wireless connectivity, and artificial intelligence and machine learning will continue to improve internet ubiquity and user experience, and to leverage these trends it invests in AWS’s on-demand compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning services.  These investments, allocated to segments based on usage, support a broad set of customer and enterprise offerings and illustrate how IT resources, capabilities, and governance are mobilized to coordinate internal processes and interfirm transactions, drive innovation, and sustain competitive advantage.

The management’s discussion and analysis does not specifically address the evolution or deployment of information technology capabilities, digital infrastructure or information management systems; the only explicit reference to technology appears in Geico’s underwriting expense discussion, where “higher employee-related, advertising and technology costs” are noted, and in the description of pandemic-driven business continuity measures—such as work-from-home arrangements and remote operating practices—implemented to protect employees and customers, while all other sections focus on financial performance, underwriting and investment results, operational efficiencies, capital allocation, and market dynamics without direct mention of IT capability or information management functionality.

Amgen’s disclosures reflect a reliance on timely, accurate information and systems that enable coordination of its assets and processes in support of business strategies and risk management. For example, its forward‐looking statements are based on “information available to our management at the time the statements are made,” and the company continuously monitors key operational metrics—such as clinical trial enrollment on an institution-by-institution basis, inventory levels at wholesalers via data from third parties, and accruals for rebates, chargebacks and returns—by applying historical experience, contractual terms and forecasted customer patterns. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, “a significant number of our employees have been working remotely” and “remote working arrangements have not significantly affected our ability to maintain critical business operations,” underscoring the firm’s capacity to leverage connectivity and information management tools. Its hedging activities employ interest rate forward curves and cross-currency swap contracts to model and mitigate foreign currency exchange risks, while its investment policy and capital allocation processes balance liquidity, risk and strategic transactions through disciplined, data-driven analyses. These practices collectively demonstrate Amgen’s competence in mobilizing and integrating information‐based resources—spanning data analytics, monitoring systems, and governance frameworks—to support operational flexibility, organizational objectives and competitive resilience.

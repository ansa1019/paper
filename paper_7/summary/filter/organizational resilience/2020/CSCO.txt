Cisco designs and sells a broad range of technologies that have been powering the Internet since 1984 and is integrating intent-based technologies across networking, security, collaboration, applications and the cloud, “designed to help our customers manage more users, devices and things connecting to their networks” and “provide customers with a highly secure, intelligent platform for their digital business.” We continued to make progress in the transition of our business model to increased software and subscriptions and remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio to support digital organizations and transform infrastructure, expand applications and analytics, address security needs, and empower teams through “highly secure, software-defined, automated and intelligent platforms.” The COVID-19 pandemic has “driven organizations across the globe to digitize their operations and support remote workforces at a faster speed and greater scale than ever before,” and in response most of our global workforce is working from home under a long-standing flexible work policy as we “build the technologies that allow organizations to stay connected, secure and productive.” We introduced free offers and trials for our Webex and security technologies as customers dramatically shifted entire workforces to be remote and announced a Cisco Capital business resiliency program to provide financing solutions and support business continuity. We continue to invest in R&D “in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion,” and where we are unable to enter markets internally we may “purchase or license technology from other businesses, or … partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal R&D,” while our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position “allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies.” The increase in deferred product revenue was “primarily due to increased deferrals related to our recurring software offerings,” reflecting our shift to subscription and SaaS models.

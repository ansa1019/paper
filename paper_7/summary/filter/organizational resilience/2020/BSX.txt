During the COVID-19 pandemic, Boston Scientific mobilized and deployed its digital infrastructure and IT-based resources to support remote work and business continuity by implementing business continuity plans that included establishing a medical advisory group, leveraging work-from-home infrastructure to facilitate social distancing, and accelerating capabilities to provide remote physician support; it also instituted a global crisis management team focused on protecting employees and customers, optimizing operations and securing the supply chain, and established controls and procedures to escalate enterprise-level issues—including cybersecurity matters—to management and the board, ensuring that known cyber risks and incidents that could materially affect operations, financial reporting or reputation are promptly reported and addressed.

ADP, as a leading global provider of cloud-based human capital management technology solutions, has continued to process payroll and tax obligations and deliver comprehensive HCM services through scalable IT architecture even amid the COVID-19 pandemic by executing its business continuity plan to shift over 98% of associates to remote or off-site work locations, enabling uninterrupted service delivery and virtual engagement of its sales force. During fiscal 2020, ADP implemented over 1,000 feature changes to its products in response to more than 2,000 legislative updates across 60 countries, rolled out a suite of tools and reports—including an employer preparedness toolkit and PPP reporting capabilities utilized by approximately 400,000 clients—to provide accurate, timely information and analytic insights, and initiated a digital implementation and servicing initiative leveraging the capabilities showcased at its February 2020 innovation day. Investments in systems development and programming increased due to the costs of developing, supporting and maintaining its product portfolio, including capitalization of strategic projects and next-generation platforms, while depreciation and amortization rose with internally developed software and acquired intangible assets. ADP further committed to enhancing research and development and driving meaningful transformation of its operations, employing real-time macro-trend indicators and analytics to inform decision-making, optimizing processes through workforce and procurement transformation initiatives, and sustaining a robust digital infrastructure and agile IT deployment to support client needs and long-term strategic objectives.

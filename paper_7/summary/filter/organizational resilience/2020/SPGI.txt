In the first quarter of 2020, we changed our allocation methodology for allocating our centrally managed technology-related expenses to our reportable segments to more accurately reflect each segment’s respective usage, with prior-year amounts reclassified to conform with current presentation, and selling and general expenses in 2020 include a technology-related impairment charge of $11 million. Market Intelligence’s data management solutions encompass integrated bulk data feeds and application programming interfaces that can be customized, and our purchase commitments include contracts for information-technology outsourcing and certain enterprise-wide information-technology software licensing and maintenance. As part of our operations strategy, we are improving end-user productivity and experience by providing our employees with the tools and processes to better serve our customers; reimagining our work environment by continuing to standardize our technology and encouraging employee participation in the reshaping of where we work, how we work and how we serve; advancing our risk culture by maturing risk management and compliance processes and our cyber security posture; and utilizing our innovation teams and latest technology to maintain our commitment to advancing our shared data processes and technical capabilities. Throughout the year we also experienced higher technology costs reflecting investments in technology infrastructure and systems to support our global businesses.

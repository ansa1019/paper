Management underscores its evolving IT capability through continuous investments in digital technologies and infrastructure, driving the automation of existing processes and creation of efficient, digitized workflows that span disparate departments, systems and processes. It primarily delivers its software via the Internet as a service through a consumer-grade interface, enabling rapid deployment of packaged offerings and bespoke applications, while enabling customers to self-host or engage third parties for hosting, with data backup, disaster recovery and regular updates integrated into its subscription model. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, it released a suite of emergency response and safe workplace applications, transitioned events to digital formats and enabled remote work protocols without disrupting its financial reporting systems, internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures. Concurrently, the company continues to invest in service development, R&D-hosted environments, data center capacity (including colocation, hardware, connectivity and software), IntegrationHub, App Engine, analytics and security to ensure data accuracy, timeliness, reliability, confidentiality, connectivity and scalability, leveraging IT resources, governance, management skills and process understanding to enhance operational flexibility, support evolving business strategies, coordinate assets and internal processes and sustain competitive advantage and long-term growth.

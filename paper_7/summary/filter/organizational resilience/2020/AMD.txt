During the year, we supported those employees who worked from home so that they could be productive and monitored demand signals as we adjusted our supply chain requirements based on changing customer needs and demands, and we assessed our product schedules and roadmaps to make any adjustments that may be necessary to support remote working requirements and address the geographic and market demand shifts caused by COVID-19. In May 2020, we announced the global availability of the AMD Ryzen™ Pro 4000 series mobile family for commercial notebooks built with enterprise-grade AMD Pro technologies, which deliver a set of security and manageability features for enterprise IT deployments. In October 2020, we announced the AMD EPYC™ processor-based Azure Dav4, Eav4, Easv4 and Lsv2 virtual machines to improve real-time analysis on large volumes of data streaming from applications, websites and more, and in November 2020 we introduced our data center graphics processor, the AMD Instinct™ MI100 GPU accelerator, the first accelerator to use the new AMD CDNA architecture dedicated to HPC workloads. Other long-term liabilities primarily represent future fixed and non-cancellable cash payments associated with software technology and licenses and IP licenses.

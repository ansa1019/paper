Qualcomm develops and commercializes foundational technologies and products used in mobile devices and other wireless products across its QCT semiconductor and QTL licensing segments and makes strategic investments through its QSI segment, which includes nonreportable initiatives such as its cloud AI inference processing initiative and other technology and service programs. Its product portfolio—comprising mobile station modems, radio frequency, power management and wireless connectivity integrated chipsets—is supported by substantial research and development expenditures, including significant investment in 5G and application processor technologies, and beginning in fiscal 2019 the company reallocated certain early‐stage research costs between its QCT and QTL segments to better align resource deployment with business priorities. The company’s manufacturing relationships with foundry suppliers and assembly and test service providers, along with supply chain planning to ramp capacity for 5G demand, underscore its operational flexibility and coordination of internal processes and assets. In fiscal 2020, Qualcomm recorded royalties under multi-year global patent license agreements with major OEMs—Huawei, Apple, Oppo and Vivo—while its adoption of new revenue recognition guidance enabled timely estimation and recognition of sales-based royalties based on preliminary royalty estimates provided by licensees. Looking forward, Qualcomm expects 5G deployments and device launches to drive growth and transformation in emerging device categories and industries such as automotive and IoT, creating new business models and services, and intends to increase its R&D investment, workforce capabilities and strategic resource allocation to support evolving digital infrastructure, maintain competitive positioning amid intense market dynamics and address regulatory and environmental uncertainties.

The firmâ€™s enterprise response framework invokes centralized management of crisis events, regular meetings of key executives to drive decisions, communications and consistency across all businesses and functions, and coordination with global, regional and local authorities, all supported by integrated protocols, processes and IT resources. Through its technology investments and IT governance practices, Bank of America mobilizes IT-based resources in combination with other organizational capabilities to optimize processes, manage risk, tailor information delivery with appropriate accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access, and reconfigure resources and capabilities in support of changing business needs and strategic priorities.

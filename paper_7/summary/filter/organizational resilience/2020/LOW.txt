In 2020, the company rapidly rolled out curbside pickup in the first quarter to enhance our omni-channel capabilities, launched mobile check-in for curbside pickup along with an internal order-picking app to improve associatesâ€™ speed and accuracy in fulfilling orders, and began the launch of touchless buy-online-pickup-in-store (BOPIS) lockers; we also continued to enhance our mobile app to improve the customer pickup experience, including geofencing technology that alerts our stores when customers are on their way to pick up their orders. In addition, we completed the re-platforming of lowes.com to the cloud which greatly improved site stability and functionality, allowing us to achieve triple-digit online sales growth for the year. These digital technology investments were funded by strong cash flows from operating activities, supplemented by short- and long-term borrowings that provided ample liquidity to fund our operations while allowing us to make strategic investments in our omni-channel capabilities to support long-term growth. Capital expenditures of $1.8 billion in 2020 included facility repairs, merchandising resets and replacements of IT and store equipment, and in the fourth quarter we launched a new pro customer relationship management (CRM) tool which provides our pro desk with tools to manage, grow and retain our pro customers through consistent and data-driven selling actions.

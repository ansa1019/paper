Starbucks reports that it continues to invest in technologies and innovations to elevate the customer and partner experience and to drive long-term growth, including focused efforts to expand contactless customer experiences and digital capabilities, and notes that its recovery plans—together with digital enhancements and beverage innovation—position the company to regain its pre-pandemic momentum; likewise, in its corporate and other segment, the company indicates that lower performance-based compensation and the lapping of prior stock awards were partially offset by incremental strategic investments in technology.

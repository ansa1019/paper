The MD&A discloses that, as part of merger-related integration activities, the Company has incurred “integration costs to achieve efficiencies in network, retail, information technology and back office operations,” and in unifying the Sprint and T-Mobile businesses “we combined our retail operations and rebranded thousands of Sprint stores to T-Mobile stores while implementing the tools and systems across our distribution footprint to serve all customers in all stores.” In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company “implemented remote working arrangements for many employees with a significant portion of our internal and global care employees transitioned to a work-from-home environment” and encouraged its corporate and administrative workforce to work remotely, reflecting its ability to deploy IT resources for business continuity. The Company further highlights its coordination with multiple spectrum holders and the FCC to “successfully deploy additional 600 MHz spectrum on a temporary basis, effectively doubling total 600 MHz LTE capacity across the nation” and affirms that it “is working to keep our network fully operational as an essential service to first responders, 911 communications and our customers and continue to expand our 5G network,” underscoring its ongoing investments in technology infrastructure and network capabilities.

Online sales, which consist of sales generated online through our websites for products picked up in our stores or delivered to customer locations, represented 14.4 % of net sales and grew by approximately 86 % during fiscal 2020 as customers continued to leverage our digital platforms for their shopping needs; the increase in comparable sales reflected execution of our strategic efforts to drive an enhanced interconnected experience in both the physical and digital worlds; in adapting to operations in a COVID-19 environment, we shifted store support operations to remote or virtual, implemented changes to store operating hours and customer capacity measures, and rolled out curbside pickup at our stores; we have been able to mitigate supply chain pressures due to the benefits from our strategic investments and by working cross-functionally and partnering with our suppliers to make real-time adjustments to our product assortments, introduce alternative products or reduce assortments to the most popular selections; we believe that the investments we have made in recent years in our stores, interconnected and digital assets, associates, supply chain, and merchandising organization have allowed us to quickly adapt to shifts in customer needs and behaviors and the fluid circumstances created by the pandemic.

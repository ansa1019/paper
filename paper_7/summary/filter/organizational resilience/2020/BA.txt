In July 2020, we announced our business transformation efforts to assess our business across five key pillars—infrastructure, overhead and organization, portfolio and investments, supply chain health and operational excellence—utilizing a lower production rate environment to transform and improve our business processes. Within the infrastructure pillar we are assessing our overall facility requirements in light of reduced demand in our commercial businesses and remote and virtual work opportunities for large numbers of our workforce, and we continue to have large numbers of employees working from home, measures that have reduced overall productivity and adversely impacted our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in 2020. The operational excellence pillar is focused on improving performance, enhancing quality and reducing rework; for example, our information technology teams are evaluating opportunities to form or expand strategic partnerships with vendors that allow us to simplify and optimize our operations, and reduce overall costs. We provide operators of our commercial airplanes with information services and systems and technical data and documents to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation, and in our global services segment airlines are using data analytics to plan flight operations and predictive maintenance to improve their productivity and efficiency.

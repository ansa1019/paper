The company’s da Vinci surgical systems operate as an integrated ecosystem of consoles, imaging electronics, patient-side carts and computational hardware and software designed to work together to deliver consistent functionality and user experiences, and the vast majority of installed systems are internet-connected—enabling system logs to be accessed even for units without direct connectivity—to provide data on utilization, installed base and system performance that management leverages, alongside contract and customer discussion data, for financial and operational decision-making, forecasting and period-to-period comparisons. Training and support capabilities—including intuitive simulation products, telepresence remote case observation and telementoring tools and dual-console collaboration—further illustrate the firm’s mobilization of technology resources and connectivity to enhance internal processes, organizational learning and the coordination of assets and interfirm relationships. In February 2020, the acquisition of Orpheus Medical deepened and expanded the company’s integrated informatics platform, bringing hospitals information technology connectivity and expertise in processing and archiving surgical videos, thereby extending the firm’s ability to acquire, deploy and reconfigure IT-based resources to support evolving business strategies, data management needs and value-chain integration.

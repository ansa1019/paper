During 2020, management reinforced its emphasis on technology-enabled resources by investing in new clinical and administrative information and management systems to support health management services and care coordination and by working together with clinicians to leverage our data and analytics to provide the necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes for patients. The growing adoption of aligned contractual arrangements and performance-based payment models has created needs for information systems capable of coordinating care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for targeted investments in our Optum platformâ€™s infrastructure and software. Within Optum Insight, revenue and earnings growth were driven primarily by expansion in technology and managed services, partially offset by COVID-19-related volume declines in certain services. Our capital deployment priorities included purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software to enhance our operational flexibility and support evolving business strategies. In addition, we expanded benefit coverage in areas such as telemedicine and pharmacy benefits, simplified administrative practices and accelerated payments to care providers, further leveraging our digital delivery capabilities to address shifting consumer needs and market dynamics.

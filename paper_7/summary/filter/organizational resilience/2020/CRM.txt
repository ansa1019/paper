We report that our Customer 360 platform delivers a single source of truth by connecting customer data across systems, applications and devices to support selling, service, marketing and commerce in an all-digital, work-from-anywhere era, reflecting our information management capability to provide data with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access tailored to changing business needs. Since 1999, we have pioneered innovations in cloud, mobile, social, analytics and artificial intelligence to transform business processes and enable competitive advantage, and we regularly evaluate and complete acquisitions and other investments—including MuleSoft, Tableau, Vlocity and the pending Slack transaction—to expand our technology portfolio, interfirm transaction capabilities and ecosystem integration. To scale our enterprise cloud computing services and continuously evolve our security measures, we have increased our data center, customer support and professional services headcount by 18 percent and our research and development headcount by 11 percent since fiscal 2020, invested in additional development and test data-center capacity, capitalized costs to obtain customer contracts and amortized commissions over a four-year average period, and expect further employee-related costs, technology infrastructure enhancements and cybersecurity program investments in future periods. We leverage our professional services organization to facilitate customer adoption of our offerings, reinvest a significant portion of income from operations to drive multi-cloud adoption, deepen enterprise and international penetration and vertical software solutions, and offer new digital capabilities such as Work.com and Vaccine Cloud, thereby mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other assets to support and enhance our business strategies, operational flexibility and firm performance.

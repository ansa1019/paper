Following the closing of the Allergan acquisition, AbbVie implemented an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization and realize more than $2 billion of expected annual cost synergies over a three-year period (approximately 50 % in R&D, 40 % in SG&A and 10 % in cost of products sold), reflecting its ability to reconfigure and mobilize organizational resources in support of strategic objectives; AbbVie continues to closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources around the world to help ensure that patients receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines, demonstrating coordinated oversight of internal processes and interfirm transactions; operating cash flows in 2020 were favorably impacted by higher net revenues of the combined company and the timing of working capital cash flows, partially offset by acquisition-related cash expenses, underscoring the firm’s capacity to allocate financial resources and adjust to evolving market conditions; in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, AbbVie partnered with global authorities to support experimental use of multiple AbbVie assets and entered into a collaboration with Harbour BioMed, Utrecht University and Erasmus Medical Center to develop a novel antibody therapeutic, exemplifying strategic resource integration and external relationship management; the presentation of year-over-year net revenue changes “at constant currency rates” provides information on the change in net revenues assuming foreign currency exchange rates had not changed and can facilitate analysis of the company’s results of operations, illustrating its information management capability to tailor financial reporting for stakeholder decision-making; and AbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations, regularly communicates with customers regarding receivable balances and establishes an allowance for credit losses equal to the estimate of future losses over the contractual life of accounts receivable, reflecting its processes for capturing and delivering timely, reliable information in support of operational and financial decision-making.

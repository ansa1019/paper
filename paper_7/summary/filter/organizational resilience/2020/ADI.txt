The Company’s categorization of revenue by end market relies on evolving data systems for capturing and tracking a variety of data points, including technical product characteristics, “sold-to” and “ship-to” customer information and the end-customer application into which its products are incorporated, and as these systems and methodologies evolve and improve, the Company reclassifies prior-period revenue by end market to reflect updated classifications. Sales arrangements leverage digital infrastructure with product sales conducted through a direct sales force, third-party distributors, independent sales representatives and via the Company’s website. The adoption of new revenue accounting standards in fiscal 2019 and of ASU 2016-02 for leases in fiscal 2020 necessitated revisions to revenue recognition and lease accounting policies and related systems, requiring the identification and tracking of performance obligations, allocation of transaction prices and recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Contract accounting processes employ data-driven estimates and judgmental assumptions—such as historical return rates, price protection discounts and variable consideration—for distributor credits, and sensitivity analyses are performed to assess the impact of changes in these estimates. Management monitors global macroeconomic conditions, interest rate exposures and foreign currency risk using forward currency exchange contracts and interest rate derivatives and performs regular sensitivity analyses on marketable securities and debt obligations to evaluate the potential effects on cash flows and fair values. The treasury function manages worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds held by foreign subsidiaries and assessing the cost effectiveness of repatriation, supported by information management processes to monitor credit exposure, diversify investments and minimize risk. Research and development investments in innovative technologies and processes reflect a continued commitment to maintain product leadership and support business strategies. Continuous assessments of global macroeconomic conditions and strategic repositioning actions—such as workforce realignment and facility consolidations—are guided by analyses of operational effectiveness and efficiency, aligning expenses and resources with revenue trends and long-term strategic objectives.

Nike has emphasized the expansion of its digital infrastructure and enterprise technology to support its consumer-direct strategy and accelerate firm‐wide transformation, “unifying investments in data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering, inventory management and other areas against an end-to-end technology foundation” to drive greater speed, responsiveness and efficiency; throughout the pandemic, digital commerce remained operational and grew 79% on a currency-neutral basis, underpinned by increased digital fulfillment capacity in distribution centers; operating overhead expense rose due to continued investment in end-to-end digital capabilities, including support for a new enterprise resource planning tool, while demand creation expense shifted toward higher digital brand marketing costs; global brand divisions now encompass costs associated with “Nike direct global digital operations and enterprise technology” and reflect elevated wage-related and administrative expenses from investments in data and analytics capabilities, digital commerce platforms and the ERP implementation, all intended to accelerate Nike’s evolution into a digital-first company delivering seamless consumer experiences through digital platforms and Nike-owned stores.

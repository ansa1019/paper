In its management’s discussion and analysis, the company highlights a broad transformation of its technology infrastructure, including significant contractual commitments for information-technology outsourcing and enterprise-wide software licensing and maintenance, the adoption of core management systems, tools and processes across the enterprise to improve prioritization, agility and execution, and the development of a modern, digital, integrated platform and user experience accompanied by thoughtful user migration plans. The operations section specifically cites transforming technology infrastructure to support growth, improve cost efficiency and mitigate cyber risk, developing an enterprise-wide data strategy and execution plan that leverages machine learning and data science, and further enhancing compliance through robust risk and internal controls. The market intelligence segment’s IT capability is reinforced by its acquisition of Kensho Technologies Inc., a provider of next-generation analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning and data visualization systems, ongoing enhancements to its desktop platform with content, feature and performance improvements—such as Kensho-driven topic search—and the deployment of data management solutions offering customizable bulk data feeds and application programming interfaces. Platts has laid the groundwork for simplifying its customer-facing and operating platforms to improve user experience, and corporate unallocated expense increases reflect investments in company-wide technology projects. Depreciation and amortization rose primarily due to the amortization of intangibles from technology-focused acquisitions and capitalized technology projects, and 2016 included a $24 million technology-related impairment charge. Collectively, these initiatives demonstrate the firm’s ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources to enhance business strategies, work processes, information management capability and interfirm coordination.

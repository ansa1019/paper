Mastercard describes itself as “a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks,” and states that it “makes payments easier and more efficient by creating a wide range of payment solutions and services using our family of well-known brands, including Mastercard®, Maestro® and Cirrus®.” The company explains that “through our core global payments processing network, we facilitate the switching (authorization, clearing and settlement) of payment transactions and deliver related products and services,” and, with “additional payment capabilities that include real-time account based payments (including automated clearing house transactions), we offer customers one partner to turn to for their payment needs for both domestic and cross-border transactions across multiple payment flows.” Mastercard further notes that it “provides value-added offerings such as safety and security products, information and analytics services, consulting, loyalty and reward programs and issuer and acquirer processing,” and that “our payment solutions are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments system.” In discussing its cost structure, the MD&A highlights that “data processing and telecommunication expenses increased … due to capacity growth of our business,” and that “personnel expenses increased … to support our continued investment in the areas of real-time account-based payments, digital, services, data analytics and geographic expansion,” underscoring the firm’s ongoing investments in technology infrastructure, information management capability and operational capacity to support and enhance its business strategies.

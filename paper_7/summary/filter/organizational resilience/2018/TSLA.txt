Tesla’s product offerings include enhanced autopilot options, internet connectivity and free over-the-air software updates designed to provide additional safety, convenience and performance features. The company retains the ability to improve its vehicles through over-the-air software updates, frequently releasing minor software updates and periodically delivering key version updates to introduce capabilities such as “Navigate on Autopilot,” which enables vehicles to change lanes, transition between freeways and exit freeways under appropriate circumstances and driver input, with a long-term objective of full autonomy. To support customer convenience, Tesla is updating the Tesla mobile app for scheduling service appointments and is optimizing its parts distribution network and installation processes to bolster servicing capabilities. In the energy segment, Tesla provides customers with a proprietary monitoring system that captures and displays historical energy generation data as part of its solar energy systems, reflecting the company’s focus on information management capability to deliver accurate and timely data. Furthermore, the sales strategy for energy generation products has shifted toward direct channels—Tesla stores and the website—leveraging digital connectivity and cross-selling opportunities to an expanding base of vehicle owners.

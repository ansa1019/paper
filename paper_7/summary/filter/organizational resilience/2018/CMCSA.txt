Comcast identifies itself as a global media and technology company and describes ongoing investments in technology infrastructure, noting capital expenditures in its cable communications segment for scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity and for customer premises equipment primarily for its X1 platform, cloud DVR technology and wireless gateways. The high-speed internet service delivers downstream speeds up to 1 Gbps and fiber-based speeds up to 2 Gbps, and the deployment of wireless gateways creates an in-home Wi-Fi network that customers may “personalize and manage … remotely,” including password changes, device identification and parental controls. Its technical and product support expenses include costs for network operations, product development, fulfillment and provisioning, and the company has “expanded its enterprise service offerings to include a software-defined networking product … and support services related to Wi-Fi networks, router management, network security, business continuity risks and other services.” Consolidated depreciation and amortization increased “due to … expenditures for software,” and advertising revenue now encompasses the sale of advertising on its digital platforms supported by “technology, tools, data-driven services and marketplace solutions.” In its investing activities, Comcast notes cash paid for intangible assets “consisted primarily of expenditures for software,” underscoring the company’s focus on deploying and enhancing technology capabilities to support business strategies and operational efficiency.

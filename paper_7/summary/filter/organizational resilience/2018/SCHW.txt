In 2018, Schwab’s continued investments in its technology‐based resources were reflected in a 12% increase in total expenses excluding interest, which included significant technology project spending to support and fuel business growth; higher depreciation and amortization driven by the amortization of internally developed software associated with software and technology enhancements; and elevated capital expenditures due to U.S. campus expansions and targeted investments in technology projects, including $167 million of capitalized internal‐use software development costs. Recognizing that its operations are highly dependent on the integrity and resilience of critical business functions and technology systems, Schwab maintains a robust backup and recovery infrastructure with geographically dispersed facilities, routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans, and a formally established incident management program to minimize interruptions and downtime. To manage information security risk, the firm has designed and implemented an integrated security program that “knits together complementary tools, controls and technologies to protect systems, client accounts and data,” employs advanced monitoring systems to detect and deter unauthorized access, enforces internal authentication measures, restricts data access, and provides ongoing privacy and security training to employees, while dedicated fraud and cyber security teams continuously monitor for threats. Schwab also addresses third-party technology risk by applying contractual provisions, control standards, ongoing performance monitoring, and rigorous testing to outsourced technology, processing, servicing, and support functions, and integrates these efforts into its broader enterprise risk management and operational risk oversight frameworks.

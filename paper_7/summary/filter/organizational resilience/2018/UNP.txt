We will continue using a multi‚Äêfaceted approach to safety, utilizing technology, risk assessment, training and employee engagement, quality control, and targeted capital investments, and we will expand the deployment of our total safety culture and courage to care programs to identify and implement best practices for employee and operational safety. Continued implementation and testing of positive train control across a larger portion of our network also affected average train speed as we integrate this critical safety technology. We are working through a terminal rationalization process to more fully optimize our train operations and crew resources, aligning our management structure and decision-making processes with the Unified Plan 2020 operating model. Our 2019 capital plan includes approximately $3.2 billion of investments to renew and improve existing infrastructure and to fund new capacity projects designed to support future business growth and operational efficiency, with significant expenditures for locomotive modernization, freight cars, and technology and other system enhancements. In our operating expenses, we continue to incur costs for telephone and cellular services and computer software to support our growing operational and information management needs.

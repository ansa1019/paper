In 2018, the company’s expansion of its e-commerce business domestically and internationally, which materially contributed to net sales growth, reflects the deployment and integration of digital platforms and infrastructures to support member transactions and online offerings. Concurrently, the firm incurred costs related to the modernization of its information systems, including increased depreciation for newly placed-in-service projects, and established centralized return centers in the U.S., underscoring ongoing investments in IT architecture and process optimization. Membership-fee revenues are managed through a deferred-recognition system that provides for accurate, timely and secure allocation of fees over the one-year membership period, while the processing of unsettled credit and debit card receivables, which generally settle within four days, and the accounting for foreign-currency transaction gains and losses on forward foreign-exchange contracts, are handled by integrated financial and risk-management platforms. The maintenance of bank credit facilities, commercial paper programs and standby letters of credit, together with the tracking of purchase and lease obligations, implies the use of robust treasury and contract-management systems. Capital expenditures include significant allocations for information systems alongside warehouse, manufacturing and distribution facility development, demonstrating the firm’s ability to acquire, deploy and reconfigure IT resources to support new warehouse openings, relocations and expansions. Insurance and self-insurance liabilities are estimated using actuarial modeling that leverages data analytics and management, and the determination of income-tax provisions relies on complex judgments supported by tax compliance and planning software. Collectively, these initiatives illustrate the firm’s capability to mobilize, integrate and leverage IT-based resources and other organizational assets in support of its global operations and strategic objectives.

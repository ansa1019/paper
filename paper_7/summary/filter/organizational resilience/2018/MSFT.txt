Microsoftâ€™s platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency, and we generate revenue by licensing an array of software products, offering a wide range of cloud-based and other services to people and businesses, and designing, manufacturing, and selling devices, with our most significant expenses related to compensating employees, datacenter costs in support of our cloud-based services, and investments in infrastructure and devices. Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in technologies and business models, and at Microsoft we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment, and the investments we are making in cloud engineering, commercial sales capacity, and artificial intelligence and gaming engineering will continue to increase our operating costs and support our transformational shift to cloud-based offerings. Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content, and fiscal 2018 R&D increased primarily due to investments in cloud engineering and LinkedIn expenses. In our productivity and business processes segment, Office 365 commercial and Dynamics 365 revenue growth reflect a continued shift to cloud, and LinkedIn revenue is driven by talent solutions; in our intelligent cloud segment, server products and cloud services revenue growth of 21% was driven by Azure infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service consumption-based and per user-based services, with cloud services scale and efficiencies contributing to gross margin improvement; and in our more personal computing segment, Windows commercial and OEM revenue, Xbox software and services revenue, search advertising revenue driven by higher revenue per search and volume, and Surface revenue from a higher mix of premium devices all contributed to revenue growth, with operating expenses including investments in search, AI, gaming engineering, and commercial sales capacity. Unearned revenue related to our volume licensing programs includes software assurance and cloud services and is recognized ratably over the coverage period. Other planned uses of capital include additions to property and equipment for new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for R&D, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff, with capital expenditures expected to increase to support growth in our cloud offerings. The adoption of the new revenue recognition standard had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, including the accounting judgment required to determine the pattern of delivery and stand-alone selling price for arrangements that combine on-premises software licenses and cloud services, which are recognized over time.

Under its transformation initiatives, the company has redeployed cost savings into research and development and other priority areas while implementing an evolving operating model to deliver strategic, financial and operational flexibility, characterized by a more focused commercial infrastructure, a competitive and agile R&D organization to accelerate the pipeline, streamlined manufacturing networks and leaner administrative functions. Enterprise-wide allocations include information technology expenses alongside facilities, employee compensation and other support costs, reflecting the firm’s ongoing investment in the systems and processes that underpin its business strategy and work flows, and pension valuations employ actuarial assumptions and external data sources for projected cash flows. The company has established governance procedures and monitoring systems to track inventory levels across U.S. wholesalers and international direct customers, leveraging wholesaler out-movement reporting, internal forecasts and third-party market research to estimate months on hand and comply with SEC requirements under its consent order. Revenue recognition and gross-to-net adjustments for charge-backs, rebates, returns and discounts require significant estimates that draw upon historical experience, contractual pricing programs and both internal and external data, illustrating the firm’s reliance on integrated information management and data analytics to support its financial reporting, transaction-price allocation and overall decision-making processes.

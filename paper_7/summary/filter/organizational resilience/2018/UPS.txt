During 2018, the company continued to advance its IT-enabled strategic transformation, investing $709 million in information technology to support technology-enabled enhancements and capitalized software projects and bringing new facility and technology initiatives on-line as part of its broader transformation strategy. These investments have expanded the technology-enabled network and smart global logistics network through automation and capacity expansion projects designed to improve package sorting and delivery productivity. Depreciation and amortization reflected both the depreciation on assets placed in service from these technology and facility projects and the prospective revision of useful lives for internally developed capitalized software. Other operating expenses increased from higher data processing costs and security protection, reflecting the ongoing growth in IT resource deployment and operational support activities. Although these technology modernization efforts incurred near-term transformation costs and incremental depreciation, they underpin future operational flexibility and network efficiency enhancements.

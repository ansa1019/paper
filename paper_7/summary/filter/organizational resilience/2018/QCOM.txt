In fiscal 2018 we continued to invest significant resources toward advancements primarily in support of 4G- and 5G-based technologies as well as other technologies to extend demand for our products and generate new or expanded licensing opportunities, including within adjacent industry segments outside traditional cellular industries such as automotive, the Internet of Things and networking. We develop and commercialize foundational technologies and products used in mobile devices and other wireless products, including network equipment, broadband gateway equipment and consumer electronics devices, and derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing our intellectual property, including patents, software and other rights. Our QCT segment develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software based on CDMA, OFDMA and other technologies for use in mobile devices, wireless networks, IoT devices, broadband gateways, consumer electronics and automotive telematics and infotainment systems, while our QTL segment grants licenses to use portions of its intellectual property portfolio, which includes patent rights essential to the manufacture and sale of wireless products. In support of these strategies, we expended $5.6 billion in research and development in fiscal 2018, including pre-commercial development of 5G technologies and RFFE technologies from our RF360 Holdings joint venture, and we have announced a cost plan designed to align our cost structure to long-term margin targets, executing targeted actions across our businesses to reduce annual costs by $1 billion. Looking forward, we expect initial commercial 5G network deployments and device launches to begin in calendar 2019 and believe that 5G technologies will drive transformation across industries beyond traditional cellular communications to create new business models and services. We continue to invest in targeted opportunities that leverage our technical and business expertise to deploy new business models and expand into new industry segments such as automotive, IoT, networking, computing and artificial intelligence, and we devote resources to educating participants in the wireless value chain and governments regarding the benefits of our licensing program and our extensive technology investments in promoting a highly competitive and innovative wireless industry.

R&D expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs, and because of the lead times necessary to manufacture products, Micron typically begins to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing, deeming development of a product complete only once it is qualified through reviews and tests for performance and reliability. The company shares the cost of certain product and process development activities under development agreements with partners, including agreements to jointly develop NAND and 3D XPoint technologies with Intel, and continues to jointly develop NAND through the third generation of 3D NAND expected in the second half of 2019 before transitioning to independent development in the second quarter of 2018 to better optimize technology and products for respective business needs. To develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, Micron must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities and equipment, and R&D, estimating capital expenditures in 2019 for property, plant, and equipment, net of partner contributions, at $10.5 billion plus or minus 5 percent focused on technology transitions and product enablement, with commitments of approximately $1.8 billion as of August 30, 2018. The firm’s primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and financing obtained from capital markets and financial institutions, including an undrawn $2 billion revolving credit facility expiring in July 2023, and it expects that its cash and investments, cash flows from operations, and available financing will be sufficient to meet its requirements at least through the next 12 months. To mitigate credit risk, Micron invests through high-credit-quality financial institutions and by policy generally limits concentration of credit exposure by restricting the amount of investments with any single obligor; as of August 30, 2018, $3.08 billion of cash and marketable investments was held by foreign subsidiaries, of which $1.71 billion, including substantially all of the amounts held by MMJ, was considered indefinitely reinvested. In May 2018, the Board authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $10 billion of common stock beginning in 2019, and from August 31, 2018 through October 12, 2018, Micron repurchased $1.65 billion of its common stock under an accelerated share repurchase agreement, a Rule 10b5-1 plan, and open market repurchases. The coordination of these collaborative development partnerships, capital investment plans, financing strategies, and resource allocation underscores the firm’s capability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure resources in support of business strategies and work processes.

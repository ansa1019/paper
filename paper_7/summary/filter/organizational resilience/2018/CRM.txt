Our management discussion highlights our evolution as a global leader in CRM technology that empowers customers of every size and industry to connect in new ways through existing and emerging digital technologies, including cloud, mobile, social, Internet of Things and artificial intelligence, and underscores our IT capability as the coordinated deployment of our multi-tenant architecture, data center capacity, software development, integration solutions and professional cloud services in support of business strategies and work processes.  We describe our customer success platform—including sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, digital commerce, analytics, application development, IoT integration, collaborative productivity tools, our enterprise cloud marketplace and related professional services—as the core vehicle for mobilizing our technology resources, knowledge, management skills and business process understanding to deliver scalable, secure and reliable solutions.  To support future growth and operational flexibility, we plan to continue expanding our data center footprint internally and through third parties, investing in cyber security measures, enhancing system infrastructure and allocating overhead such as IT infrastructure, computer equipment and software based on headcount.  Our research and development expenses focus on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, improving functionality, ease of use and security, and maintaining a single version of our application to reduce complexity.  The acquisitions of MuleSoft and Datorama further extend our integration cloud and analytics capabilities, enabling customers to integrate data across platforms and marketing channels and fostering third-party application development through our AppExchange.  Cost of subscription and support revenues reflects expenses related to delivering our service and providing support—including depreciation and amortization of capitalized software and acquired developed technologies and fees paid for third-party technology services—while amortization of deferred commissions and capitalized contract costs underscores our strategic resource allocation to customer acquisition and retention.  These initiatives together illustrate our competence in reconfiguring and leveraging IT resources to drive innovation, connectivity, process optimization, agile go-to-market strategies and sustained competitive advantage in dynamic global markets.

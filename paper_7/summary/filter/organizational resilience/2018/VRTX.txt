The Company’s financial reporting and operational controls reflect an underlying information management capability through which it tracks “available information regarding changes … to the payor mix for our products, … contractual terms with third-party payors and … governmental programs and regulations and levels of our products in the distribution channel” to estimate rebates, chargebacks and discounts; relies on “forecasts of … units we will distribute” under annual reimbursement limits to defer and recognize revenue; employs “present-value models … based on multiple probability-weighted scenarios involving the development and potential commercialization of the underlying drug candidates” to value intangible assets and contingent milestone, royalty and option payments and makes “significant judgment … in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions”; identifies “all material performance obligations,” estimates variable consideration under either an expected-value or most-likely-amount method, allocates the transaction price on a relative standalone selling price basis and “constrains” estimates of variable consideration to avoid revenue reversals; maintains a corporate compliance program “designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems and through the promotion of a culture of compliance”; closely “monitors the results of our discovery, research, clinical trials and nonclinical studies and frequently evaluates our drug development programs in light of new data and scientific, business and commercial insights”; and, with the adoption of new lease accounting guidance, has configured its enterprise resource planning and capital-asset systems to determine whether primary facility leases qualify as financing or operating leases, to estimate “fair value of the buildings … at lease inception” and to select appropriate “discount rates,” thereby redeploying its technology, data and processes to support complex accounting judgments, strategic resource allocation and regulatory compliance.

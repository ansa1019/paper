Management’s use of adjusted earnings as a non-GAAP financial measure “internally for financial planning, analysis of performance, reporting of results to the board of directors and as an input in determining performance-based compensation under Nee’s employee incentive compensation plans,” and in communications to analysts and investors, implies an information management capability that provides data with the accuracy, timeliness and reliability required to support strategic decision-making. Likewise, Nee’s enterprise risk management framework—employing derivative instruments for hedging, value-at-risk models and market risk sensitivities—and its use of industry-standard valuation techniques to develop forward price curves from commodity prices, system heat rates and supply-demand forecasts, demonstrate the coordination of IT-based analytical tools with business process understanding to assess and manage market exposures. The application of fair-value accounting to energy contracts, interest-rate and foreign-currency derivatives, using both observable and unobservable inputs, further underscores the firm’s ability to acquire, deploy and reconfigure technology resources and modeling capabilities in support of complex valuation and reporting requirements. In addition, the monitoring of credit exposures through master netting agreements, credit limits and collateral arrangements reflects integrated information systems and governance processes for real-time counterparty risk management. Finally, the management of restricted funds for nuclear decommissioning and storm restoration, invested in marketable debt and equity securities and governed to balance liquidity with investment returns, illustrates systematic data management and investment oversight processes that align technology, financial activities and organizational goals across Nee’s operations.

Bank of America’s consumer banking operations are underpinned by extensive digital infrastructure, including leading digital banking platforms (www.bankofamerica.com) serving over 36 million active users—26 million of whom access services via mobile devices—demonstrating the firm’s emphasis on connectivity, user access and market responsiveness. The MD&A discloses noninterest expense of $3.2 billion for data processing and $699 million for telecommunications in 2018, reflecting substantial investment in technology infrastructure and operational systems, while the $316 million impairment charge in 2017 related to certain data centers underscores ongoing optimization of IT capacity and resource deployment. References to “investments in digital capabilities and business growth,” combined with continued branch network enhancements, illustrate the integration of technology-enabled resources in support of business transformation, operational flexibility and enhanced customer relationships. Moreover, purchase obligations for communication services, processing services and software contracts point to the firm’s commitment to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources and capabilities in alignment with evolving business strategies and organizational goals.

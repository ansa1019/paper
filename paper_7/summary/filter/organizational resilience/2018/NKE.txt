Nike designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services through Nike-owned retail stores and digital platforms (collectively “Nike Direct”), and our strategy is to deliver compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail. In June 2017, we announced the Consumer Direct Offense, a new company alignment designed to allow Nike to better serve the consumer personally, at scale by leveraging the power of digital to accelerate innovation and product creation, move even closer to the consumer through key cities and deepen one-to-one connections. Reflecting this strategy, selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues increased due to investments in digital capabilities, consumer experiences and product and brand marketing to drive long-term growth. As a result, Nike Direct revenues represented approximately 30% of total Nike brand revenues for fiscal 2018 (versus 28% in fiscal 2017) and increased 12% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong digital commerce sales growth of 25%, the addition of new stores and comparable store sales growth. Reported digital commerce sales were $2.8 billion for fiscal 2018 (27% of total Nike Direct revenues, versus 24% in fiscal 2017). Regionally, Nike Direct revenues grew across North America, EMEA, Greater China and APLA, each benefiting from robust digital commerce performance. We continue to invest in our infrastructure to support future growth, including corporate facilities, expanding our digital capabilities and new Nike Direct stores.

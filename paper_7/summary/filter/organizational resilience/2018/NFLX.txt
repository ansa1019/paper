The company is scaling its streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features, refining its systems and operational practices and developing technology while utilizing third-party “cloud” computing services. It employs its own communications and computer hardware systems in its facilities and at third-party web hosting providers, third-party cloud computing services and proprietary and third-party content delivery networks—including its Open Connect global content-delivery network—and has architected its software and computer systems to utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other services provided by Amazon Web Services, on which it runs the vast majority of its computing. The company utilizes a combination of proprietary and third-party technology to recommend and merchandise content to consumers and to enable fast and efficient delivery of content to various consumer electronic devices, and it continues to invest in technology and development personnel, hardware and software to support improvements in user interface, recommendation, merchandising and streaming delivery infrastructure as part of its international expansion. It relies on encryption and authentication technology to secure member and corporate data and has implemented systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect its data and systems, yet acknowledges that its computer systems and those of third parties remain subject to cyber-attacks, system interruptions and evolving security threats that could result in service loss or degradation, unauthorized data disclosure or intellectual property theft. The company further recognizes that its ability to provide streaming content depends on technological and business relationships with device partners, network operators and studios, and that changes in network-operator practices—such as usage-based pricing, bandwidth caps, discriminatory network management, net neutrality regulations or data localization requirements—or partners’ failure to update their devices could impede its operational flexibility, market responsiveness and competitive position.

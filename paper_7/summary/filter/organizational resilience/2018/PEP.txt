PepsiCo’s management discussion highlights the role of technology in driving its capabilities and resilience across assets, processes and relationships. In its executive overview the company states that it will “transform our core capabilities with technology and build and retain a talented workforce to drive cost savings” as part of productivity initiatives aimed at improving operational efficiency and enhancing competitive advantage. Under “business risks” PepsiCo points to the “rapid growth in e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters,” and affirms that “we continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce capabilities, distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.” In order to oversee and manage digital, operational and cyber risks, the board “receives updates on key risks throughout the year, including risks related to cybersecurity,” and the company “leverages an integrated risk management framework” supported by a Risk Management Office that “provides ongoing guidance, tools and analytical support” and facilitates communication with the board and its committees. Moreover, PepsiCo’s Corporate Audit Department continually “evaluates the ongoing effectiveness of our key internal controls through periodic audit and review procedures,” while its Compliance & Ethics and Law Departments “lead and coordinate our compliance policies and practices,” reflecting governance structures, data management and technical tools aligned to support business strategies, risk mitigation and organizational transformation.

AbbVie leverages its information management capability by employing both GAAP and non-GAAP measures—such as constant-currency net revenue analyses—to provide users with timely, accurate and transparent insights into operational performance over multiple periods. The company collects and integrates internal and external data to estimate inventory levels, rebate processing lags and credit risk, regularly monitoring rebate trends, contract terms, legislative changes and customer creditworthiness across domestic and international markets to adjust accruals and allowances. Actuarial analyses for pension and post-employment benefits apply yield-curve methodologies and assumptions regarding discount rates, expected asset returns and health care cost trends to calculate obligations and periodic benefit costs. AbbVie also revalues contingent consideration liabilities at fair value using inputs such as projected sales, milestone probabilities, discount rates and market factors, and incorporates foreign exchange and interest rate fluctuations into its financial reporting. These practices demonstrate the firm’s competence in acquiring, deploying and reconfiguring information resources in support of strategic decision-making, operational flexibility and sustainable competitive advantage.

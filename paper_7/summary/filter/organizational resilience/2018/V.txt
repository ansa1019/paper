Visa describes itself as a global payments technology company whose advanced transaction processing network, VisaNet, “enables authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions” and “allows us to provide our financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services,” reflecting its core IT capability of coordinating assets, processes and interfirm information flows. Data processing revenues are “earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally,” while network and processing expenses “mainly represent expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services.” Depreciation and amortization expense includes both property and equipment and “amortization of purchased and internally developed software,” underscoring ongoing investment in technology infrastructure and system enhancements. Service revenues—“assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter’s payments volume”—and international transaction revenues—“earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities”—demonstrate the use of IT systems to support business strategies and respond to market dynamics. Client incentives, when they meet recoverability criteria, are capitalized and “amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit,” reflecting the tailoring of resource deployment to evolving performance expectations. Settlement guarantee management relies on IT architecture to monitor exposures, enforce collateral requirements and ensure timely payments settlement, while treasury policies and the management of liquidity through investment in securities support continued funding of IT-driven innovations and operational scalability.

In designing our products, we focus on making our technology easy and safe to use, taking a holistic “systems” approach to offer intelligent technology and systems designed to work together; all da Vinci systems include a surgeon’s console, imaging electronics, a patient-side cart and computational hardware and software that enable surgeons to operate via a 3D high-definition image and overcome many of the limitations of traditional open surgery through computational, robotic and imaging technologies. Within our integrated ecosystem, our products are designed to decrease variability in surgery by offering dependable, consistent functionality and user experiences for surgeons seeking better outcomes, mobilizing computer-aided tools such as fully wristed multi-jointed instruments with tremor-filtering and integrated endoscopes, using voice- and laser-guided set-up technology, and providing a range of articulation analogous to the motions of a human wrist. Training technologies—including our da Vinci Skills simulator, da Vinci Connect remote case observation and mentoring tool, and dual console for surgeon proctoring and collaborative surgery—enhance personnel capability and process optimization. We continue to invest in research and development across a broader set of product development initiatives—including robotic-assisted catheter-based medical devices, advanced imaging and analytics, advanced instrumentation and future generations of robotics—leveraging proprietary intellectual property to support strategic technology deployment. Commercial introductions of new platforms such as the da Vinci SP single-port system, the da Vinci X model with pathway upgrade options, and the Ion endoluminal system reflect our commitment to extending connectivity, operational flexibility and market-responsive innovation across clinical applications.

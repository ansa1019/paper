The company’s management discussion highlights its evolution of technology capabilities through the successful execution of a comprehensive product roadmap, with new high-performance products accounting for over 65 percent of 2018 revenue, including second-generation Ryzen and Ryzen Threadripper WX processors, integrated Zen CPU and Vega GPU APUs for desktop and commercial PCs, enterprise-class Ryzen Pro notebook APUs and EPYC Embedded 3000 and Ryzen Embedded V1000 families that deliver enhanced computing and graphics performance for thin clients, digital signage and infrastructure markets. Research and development expenses increased 20 percent to $1.4 billion in 2018, driven primarily by a $168 million rise in product engineering and design costs across both segments and higher employee incentives tied to financial performance, while marketing, general and administrative expenses grew 9 percent to $562 million, reflecting increased sales and marketing activities to support broader product adoption and strategic business alignment. The discussion further emphasizes the firm’s operational flexibility and resource mobilization through working-capital management—net cash provided by operating activities rose to $34 million driven by higher cash collections from increased revenue—and targeted capital investments, with $163 million spent on property and equipment and maintenance of a $500 million secured revolving line of credit, underscoring the company’s ongoing commitment to deploy and reconfigure technology resources in support of business strategies, market responsiveness and sustained competitive advantage.

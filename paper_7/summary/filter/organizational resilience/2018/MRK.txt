Merck’s healthcare services segment provides services and solutions that focus on engagement, health analytics and clinical services to improve the value of care delivered to patients, reflecting an increasing reliance on digital technologies to coordinate assets, processes and external relationships. In December 2018, Merck announced an agreement to acquire Antelliq Group, a leader in digital animal identification, traceability and monitoring solutions, underscoring its strategic deployment of IT‐enabled capabilities to enhance supply chain management and interfirm transactions. The June 27, 2017 network cyber-attack that disrupted worldwide manufacturing, research and sales operations highlighted the importance of robust IT governance, information security and operational resilience, prompting remediation efforts and the recognition of related expenses—and the receipt of disputed insurance proceeds—to restore system integrity and business continuity. The company’s expanded capital expenditures program, focused primarily on increasing future manufacturing capacity, and its ongoing allocation of resources to support both near-term commercial opportunities and long-term growth priorities, suggest an underlying emphasis on mobilizing technology resources and IT architecture to sustain innovation, operational flexibility and competitive advantage across its business segments.

KKR’s discussion of risk factors acknowledges that “technological advancements and innovations … may disrupt marketplaces and businesses,” implicitly highlighting the firm’s need to mobilize technology resources and adapt its coordination of assets, processes and interfirm relationships to evolving digital and market dynamics. Within general, administrative and other expenses, KKR cites costs for “communications and information services,” underscoring its reliance on information management capability to support legal, accounting, advisory and consulting functions across its global investment platform. The firm’s valuation practices for private equity, real assets and credit portfolios rely on sophisticated modelling—discounted cash flows, market comparables and scenario analyses—drawing on timely, accurate data and assumptions about market comparables, cost of capital and commodity‐price forecasts, reflecting the importance of information systems capability, data analytics and process optimization in assessing investment values and making strategic resource allocation decisions. Although described primarily in accounting terms, the consolidation of certain funds “significantly impacts the financial statement presentation under GAAP,” demonstrating the complexity of integrating multiple information flows and financial reporting systems across consolidated entities and third‐party interests, an implicit reference to the need for robust IT architectures and organizational integration to manage operational complexity and support firm‐wide performance and compliance.

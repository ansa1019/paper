Systems development and programming costs increased in fiscal 2022 due to higher investments and costs to develop, support, and maintain our new and existing products. During the year, we made significant progress on the roll-out of a new unified user experience across our strategic products and solutions, transitioning hundreds of thousands of clients across our RUN, iHCM and Next-Gen HCM client bases to more intuitive HCM workflows. We continued to advance all of our key platforms—particularly Workforce Now, which proved critical to our differentiation and growth—and expanded deployment of our Next-Gen Payroll solution to a growing portion of new Workforce Now clients. In the fourth quarter, we introduced self-enrollment with full digital wallet capabilities within the Wisely program to deliver a frictionless digital payment experience and expanded our Earned Wage Access solution into a seamless, one-application offering. We will also launch “Voice of the Employee,” a survey and listening tool designed to capture feedback across various HR categories. We lead the HCM industry by driving growth through strategic, cloud-based HCM solutions and innovations such as our Next-Gen platforms, supplemented by targeted, organic investments in ADP DataCloud and ADP Marketplace and underpinned by our compliance expertise. We remain committed to continuous innovation amid challenging operating environments and to strengthening our IT capability through ongoing enhancements in research and development and broad-based transformation initiatives.

Oracle provides products and services that address enterprise information technology (IT) environments through a broad spectrum of applications and infrastructure offerings delivered worldwide via flexible and interoperable IT deployment models—including on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid deployments—to facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit customers’ needs. Our Cloud and License business markets, sells and delivers enterprise applications and infrastructure technologies through license support contracts, cloud services subscriptions and license transactions, recognizing revenues ratably over contractual terms for services and support and at the point in time when software is made available for download in the case of licenses. To meet growing customer demand and enable choice, we introduced programs to pivot applications and infrastructure licenses and related support to the Oracle Cloud and continue to make investments in research and development and our cloud operations to develop, improve, increase capacity and expand the geographic footprint of our cloud and license products and services while managing Oracle Cloud capacity requirements. Our Hardware business offers a highly interdependent and interrelated combined performance obligation of enterprise hardware products and related software, with revenues recognized upon delivery and ownership transfer, and we expect to make further investments in R&D to improve existing hardware offerings and develop new hardware products and services. Our Services business leverages Oracle technologies, extensive experience, intellectual property and best practices to help customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies, with services recognized over time as they are performed. A selective and active acquisition program further enhances our IT capabilities by integrating complementary companies, products, services and technologies in alignment with our corporate strategy, for which we estimate the financial impacts on earnings, operating margin, cash flows and return on invested capital before proceeding. Research and development expenditures, personnel-related investments and infrastructure enhancements underscore our commitment to maintaining competitive IT capability, and operating segment reporting to our chief operating decision makers ensures that resource allocation and strategic decisions are closely aligned with business needs, market dynamics and customer requirements.

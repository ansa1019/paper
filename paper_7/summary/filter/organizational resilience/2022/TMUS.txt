In connection with the Sprint merger, we recorded merger-related costs that include integration costs to achieve efficiencies in network, retail, information technology and back-office operations, migrate customers to the T-Mobile network and billing systems, and accelerate or terminate certain operating and financing leases for cell sites, switch sites and network equipment, as well as identify and decommission duplicative networks—including the legacy Sprint CDMA and LTE networks—to realize synergies by eliminating redundancies in network costs and business processes and to support the accelerated build-out of our nationwide 5G network; we continue to invest in our digital infrastructure through spectrum license acquisitions, capital expenditures on network equipment and associated capitalized interest. Following a criminal cyberattack in August 2021 and an unauthorized API access incident beginning November 2022, we have committed an aggregate incremental spend of $150 million in 2022 and 2023 for data security and related technology and intend to allocate substantial additional resources toward cybersecurity initiatives over the next several years, working with leading external experts to enhance our information security capabilities, remediate vulnerabilities, resolve litigation and regulatory inquiries, and strengthen customer protection and data confidentiality.

Microsoft’s MD&A describes how the company’s platforms and tools drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness and public-sector efficiency through a broad range of cloud-based services, software licensing and support, and device offerings—all underpinned by substantial investments in datacenter infrastructure and ongoing research and development in cloud engineering, gaming and AI. The company’s ability to acquire, deploy and reconfigure IT resources is reflected in Microsoft Cloud revenue growth of 32% and the strategic acquisition of Nuance Communications to extend industry-specific AI and cloud capabilities. Management employs a suite of metrics—such as server products and cloud services revenue growth, commercial seat counts and remaining performance obligations—to inform the allocation of capital and operational resources and to evaluate the health of its cloud and on-premises product strategies. The continued shift to subscription and consumption-based licensing, with unearned revenue recognized ratably over coverage periods, underscores Microsoft’s focus on providing timely, reliable, secure and connected access to its software and services, thereby mobilizing technology infrastructure, knowledge, management skills and business process understanding in support of its mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet.

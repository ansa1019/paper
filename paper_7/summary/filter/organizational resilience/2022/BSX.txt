In 2022, we invested $588 million in property, plant and equipment and internal-use software to support our operations and enable enhanced information management and process automation. Our contractual liabilities include deferred revenue related to the Latitude™ patient management system within our cardiac rhythm management business, for which revenue is recognized over the average service period based on device and patient longevity, as well as deferred revenue related to the LUX-DX™ insertable cardiac monitor system, for which revenue is recognized over the average service period based on device longevity and usage. We have established controls and procedures to escalate enterprise-level issues, including cybersecurity matters, to the appropriate management levels and our board of directors, whereby cybersecurity issues—such as vulnerabilities introduced by third-party software—are analyzed by subject-matter experts and a crisis committee for potential financial, operational and reputational risks; issues deemed potentially material to our financial results, operations or reputation are immediately reported in accordance with our escalation framework, and members of management responsible for disclosure controls are informed in a timely manner of known cybersecurity risks and incidents that may materially impact our operations to ensure prompt public disclosure as appropriate. International conflicts, including the Russia/Ukraine war and tensions between China/Taiwan, have heightened cybersecurity risks; in response, we have taken steps to assess our readiness and the resilience of our critical business functions to mitigate potential impacts.

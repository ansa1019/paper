Across the Management’s Discussion and Analysis, Blackstone does not expressly frame the evolution of information technology capabilities, yet it repeatedly cites “technology-related expenses” as a material driver of other operating costs across its Real Estate, Private Equity and Credit & Insurance segments—an implicit acknowledgment of ongoing investments in technology resources, infrastructure and professional services to support business processes. In addition, Blackstone’s extensive use of financial and operating metrics to monitor productivity and performance suggests reliance on internal information‐management processes and systems to provide timely, accurate data for strategic decision‐making, even though no dedicated discussion of IT governance, digital transformation or IT architecture is presented.

Salesforce, Inc. describes itself as a global leader in customer relationship management technology that brings companies and customers together in the digital age and enables business transformation around the customer in a digital-first world through its Customer 360 platform, which “unites sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT teams by connecting customer data across systems, apps and devices to create a complete view of customers” and delivers a “single source of customer truth” that enhances responsiveness, productivity, efficiency and personalized experiences; with Slack, the company provides a “digital headquarters” enabling collaboration and success from anywhere. The cost of subscription and support revenues comprises expenses related to delivering cloud services and providing support, including “data center capacity, certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data, employee-related costs such as salaries and benefits, and allocated overhead,” as well as amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, while cost of professional services and other revenues consists of “employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based compensation expense, the cost of subcontractors, certain third-party fees and allocated overhead” that facilitate adoption of service offerings and support larger subscription contracts. Salesforce continues to invest in its enterprise cloud computing services, data center capacity and security measures “to scale with our customers and continuously evolve our security measures,” plans to add employees in its professional services group to facilitate adoption of its services, and increased research and development headcount “to improve and extend our service offerings, develop new technologies and integrate acquired companies,” with research and development expenses including salaries, stock-based compensation and allocated overhead. General and administrative expenses allocate overhead such as “information technology infrastructure, rent and occupancy charges” based on headcount, reflecting the role of IT infrastructure in supporting corporate functions. Contractual commitments include approximately $4.7 billion of non-cancelable minimum payments under leases for office space, co-location data center facilities, development and test data centers, computer equipment and software, plus $0.4 billion of uncommenced operating leases, and $6.5 billion in enforceable agreements with infrastructure service providers; these commitments are expected to be satisfied with cash on hand and operating cash flow. Subscription and support revenues by service offering include Slack in “platform and other” and analytics and integration in “data,” evidencing a strategic focus on digital technologies, data management capabilities, technology infrastructure and professional services to support evolving business needs, operational flexibility and competitive positioning.

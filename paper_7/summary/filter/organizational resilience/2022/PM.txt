Since 2008, PMI has invested over $10.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products, including the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities in pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research and post-market studies, reflecting its ongoing mobilization and deployment of specialized resources to support long-term business strategies and product innovation; in 2021 and early 2022, it acquired Fertin Pharma and Vectura Group to form the Vectura Fertin Pharma subsidiary and, in November 2022, acquired Swedish Match, thereby combining complementary technology, knowledge, management skills and interfirm relationships under expanded wellness and healthcare and smoke-free segments to enhance product development, market responsiveness and value creation; to reinforce consumer centricity and accelerate the speed of innovation and deployment, in January 2023 PMI reorganized its operations into four geographical regions—reconfiguring assets, internal processes and strategic resource allocation—while the relocation of its corporate headquarters to Stamford, Connecticut in November 2022 underscores further investment in organizational infrastructure to improve global coordination, connectivity and adaptability to evolving business needs.

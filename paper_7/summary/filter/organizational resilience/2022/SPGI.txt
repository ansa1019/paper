In our MD&A, we describe the evolution and deployment of information management and technology‐enabled capabilities through initiatives such as a company‐wide data council that promotes efficient integration, accessibility and governance of enterprise data assets—particularly sustainability data and data science—and the ongoing migration of all products and services to a cloud‐based ecosystem under a three‐year technology transition plan designed to shift investments toward high-growth innovation. The market intelligence segment, characterized as providing multi-asset-class data and analytics “integrated with purpose-built workflow solutions,” includes enterprise software offerings such as Wall Street Office, Enterprise Data Manager and Information Mosaic that manage and analyze data, automate processes, identify risk and support regulatory compliance. Subscription and recurring variable revenue streams from data feeds, valuation services, analytics and hosted product offerings illustrate our competence in acquiring, deploying and reconfiguring digital technology resources in support of business strategies, while an intersegment royalty for content and data licenses highlights the leveraging of such assets. Notably, operating profit growth in several segments was partially offset by increases in technology expenses and technology-related impairments, and capital expenditures explicitly encompass additions to technology projects. These disclosures underscore our strategic focus on technology infrastructure, information management capability and digital transformation as critical to our ability to support business needs, enhance operational flexibility and drive competitive advantage.

In 2022, we recorded significantly higher operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure—including $1.34 billion of abandonment charges on data center assets—and our capital expenditures of $32.04 billion reflected continued investments in data center capacity, servers, network infrastructure and buildings to support and enhance our business strategies and work processes. We increased headcount by 20% year-over-year in engineering and other technical functions, and research and development expenses rose 43% as we expanded our teams responsible for developing new products, improving existing products and advancing reality labs technology. We rely on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user activity on third-party websites and services to deliver relevant and effective ads, and in response to regulatory and platform changes we are developing privacy-enhancing technologies, tools to enable marketers to share their data into our systems and ad products that generate more valuable signals within our apps. Across all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve our delivery, targeting and measurement capabilities, and we continue to evolve our advertising systems and next-generation data center design to align our technology resources, processes and relationships with broader business needs and strategic priorities.

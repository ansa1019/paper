Management’s discussion of adjusted earnings, which are used internally for financial planning, performance analysis, board reporting and incentive compensation, reflects an underlying information management capability to provide financial data with the accuracy, timeliness and reliability needed to support strategic decisions. The description of valuation of derivative instruments at fair value using a combination of market-based and income-approach models, including internally developed forward price curves based on supply-demand fundamentals and heat-rate projections, implies the deployment of advanced data analytics and modeling systems to manage commodity price and interest-rate risk. Similarly, the use of value-at-risk models for trading and hedging portfolios, credit-risk monitoring through counterparty limits, collateral management and master netting agreements, and periodic exposure reporting indicate coordinated IT-enabled processes for risk management and resource allocation. The accounting for pension benefits and asset retirement obligations using actuarial and market-related valuation techniques further demonstrates integration of information systems to support long-term forecasting, regulatory compliance and performance metrics. Although not labeled as IT capability, these disclosures collectively show the firm’s competence in acquiring, deploying and reconfiguring technology and information resources to enhance business strategies, operational flexibility and market responsiveness.

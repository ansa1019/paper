NVIDIA’s operations reflect a continuous evolution and deployment of information technology capabilities through the design, development and deployment of advanced computing and networking platforms that integrate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems and services to support and enhance our business strategies and work processes. We build technology and products for novel use cases – for example the Omniverse platform and third-party large language and generative models – and offer enterprise customers NVIDIA AI Cloud services both directly and through partners, including NVIDIA DGX Cloud, a cloud-based infrastructure and software environment for training AI models, hosted by leading cloud service providers under multi-year agreements supporting these offerings and our research and development activities. In addition to cloud services, we provide standalone software solutions such as NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA Drive for automotive applications, thereby mobilizing and reconfiguring our IT resources, knowledge, management skills and human resources to create competitive advantage. Within our compute & networking segment, we announced and ramped the NVIDIA Hopper GPU architecture and the H100 Tensor Core GPU, launched the OVX server reference design for digital twins and Omniverse applications, introduced the Spectrum-4 400 Gbps networking platform and began shipping Quantum-2, reflecting strategic investments in IT infrastructure to drive market agility and operational flexibility. In professional visualization we added Ampere-architecture RTX GPUs for workstations, announced the Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine and Omniverse Cloud and released major updates to Omniverse Enterprise, further demonstrating our competence in deploying interfirm IT capabilities to support customer needs and transforming NVIDIA into a competitive force across data center, gaming, visualization and automotive markets. Additionally, our operating expenses, which include data center infrastructure and engineering development costs, underscore our ongoing commitment to strengthen our IT architecture, digital infrastructure and resource configuration in alignment with evolving business directions.

Our management’s discussion discloses that we incur substantial fixed and variable costs to build, run and enhance our technology infrastructure—including servers, networking equipment, data center facilities, online stores, web services, electronic devices and digital offerings—and to support AWS operations; that technology and content costs encompass payroll and related expenses for computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers and other employees engaged in research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, maintenance and curation of our online stores and cross-functional systems across geographical expansions; and that these investments are intended to enhance the customer experience, improve process efficiencies, deploy innovative software and electronic devices (including a global broadband satellite network and autonomous ride-hailing vehicles), and deliver a broad set of on-demand technology services—compute, storage, database, analytics and machine learning—to developers and enterprises of all sizes. We further state that we expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we add employees and technology infrastructure, that these investments are allocated to segments based on usage, and that advances in processing power, data storage and analytics, wireless connectivity, artificial intelligence and machine learning will continue to drive improvements in users’ Internet experience and support our ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources in alignment with our business strategies and work processes.

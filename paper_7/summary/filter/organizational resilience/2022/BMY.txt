In connection with the Celgene acquisition, the company achieved at least $3.0 billion of annual synergies across general and administrative, manufacturing, research and development and procurement, and also resulted in streamlining the company’s pricing and information technology infrastructure. Information technology is explicitly identified among the global enabling functions—together with finance, legal and human resources—through which enterprise-wide costs, including facilities and employee stock compensation, are allocated to research and development activities. To comply with its SEC consent order and to monitor inventory levels in the distribution channel, the company maintains data sharing agreements with its U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers that provide weekly information on product-level inventory and out-movement, and it supplements this with internal data and third-party market research to estimate months-on-hand inventory, forecast demand, determine government-mandated rebates and recognize revenue. The company also established a business risk and disclosure group and retained an outside consultant to comprehensively study and help reengineer its accounting and financial reporting processes, reflecting investments in organizational capabilities, process redesign and information management to support business strategies, improve operational flexibility and enhance governance of its systems.

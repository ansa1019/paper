In its Managementâ€™s Discussion and Analysis, Mastercard describes itself as a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide by enabling electronic payments instead of cash and checks and making those payment transactions safe, simple, smart and accessible. The company operates a multi-rail payments network that provides choice and flexibility and, through its unique and proprietary core global payments network, switches (authorizes, clears and settles) payment transactions, complemented by additional payment capabilities including automated clearing house transactions (both batch and real-time account-based payments). Using these capabilities, it offers integrated payment products and services and captures new payment flows, while its value-added services include cyber and intelligence solutions to allow all parties to transact easily and with confidence and other services that provide proprietary insights drawing on its principled use of secure consumer and merchant data. Mastercard states that its payment solutions are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments ecosystem, and that its investments in new networks, such as open banking solutions and digital identity capabilities, support and strengthen its payments and services solutions. Its franchise model sets the standards and ground-rules for its core global payments network in order to balance value and risk across all stakeholders and allow for interoperability among them. In 2022, the company updated its disaggregated net revenue presentation by category and geography to reflect the nature of its payment services and to align such information with the way in which management will prospectively view its categories of net revenue, reclassifying prior period amounts to conform to the 2022 presentation.

Nike’s discussion of its consumer direct acceleration strategy highlights an expanding digital infrastructure and technology foundation—“Nike-owned retail stores and sales through our digital platforms (also referred to as ‘Nike Brand Digital’)”—to deliver premium, seamless consumer experiences, underpinned by continued investments in data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering, inventory management and other areas “to create an end-to-end technology foundation, which we expect will further accelerate our digital transformation.” The company notes that operating overhead expense increased primarily due to “higher strategic technology investments” and “continued investment in digital capabilities,” while demand creation expense reflects higher “digital marketing to support heightened digital demand” and “investments in digital marketing.” Nike further emphasizes multi-year investment plans “to transform our business of the future,” including brand campaigns enabled by digital infrastructure, and describes global brand divisions costs as encompassing “Nike direct global digital operations and enterprise technology.” These disclosures implicitly attest to evolving IT capabilities that mobilize technology resources—ranging from digital platforms, data analytics and connectivity to enterprise systems—to support and enhance business strategies, improve operational responsiveness and drive competitive differentiation.

During the integration of TD Ameritrade, we significantly expanded our technology work and commenced a greater technology build-out to support the increased volumes of our combined client base. Professional services expense reflected increased utilization of technology-related services and enhancements to our technological infrastructure, while occupancy and equipment expense grew due to higher software maintenance agreements and technology equipment costs to support business growth. Depreciation and amortization rose as a result of accelerated amortization of purchased and internally developed software and increased depreciation of hardware, driven by capital expenditures focused on software development, information technology and telecommunications equipment, and facility expansions to enhance capacity for our expanding client base. Capital expenditures primarily consisted of capitalized software costs and IT and telecommunications investments, and we expect elevated levels of such investments through 2023 to support ongoing integration efforts and client-facing platform enhancements, including improved online self-service capabilities and streamlined call-routing processes. Our operational risk framework emphasizes the resilience of critical business functions and technology systems, underpinned by a backup and recovery infrastructure, geographically dispersed workforce, and routine testing of business continuity and disaster-recovery plans. We have designed and implemented an information security program that knits together complementary tools, controls, and authentication measures to protect systems, client accounts, and data, supported by comprehensive privacy and security training for employees and continuous monitoring to detect and respond to threats. We manage fraud and third-party risks through rigorous policies, procedures, contractual controls, ongoing performance monitoring of technology vendors, and appropriate testing with third-party service providers. Model risk governance ensures that models used for capital, credit, and pricing analyses are registered, classified by risk, validated, and subject to formal policy oversight. Under our enterprise risk management framework, cross-functional committees provide institutional governance over technology, operational, compliance, and financial risks, reinforcing accountability, strategic resource allocation, and organizational capability to support our business transformation and competitive positioning.

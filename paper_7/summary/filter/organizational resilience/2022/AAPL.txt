During fiscal 2022, the company recognized the evolving scope of its IT capability through leasing arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space, and through significant purchase obligations for capital assets as well as noncancelable obligations related to internet services and content creation. Services net sales include offerings from the company’s cloud, digital content, payment and other services, reflecting the provision of data and connectivity with appropriate levels of security, reliability and access in support of business processes. The year-over-year growth in research and development expense was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses and engineering program costs, indicating continued investment in technology functionalities, software development processes and technology deployment. The company utilizes several outsourcing partners, component suppliers and logistical service providers—acquiring components and building product based on demand information supplied by the company covering periods up to 150 days—and has experienced disruptions resulting in supply shortages, underscoring the importance of interfirm coordination and agile resource deployment. Its belief that its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements demonstrates reliance on integrated financial and information systems for strategic resource allocation, while management’s application of judgments, assumptions and estimates in accounting policies, uncertainty evaluations and legal contingencies illustrates governance over information accuracy, timeliness and reliability in support of strategic decision-making.

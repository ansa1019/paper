We invest in external research and technologies that we believe complement and strengthen our efforts through acquisitions, collaborations, investments, and licensing arrangements and view business-development activity as a way to enhance our pipeline and strengthen our business, and we manage research and development spending across our portfolio of potential new medicines and indications such that a delay or termination of any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending. We believe our available cash and cash equivalents, together with our ability to generate operating cash flow and our access to short-term and long-term borrowings, are sufficient to fund our existing and planned capital requirements, including working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends, debt repayments, milestone and royalty payments, and potential business development activities, and we continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources to ensure adequate and efficient financing of our capital requirements. To meet significant demand, we have entered, and expect to continue to enter, into various agreements for contract manufacturing and supply of materials, and we have expanded manufacturing capacity at our Research Triangle Park site in North Carolina and other global facilities. To limit the impact of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates on earnings, we employ a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments for interest rate swaps and foreign currency hedges, and our corporate risk-management policy outlines minimum and maximum hedge coverage; gains and losses on these instruments offset, in part, the impact of market fluctuations, and we periodically analyze the fair values of outstanding derivative contracts to determine their sensitivity to changes in exchange rates. We recognize revenue from product sales and collaborations by estimating rebates, chargebacks, discounts, and returns at the time of sale based on our historical rebate payments, contract terms, sales trends, and program structures and establish provisions for these reductions in the same period the related product sales are recognized. In our efforts to commercialize and manage our product portfolio, we face challenges and uncertainties inherent in reaching healthcare professionals, including digitally given the increase in virtual engagements.

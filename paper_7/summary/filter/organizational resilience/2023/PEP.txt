Our enterprise transformation initiatives recognize technology as a key enabler across our value chain, with investments in digital advancements such as AI-enabled drone scouting and weather stations to support sustainable agriculture, and a 2019 productivity plan that “leverages new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes” and “re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market.” We continuously monitor retail disruption—including the growth of e-commerce, online-to-offline integration, mobile commerce and subscription services—and are identifying actions to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities and expand our direct-to-consumer offerings. Information security and system resilience are integral to our integrated risk management framework, with the full Board and relevant committees receiving regular updates on cybersecurity matters—led by our Chief Information Security Officer—and overseeing risk mitigation for cyber incidents or other disruptions to our information systems. Our PepsiCo Risk Committee, which includes the head of Information Technology, and our Disclosure Committee, comprised of the General Counsel, Controller and senior leaders, both use these insights to maintain effective controls and support disclosure integrity.

During fiscal 2023, the company reported that online sales—those generated through its websites and mobile applications for store pickup or delivery—accounted for 14.8 percent of net sales and grew 1.1 percent year over year, reflecting ongoing investments in digital channels and supporting IT infrastructure. As part of its disciplined capital allocation framework, the company invested $3.2 billion in capital expenditures and plans to invest approximately $3.0 billion to $3.5 billion in fiscal 2024, with a stated focus on new store growth and improving the customer experience, including through technology and development of other differentiated capabilities. In addition, the company committed $1.5 billion to three acquisitions during fiscal 2023, which management describes as accelerating strategic initiatives and enhancing its ability to serve customers. Under its purchase obligations, legally binding contracts encompass software and license commitments as well as service contracts, illustrating ongoing resource deployment toward technology capabilities. The company’s inventory management methodology—valuing most inventory under the retail inventory method and adjusting retail values for current market conditions based on markups, markdowns and shrink estimates derived from physical counts—relies on information systems to enable accurate, timely and efficient monitoring of inventory levels and gross profit impacts.

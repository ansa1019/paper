Management’s discussion highlights that net sales include sales from e-commerce websites operating for more than one year and that our e-commerce business generally has a lower gross margin percentage than our warehouse operations, reflecting the strategic role of online offerings in adapting to vigorous competition and market dynamics. Capital expenditures are reported as primarily required for acquiring land, buildings and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses and are also required for information systems, with $4,323 million spent in fiscal 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses were positively impacted by eight basis points due to the prior year’s write-off of information technology assets, underscoring ongoing investments and adjustments in IT resources. Operating cash flow uses include payments for credit and debit card processing fees, indicative of digital transaction infrastructure costs. Membership fee revenue is accounted for on a deferred basis and recognized ratably over the one-year membership period, which relies on systems to manage revenue recognition and member data with the appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness and reliability.

The report does not contain a discrete section labeled “IT capability,” but it does describe substantial investments in communications and technology, reflected in a 6% increase in technology expense to $1.92 billion, to support critical information systems and software development, change management and infrastructure security measures. It details a formal governance structure—comprising a firmwide technology risk committee, an operational risk and resilience committee and a dedicated technology risk team under the chief information security officer—that oversees identity and access management, application and software security, data encryption, backup and restoration processes, mobile security and cloud computing controls. The firm’s vendor management program further ensures that third-party and cloud-hosted services comply with its security standards. These capabilities underpin its cybersecurity risk management program, its business continuity and crisis management planning, its liquidity and market‐risk stress testing applications, and its model review and validation processes, thereby integrating digital infrastructure, monitoring systems, data management and operational flexibility to coordinate internal processes, maintain connectivity and support resilience across its global businesses.

Our omnichannel investments enabled improved technology capabilities across our stores, as well as an enhanced customer experience, supporting both in-store and online value and convenience for price-conscious consumers while maintaining a balanced focus on profitability. Comparable sales include online sales, which positively impacted comparable sales by approximately 25 basis points in fiscal 2023 (45 basis points in fiscal 2022 and 150 basis points in fiscal 2021), reflecting the growing integration of digital channels with our traditional retail operations. Our perpetual productivity improvement initiatives provided us with the operational flexibility to control costs and respond to changes in demand, illustrating the deployment of scalable processes and resource allocation in support of evolving market conditions. Capital expenditures of $2.0 billion in fiscal 2023 primarily funded strategic initiatives to enhance our ability to serve customers, improve existing stores, and support expansion plansâ€”activities that inherently rely on robust information management, connectivity, and technology infrastructure to drive long-term competitive performance.

Qualcomm develops and commercializes foundational wireless and integrated circuit technologies used in mobile devices, automotive applications and the Internet of Things, deriving revenues from equipment and services, licensing its intellectual property and pursuing cloud computing processing initiatives, thereby mobilizing IT-based technology resources and capabilities—such as high-performance, low-power processing and on-device intelligence—to coordinate its internal R&D processes, supply-chain relationships and interfirm transactions. In fiscal 2023, R&D expenses increased by $624 million—driven by share-based compensation, deferred compensation revaluations and higher costs related to 5G and application-processor development—reflecting ongoing investment in technology deployment, process optimization and capability enhancement aligned with business strategies. In response to macroeconomic weakness, elevated customer inventories and supply-chain dynamics, the company initiated restructuring actions to reduce costs, reallocate resources toward growth and diversification opportunities, and sustain operational flexibility and competitive advantage. Looking forward, Qualcomm expects continued global ramp-up of 3G/4G/5G multimode and 5G products and services, noting that its technology platforms and licensing programs are critical to sustaining competitive positioning beyond handsets into automotive and IoT markets, and it continues to work with industry participants and regulators to promote its royalty-based licensing model and technology innovation. The company’s liquidity framework—including $8.5 billion in cash and equivalents, $2.9 billion in marketable securities, an unsecured commercial paper program and a $4.3 billion revolving credit facility—supports strategic investments, $1.5 billion of capital expenditures and $12.2 billion of semiconductor purchase commitments, thereby integrating financial activities with resource allocation. Qualcomm also monitors its non-marketable equity investments and inventories for impairment or valuation adjustments based on market conditions, applies lower-of-cost-or-net-realizable-value judgments to inventory, and conducts qualitative assessments of its reporting units’ fair values, demonstrating an information management capability to deliver timely, accurate and reliable data for strategic decision-making.

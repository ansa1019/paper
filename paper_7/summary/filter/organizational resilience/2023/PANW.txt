We empower enterprises, organizations, service providers, and government entities to protect themselves against today’s most sophisticated cyber threats, and our cybersecurity platforms and services help secure enterprise users, networks, clouds, and endpoints by delivering comprehensive cybersecurity backed by industry-leading artificial intelligence and automation. Our subscriptions provide our end-customers with near real-time access to the latest antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, modern malware prevention, data loss prevention, and cloud access security broker capabilities across the network, endpoints, and the cloud. Our network security platform, designed to deliver complete zero trust solutions, includes hardware and software ML-powered next-generation firewalls and a cloud-delivered secure access service edge (“SASE”); Prisma® Access, when combined with Prisma SD-WAN, provides a comprehensive single-vendor SASE offering that is used to secure remote workforces and enable the cloud-delivered branch, and Panorama®, our network security management solution, can centrally manage our network security platform irrespective of form factor, location, or scale. We enable cloud-native security through our Prisma Cloud platform, which as a comprehensive cloud native application protection platform (“CNAPP”) secures multi- and hybrid-cloud environments for applications, data, and the entire cloud native technology stack across the full development lifecycle, from code to runtime, supported further by our VM-series and CN-series virtual and container firewalls. We deliver the next generation of security automation, security analytics, endpoint security, and attack surface management solutions through our Cortex portfolio, and Unit 42 brings together world-renowned threat researchers with an elite team of incident responders and security consultants to create an intelligence-driven, response-ready organization to help customers proactively manage cyber risk by transforming their security strategy with a threat-informed approach. We believe that innovation and timely development of new features and products are essential to meeting the needs of our end-customers and improving our competitive position, and during fiscal 2023 we introduced offerings including Cortex XSIAM 1.0, major updates to Prisma Cloud (including three new security modules), Prisma Access 4.0, PAN-OS 11.0, Cloud NGFW for AWS, and Cloud NGFW for Azure; our December 2022 acquisition of Cider is expected to support our Prisma Cloud’s platform approach to securing the entire application security lifecycle from code to cloud. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner.

In 2023, we continued to prioritize relentless innovation, investing in technology and personnel within parameters consistent with long-term operating objectives, including software license and system maintenance fees, cloud computing costs and outsourced data center costs, payments to contractors, and data communications and other expenses associated with operating our services, which collectively resulted in information technology expenses of $655 million and depreciation and amortization increases driven by internally-developed and purchased software and computer equipment. Our mission to deliver a best-in-class experience through intuitive, easy-to-use online platforms and the “connected trip” vision—providing personalized online travel planning, booking, payment and in-trip services enhanced by a robust loyalty program—relies on robust digital infrastructure and mobile-optimized apps, where mobile bookings reached approximately 49% of room nights in 2023, reflecting our capability to tailor connectivity, security and user access in response to changing business needs. As part of our strategy to provide more payment options and secure, flexible transaction terms, booking.com has increasingly processed transactions on a merchant basis, driving additional investments in payment processing, fraud prevention systems, third-party call center capabilities and associated personnel expertise. Marketing efficiency also depends on advanced technology integrations across search engine keywords, affiliate programs and meta-search services to optimize conversion and performance marketing returns on investment. To support these digital technologies and IT architecture, we face intense competition for technology talent, leading to higher personnel expenses to attract and retain key employees critical for software development, data management, change management and process optimization. We plan to further broaden our technology resources and strategic resource allocation—including exploring acquisitions—to enhance our IT capability in mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources, transforming our business processes, and leveraging digital technologies to sustain competitive advantage and improve firm performance.

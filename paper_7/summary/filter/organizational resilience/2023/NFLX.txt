During the year ended December 31, 2023, the company continued to mobilize and deploy technology-based resources to support and enhance its streaming business by building and operating its global content delivery network (“Open Connect”)—incorporating equipment, personnel and third-party cloud computing costs to efficiently stream high volumes of content over the internet—and by maintaining investments in general use computer hardware and software. Technology and development expenses, reflecting payroll, stock-based compensation, facilities and related costs for engineering teams responsible for testing, maintaining and modifying the user interface, recommendation algorithms, merchandising tools and underlying infrastructure, remained relatively flat as a percentage of revenues, contributing to improvements in operating margin alongside revenue growth. The company’s internal systems leverage industry-standard geo-location technology to assign memberships to territories and manage plan and price variations in each market. These initiatives collectively illustrate the firm’s competence in coordinating IT resources and infrastructure to support business strategies, improve operational efficiency and enhance customer experience, consistent with its evolving ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure technology capabilities in support of its streaming services.

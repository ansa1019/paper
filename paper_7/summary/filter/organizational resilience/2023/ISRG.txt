Da Vinci surgical systems leverage computational, robotic and imaging technologies to overcome many limitations of traditional open surgery or conventional MIS, enabling surgeons to operate while seated at a console viewing a 3D high-definition image of the surgical field, with an immersive console that connects them to the surgical field and their instruments and filters out tremor. In designing our products, we focus on making our technology easy and safe to use, offering a holistic intelligent ecosystem in which robotic platforms, software, vision, energy, instruments and accessories work together to decrease variability by providing dependable, consistent functionality and an integrated user experience. Within this ecosystem our services offerings assist and optimize minimally invasive programs through readiness, on-demand support, consultation for program optimization and customized hospital analytics. We also provide a comprehensive suite of learning technologies, including educational simulation and telepresence tools, technical training programs and personalized peer-to-peer learning opportunities, such as remote case observation, telementoring and dual-console collaborative surgery. All Da Vinci systems include a surgeonâ€™s console, imaging electronics, a patient-side cart and computational hardware and software, and the vast majority of installed systems are connected via the internet (with system logs accessible even where connectivity is intermittent), enabling us to utilize information collected from installed systems, as well as customer agreements and discussions, to drive estimates and judgments for financial and operational decision-making.

Our MD&A highlights Lam Research’s core technical competency in integrating hardware, process, materials, software and process control to deliver high-precision wafer fabrication results and its customer support business group’s focus on products and services that maximize installed equipment performance, predictability and operational efficiency. During fiscal year 2023 we actively balanced customer requirements with resource availability and our operational and financial objectives, exercising discretion in the timing and prioritization of manufacturing and deliveries, which affected the timing of revenue recognition. We projected expenditures of approximately $250 million on business process improvements and initiatives, including restructuring actions to align cost structure, relocating certain manufacturing activities, moving inventory and equipment and exiting selected supplier arrangements to enhance operational flexibility. Early-year supply chain constraints were mitigated through coordinated fulfillment of nearly all outstanding back orders, demonstrating our agility in addressing changing market demands. Continued R&D investments in leading-edge deposition, etch and clean process technologies—driven by increased headcount, deferred compensation plan-related costs, supplies spending and depreciation—underscore our commitment to innovation and efficiency. Finally, forecasted operating cash flows, combined with substantial liquidity and access to capital markets, are expected to support our operations, strategic technology investments, debt service, capital expenditures, and dividends, thereby reinforcing our ability to mobilize, deploy and reconfigure resources and information systems in response to evolving business needs and industry inflections.

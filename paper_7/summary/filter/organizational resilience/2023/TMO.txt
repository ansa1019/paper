The company defines its strategic growth investments as targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, research and development projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience. Its references to productivity improvements generally describe improved cost efficiencies from its practical process improvement (PPI) business system, including continuous improvement methodologies, global sourcing initiatives, and a lower cost structure following restructuring actions such as headcount reductions and facility consolidations. The companyâ€™s investing activities include acquisitions and purchases of $1.48 billion of property, plant and equipment for capacity and capability investments, with expected 2024 capital expenditures, net of disposals, of $1.3 to $1.5 billion. It deploys capital primarily via mergers and acquisitions and secondarily via share buybacks and dividends, uses non-U.S. cash for acquisitions, capacity expansion and third-party debt repayment, and maintains access to a $5 billion unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility to support operational and financial flexibility. Recent acquisitions of the Binding Site Group and Corevitas, LLC expand the portfolio with diagnostic instruments and real-world evidence solutions to enhance decision-making and streamline drug development, implicitly underscoring the coordination of assets, processes and interfirm relationships through integrated systems and infrastructure.

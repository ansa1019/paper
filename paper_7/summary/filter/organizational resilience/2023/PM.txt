Since 2008, the company has invested $12.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products, including the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities in pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research and post-market studies, illustrating its commitment to mobilize and deploy specialized resources and enhance internal processes; the November 2022 acquisition of Swedish Match AB and the simultaneous creation of a global smoke-free combination led by the IQOS and ZYN brands reflect the firm’s intentional integration of physical and intangible assets, management skills and interfirm relationships to accelerate product innovation and competitive positioning; in January 2023 the company reorganized its business into four geographical operating segments (Europe; South and Southeast Asia, Commonwealth of Independent States, Middle East and Africa; East Asia, Australia and PMI Duty Free; and Americas) plus its Swedish Match and Wellness and Healthcare segments, and plans to fold Swedish Match results into the four regional segments in the first quarter of 2024, demonstrating a strategic reconfiguration of governance contexts, resource deployment and reporting structures to support coordinated decision-making and market responsiveness; ongoing assessments of the operating environment in Ukraine and Russia have led to adaptive supply chain and contract manufacturing arrangements, a $30 million investment in a new production facility in Lviv and continuous evaluation of regulatory constraints for potential divestment, underscoring the firm’s dynamic allocation of capital and management of external influences to preserve operational flexibility; and the termination of the commercial relationship with Altria Group, Inc. to secure full U.S. rights to commercialize IQOS, together with the end of distribution arrangements in the Middle East, exemplify strategic resource reconfiguration and partnership realignment aimed at reinforcing the company’s competitive advantage and strategic alignment in key markets.

Mastercard is described as a “technology company in the global payments industry” that “connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide by enabling electronic payments and making those payment transactions safe, simple, smart, and accessible.” The company operates a “unique and proprietary core global payments network” to “switch (authorize, clear and settle) payment transactions” and leverages additional multi-rail capabilities—including automated clearing house transactions in both batch and real-time—to offer payment products and capture new payment flows. Its value-added services encompass “cyber and intelligence solutions designed to allow all parties to transact securely, easily and with confidence,” as well as services providing proprietary insights through principled and responsible use of secure consumer and merchant data. Strategic investments in new networks such as open banking solutions and digital identity capabilities support and strengthen its payments and services solutions, illustrating the firm’s ability to deploy, combine and reconfigure technology resources, processes and governance structures in support of business strategies. Each capability “supports and builds upon each other and [is] fundamentally interdependent,” governed by a franchise model that balances value and risk, enables interoperability among stakeholders and employs a multi-layered approach to protect the global payments ecosystem. The increase in software capitalization and related depreciation and amortization further reflects ongoing investment in IT infrastructure and systems to drive growth, operational efficiency and process optimization.

Visa is a global payments technology company that facilitates global commerce and money movement across more than 200 countries and territories among a global set of consumers, merchants, financial institutions and government entities through innovative technologies. We provide transaction processing services (primarily authorization, clearing and settlement) to our financial institution and merchant clients through VisaNet, our proprietary advanced transaction processing network, and we offer products, solutions and services that facilitate secure, reliable and efficient money movement for all participants in the ecosystem. Data processing revenues increased primarily due to 10% growth in processed transactions, select pricing modifications and growth in value-added services, underscoring the scaling of our digital technology functionalities. Network and processing expenses mainly represent expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services, while depreciation and amortization expenses include amortization of internally developed and purchased software and finite-lived intangible assets such as developed technology acquired in business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs, including technology integration fees, associated with our business combinations, reflecting our approach to deploy and reconfigure IT resources in support of strategic initiatives. In June 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Pismo Holdings (Pismo), a cloud-native issuer processing and core banking platform, for $1.0 billion in cash, subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory reviews and approvals, to enhance our digital infrastructure and extend our organizational capabilities. This integrated technology infrastructure and ongoing IT investment underpin our ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with, and leveraging the value of, other resources and capabilities to support business strategies, optimize operations, and coordinate internal processes and interfirm relationships, transforming Visa into a competitive force in the global payments landscape.

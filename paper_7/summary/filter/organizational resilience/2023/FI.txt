The Company discloses that its competitive positioning and operational performance rely on robust information technology capabilities, encompassing account processing, digital banking, card issuer processing, network services, e-commerce, merchant acquiring and processing, and cloud-based point-of-sale and integrated commerce operating systems such as Clover® and CaratSM. The Fintech segment provides technology solutions that enable financial institutions to process customer deposit and loan accounts, manage general ledger and central information files, and access digital banking, financial and risk management, professional services and consulting, while the Payments segment delivers comprehensive digital payment transaction processing—including debit, credit, prepaid and non-card payment software and network services—augmented by security and fraud protection products and card production services. Investment in IT resources and infrastructure is emphasized through capital expenditures, including capitalized software and other intangibles representing approximately 7–8% of revenue, and through the acquisition of cloud-native platforms like Finxact to advance digital transformation and expand account processing, digital and payments solutions. Merchant and financial institution clients’ demands for simpler, integrated and flexible omnichannel systems to support evolving consumer payment preferences, real-time commerce, regulatory compliance and enhanced customer experience have led the Company to invest in modernizing its technology, expanding the use of data and integrating platforms and value-added solutions, including partnerships with independent software vendors to cross-sell software-as-a-service offerings. Its revenue recognition framework treats software license, hardware (POS device) sales and software customization or hosted licensed software as separate performance obligations, enabling precise allocation of transaction prices and reflecting the embedding of third-party technology components in its applications and service offerings. The Company believes that economies of scale in developing and maintaining its technology infrastructure, products, services and networks are essential to deliver data and information with the appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security and confidentiality, to enhance operational efficiency, to provide scalable stand-ready service arrangements, and to drive innovation across its global payments landscape.

Gilead’s annual report describes a structured approach to allocating and deploying organizational resources—both internal and external—to support its strategic priorities, including the identification, prioritization and reallocation of R&D activities based on scientific data, regulatory probability and market potential; ongoing investments in “infrastructure, materials and supplies and other support costs” to maintain operational flexibility; systematic evaluation of liquidity and capital resources, including use of foreign currency hedging contracts, to coordinate financial assets and manage risk exposures; reliance on acquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements to integrate externally developed research projects and expand its interfirm relationships; and continual review of its R&D portfolio against evolving medical needs and business objectives, all of which imply underlying processes for information management, decision-making, resource integration and process optimization that are characteristic of a firm’s evolving IT capability.

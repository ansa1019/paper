The report describes a range of measures and decision processes that support the company’s capacity to absorb strain, adapt to internal and external variations and preserve or improve functioning in the face of pressures, constraints, disruptions and uncertainties. Management notes that our success “depends on our ability of our people to execute effectively every day” and that our objective is to deploy our assets—brands, financial strength, unrivaled distribution system, global reach and the talent and strong commitment of our management and associates—to become more competitive and to accelerate growth in a manner that creates value for shareowners, reflecting a systemic perspective on resilience. We have established a formal water risk management program and stewardship framework that include water-use efficiency, wastewater treatment, watershed protection, community engagement and supply-chain practices to mitigate environmental perturbations and protect a critical natural resource. We are committed to sustainable sourcing and joint efforts with farmers, communities, bottlers, suppliers and partners, as well as ongoing investment in sustainable agriculture, in order to address commodity shortages and food-security challenges. A global productivity and reinvestment program, now extended through 2019, is focused on supply-chain optimization, marketing and innovation effectiveness, operating expense leverage, IT and data-systems standardization and integration of bottling operations, with incremental savings reinvested in consumer-facing marketing and supported by a leaner operating model, enabling services organization and corporate center of excellence. We also invest in infrastructure programs with bottlers to strengthen the bottling system and capitalize prepayments for distribution rights and marketing to generate profitable volume, assessing recoverability of these assets against future cash flows consistent with our planning. Rigorous product safety, quality and integrated quality-management standards identify and mitigate risks and drive continuous improvement across more than 200 countries and have been complemented by disciplined accounting policies for asset impairments, goodwill and intangible rights, each tested for impairment when conditions indicate potential loss of integrity or performance. These combined strategic initiatives, risk assessments, resource allocations, adaptation strategies and collaboration networks constitute the company’s multifaceted approach to preserving integrity and supporting positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

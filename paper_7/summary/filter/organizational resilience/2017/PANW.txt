Our platform enables end-customers to maintain the visibility and control needed to protect their valued data and critical control systems while pursuing technology initiatives, like cloud and mobility, that grow their business. We continue to invest in and extend our platform, as we believe that innovation and timely development of new features and products is essential to meeting the needs of our end-customers and improving our competitive position, as demonstrated by the launch of new physical and virtual firewall form-factors, cloud-based subscriptions, and behavioral analytics capabilities. We monitor key financial metrics, including deferred revenue—primarily subscription and support revenue recognized ratably over contractual service periods—and billings, which we view as an important indicator of the health and visibility of our hybrid SaaS revenue model, and we believe our cash flow from operations, together with existing cash and investments, will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future. We believe that the growth of our business and our short-term and long-term success are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to extend our technology leadership, grow our base of end-customers, expand deployment of our platform and support offerings within existing end-customers, and focus on end-customer satisfaction. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts and sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and subscription and support offerings, investments in complementary businesses and technologies, our manufacturing capacity, and the continuing market acceptance of our offerings. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all, and if we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected. Critical accounting estimates related to revenue recognition, uncertain tax positions, manufacturing partner and supplier liabilities, and evaluation of long-lived assets and goodwill further illustrate our processes for maintaining integrity and performance while under internal or external variations and disturbances.

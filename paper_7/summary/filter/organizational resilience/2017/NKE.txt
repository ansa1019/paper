During fiscal 2017, we continued to drive long-term revenue growth and protect profitability through strategies that embody organizational resilience, including investing in our supply chain as a competitive advantage by deploying new technologies to increase automation, reduce waste, accelerate speed to market and enhance product customization; launching the consumer direct offense to leverage digital capabilities, accelerate innovation and deepen one-to-one connections with consumers at scale; optimizing selling and administrative expenses through disciplined investments in consumer engagement that drive incremental revenue and gross profit, infrastructure enhancements that improve operational efficiency and targeted funding of future growth in direct-to-consumer channels; rigorously managing working capital efficiency and deploying capital effectively; and maintaining robust liquidity via cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, a committed $2 billion credit facility and a commercial paper program. These measures enabled us to absorb foreign currency headwinds, preserving gross margin and EBIT despite a $542 million adverse translation impact on revenues and a $115 million adverse impact on income before taxes, by centralizing foreign exchange risk management, leveraging natural offsets within our portfolio of exposures and selectively using forward contracts and options to mitigate transactional and translational risks. Through these operational, financial and risk-mitigation actions, we absorbed strain and preserved or improved our functioning in the face of external variations and disturbances, demonstrating the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions and the ability to emerge stronger from adversity.

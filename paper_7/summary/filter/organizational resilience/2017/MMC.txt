The company’s organizational resilience is reflected in its risk and insurance services segment, which encompasses “risk management activities (risk advice, risk transfer and risk control and mitigation solutions)” alongside insurance and reinsurance broking and services designed to absorb strain and preserve performance under adverse market and regulatory pressures, and in its consulting segment, which adapts to shifts in global economic conditions, industry trends, government policies and market volatility by developing and integrating new offerings—most notably the January 1, 2017 combination of Mercer’s investment and retirement businesses into a unified wealth business to align capabilities and improve service innovation. The firm sustains operational continuity and financial flexibility through diversified revenue streams across more than 130 countries, regular repatriation of non-U.S. earnings balanced against regulatory and collateral requirements, active management of liquidity via a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, and strategic debt issuances and maturities, all of which support its capacity to reconfigure resources, respond to tax reform under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and optimize its global capital strategy. Resilience is further bolstered by disciplined acquisitions—seven in 2017 and nine in 2016—aligning resource allocation with long-term objectives; rigorous pension plan governance, including plan amendments, actuarial remeasurement upon benefit freezes in Canada, the U.K. and the U.S., and targeted contributions to maintain funded status; structured share repurchase and dividend programs to sustain shareholder value under fluctuating market conditions; segregated fiduciary funds to ensure client asset protection and business continuity; and proactive legal and loss-contingency processes employing internal actuarial modeling and counsel reviews to assess and mitigate errors and omissions exposures, thereby preserving system integrity and maintaining positive adjustment amid evolving external disturbances.

Management’s discussion and analysis highlights the strength of our global business model and our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions through disciplined investments in our business and our partners, including increased partner (employee) and digital investments, strategic restructuring and impairment charges related to the repositioning of underperforming businesses such as Teavana and the divestiture of our Singapore retail operations. We returned $3.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends to maintain financial flexibility and reconfigured resources to focus on high-growth opportunities, while committing approximately $2 billion of capital expenditures in new and existing stores, our developing Siren Retail business, and our supply chain and corporate facilities to strengthen operational continuity and adaptability. To mitigate exposure to external disturbances such as commodity price volatility and foreign currency fluctuations, we employ pricing features in supply contracts and derivative instruments under a market price risk management policy with strict risk limits and counterparty credit risk controls. We actively manage cash and investments to fund operating needs, service debt, complete strategic acquisitions including the pending purchase of our East China joint venture, and pursue other corporate initiatives, leveraging our balance sheet to ensure sufficient liquidity. Looking ahead to fiscal 2018, we will undertake strategic initiatives—including accelerating comparable store sales, driving food and beverage innovation, expanding our digital platform, elevating the Starbucks experience through Siren Retail, and expanding licensed operations in China—while exiting certain underperforming activities through store closures and brand asset sales to reconfigure our trajectory toward sustained performance under nominal, extreme, and exceptional conditions. Our critical accounting policies for asset impairment, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, and income tax valuations involve ongoing qualitative and quantitative assessments of future cash flows, market multiples, discount rates, and tax environments, underscoring our systemic approach to preserving integrity and performance amid evolving economic and operational pressures.

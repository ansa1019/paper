In 2017, Union Pacific pursued a multi‐faceted safety strategy—leveraging technology, risk assessment, training, employee engagement and targeted capital investments through initiatives such as Courage to Care, Total Safety Culture and UP Way—to reduce risk, eliminate incidents and preserve operational continuity despite disruptions from events such as Hurricane Harvey and the continued implementation and testing of positive train control across an expanding network. The company aligned resources with customer demand, maintained network fluidity by ensuring surge capability of assets, and advanced capacity investments—renewing and improving existing infrastructure, constructing a new classification yard, and acquiring locomotives, intermodal containers and chassis—to sustain service innovation, productivity and adaptability. Financial resilience was underscored by generating $2.2 billion of free cash flow, achieving a record 63.0 percent adjusted operating ratio, remeasuring deferred tax assets and liabilities under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and maintaining access to liquidity through cash, receivables securitization, revolving credit, commercial paper and other capital market financings. Labor relations proceeded under the Railway Labor Act through mediation and negotiation with major rail unions, avoiding work stoppages and ensuring workforce readiness. Management provided for personal injury, environmental and other liabilities using actuarial analyses and accruals to absorb strain and preserve firm performance under both nominal and extreme conditions. Depreciation studies and a projected $3.3 billion 2018 capital plan demonstrated adaptive resource allocation and system integrity, while expectations of margin improvement driven by core pricing gains, productivity initiatives and resource leverage reflect strategic foresight and operational flexibility. Together, these measures constitute a coordinated resilience strategy enabling the organization to absorb disturbances, reconfigure operations and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

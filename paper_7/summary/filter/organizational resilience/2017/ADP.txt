During fiscal 2017, the Company reinforced its ability to preserve and improve its performance under adverse conditions by investing to strengthen its underlying business model and prospects for sustainable long-term growth, driving product innovation and service enhancements, and executing a disciplined strategy for profitable growth while maintaining shareholder-friendly actions; it continued upgrading clients from legacy platforms to its cloud-based solutions to improve client experience, aligned its client service operations through a multi-year service alignment initiative and workforce optimization effort, and completed the disposition of non-core businesses to sharpen focus on core capabilities, all of which reflect an organizational change process designed to absorb strain and preserve functioning; the acquisition of The Marcus Buckingham Company further deepened talent management technology, coaching and consulting capabilities, illustrating resource allocation toward innovation and knowledge absorption; operational improvements—evidenced by stable recurring revenues, healthy cash flows, strong client retention and low capital expenditure requirements—together with investments in its sales force and service organization enabled the Company to anticipate external pressures, respond effectively to regulatory complexity and system interruptions, and maintain business continuity; risk mitigation measures include compliance monitoring, security and privacy breach prevention, diversified investment portfolios for both corporate and funds-held-for-clients assets with safety of principal and liquidity objectives, reinsurance arrangements to limit workers’ compensation exposure, and access to $9.5 billion in committed credit facilities, as well as short-term commercial paper and reverse repurchase agreements, to ensure adequate liquidity and operational flexibility under varying market and interest-rate environments; in addition, the use of derivative instruments when appropriate, ongoing analysis of credit and market risk, and enhancements in financial and tax planning all support the Company’s capacity to adapt, reconfigure its strategic trajectories and emerge stronger from challenging situations.

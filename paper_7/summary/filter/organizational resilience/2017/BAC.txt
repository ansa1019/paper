Bank of America describes its capacity to absorb strain and maintain functioning under challenging conditions through a comprehensive risk and capital framework overseen by the board and the enterprise risk committee, which annually approve a risk appetite statement, strategic plan, capital plan and liquidity guidelines designed to align resources with objectives and authorize contingency strategies.  The corporation conducts periodic stress forecasting and capital scenario management, maintains a liquidity buffer of high-quality, liquid unencumbered assets, and holds diversified funding sources—including deposits, secured and unsecured debt—organized through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach to ensure operational continuity in stressed market environments.  Contingency funding plans, recovery plans and a single-point-of-entry resolution strategy are tested to validate readiness and guided by defined escalation routines, allowing the parent company and key subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent obligations without new issuances under liquidity stress.  Interest rate, foreign-exchange and other derivative contracts are employed to hedge variability in cash flows and fair-value positions, while mortgage servicing rights and loan repurchase commitments are similarly hedged to preserve performance.  Key roles and responsibilities are assigned across three lines of defense—front-line units, independent risk management and corporate audit—within a culture of proactive risk identification, measurement, monitoring and control, complemented by rigorous model validation and operational risk management processes.  Collectively, these policies, limits, governance structures and stress-testing regimes support the bank’s resilient adjustment to internal and external disturbances and underpin its ability to preserve or improve performance under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

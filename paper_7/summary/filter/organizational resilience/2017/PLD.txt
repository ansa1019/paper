Management reports that operating fundamentals remained strong for our owned and managed portfolio and we ended the year with occupancy of 97.2%, reflecting the maintenance of performance despite external variations. In 2017, we completed several transactions that repositioned our portfolio and streamlined our co-investment ventures—selling investments, forming new joint ventures, contributing properties and acquiring partners’ interests—demonstrating adaptive resource reconfiguration. We amended our Japanese yen revolver, increased borrowing capacity to ¥50.0 billion and issued £500 million of senior notes to extend maturities and lower interest costs, underscoring financial flexibility and risk mitigation. We evaluate segment performance based on net operating income and conduct same store analyses, using metrics such as rent rate growth, development stabilization and customer retention exceeding 75%, to support business continuity and systematic monitoring of operating resilience. Our strategic capital segment allocates management fees and promotes to align incentives, while foreign currency and derivative programs manage exchange rate fluctuations. Critical accounting judgments—on impairment recoverability assessments, purchase price allocations upon acquisitions and revenue recognition for contributions to co-investment ventures—reflect organizational intelligence and preparedness. Through proactive liquidity management, diversified funding sources and contractual and off-balance sheet commitments in unconsolidated ventures, we maintain our ability to absorb strain, adapt to market turbulence and preserve organizational health to emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

Microsoft acknowledges that its industry is “dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models,” regarding each shift as “an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas” and investing in research and development activities to address “the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.” The company recognizes the necessity “to continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment,” as demonstrated by its July 2015 and May 2016 plans to restructure and streamline its phone business “to better focus and align resources,” the December 2016 acquisition of LinkedIn, and the divestiture of its feature phone business. Its strategy to build “best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence” and its investments in infrastructure and devices reflect efforts to enhance operational flexibility, support business continuity, and allocate resources toward growth areas. Microsoft’s use of derivative instruments “to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; enhance investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification,” alongside its maintenance of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities for liquidity and capital preservation, underscores its risk mitigation and resource allocation mechanisms. The company’s liquidity management—including the expectation that “existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets” will suffice for funding operating activities and commitments and contingency plans to repatriate earnings or raise capital if necessary—further illustrates its strategies to preserve performance and integrity under external pressures.

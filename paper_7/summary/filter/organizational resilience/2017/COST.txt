The company states that it “has been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private label items” and generates comparable sales growth by “making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices” while maintaining a perception of “pricing authority,” including reducing prices to drive sales or holding prices steady despite cost increases; its membership format “is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue,” recognized ratably over one year, and management believes that “achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce,” supporting operational continuity. The firm operates “our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada, and other international operating segments,” pursues warehouse expansion—opening 26 net new warehouses in 2017 and planning up to 24 in 2018—financed “with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments,” and “maintains bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes” alongside short-term indebtedness and liquidity reserves. The company’s information systems modernization, “including increased depreciation for projects placed in service,” its annual evaluation of long-lived assets “when relocating or closing a facility, or when events or changes in circumstances occur that may indicate the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable,” and its predominantly self-insured risk management using historical claims experience and actuarial assumptions reflect its capacity to absorb strain, reconfigure resources, and preserve or improve functioning amid economic, competitive, and operational disruptions.

Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis describes a range of strategic and operational measures that collectively support the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity. We monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis and assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues, and as a result of these assessments we have undertaken various restructuring actions, including an early retirement offer and reduction of operating costs, which we expect will result in estimated annual salary, variable compensation and employee benefit savings and which we plan to reallocate toward investments in products to drive future revenue growth. The acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation, financed through existing cash, bridge and term loan facilities, the issuance of senior unsecured notes and our revolving credit facility, reflects resource generation and deployment under external pressures, while our repayment of bridge and term loans demonstrates our operational flexibility and commitment to business continuity. We manage liquidity and risk through maintenance of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, diversification among high credit quality counterparties to minimize credit risk, and ongoing compliance with debt covenants, which together we believe will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and dividend payments for at least the next twelve months. Inventory and receivables levels are actively balanced against production, demand and obsolescence risk through lower-of-cost-or-market valuations and allowances for doubtful accounts, and revenue recognition policies—including deferral of revenue and related cost of sales on shipments to distributors until end-customer sales and careful allocation of consideration among deliverables—are subject to continuous system enhancements and an upcoming transition to the new revenue standard, evidencing our adaptability to regulatory and market disruptions. We periodically review long-lived assets and goodwill for recoverability and perform impairment testing using discounted cash flow and market approaches, and we manage uncertain tax positions through “more likely than not” thresholds and valuation allowances, thereby reinforcing our systemic integrity, risk mitigation capabilities and resilience in the face of internal or external variations and disturbances.

Management discusses how volatility and uncertainty in macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations create external pressures on its business environment and emphasizes its ongoing monitoring of these conditions and cost-management actions to respond effectively to changing circumstances, thereby preserving its operational continuity. The Company proactively plans and manages the size and composition of its workforce—adjusting hiring levels, attrition and compensation—to keep its supply of skills and resources in balance with shifts in client demand and to maintain service delivery capabilities under challenging conditions. Pricing stability and margin maintenance are pursued by adjusting pricing and/or the mix of resources to mitigate the impact of compensation increases on gross margin, reflecting a dynamic resource allocation strategy. To absorb financial strain and preserve performance despite currency variations, the Company employs hedging programs and currency protection provisions in customer contracts to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as related revenues. Its liquidity and capital resource strategy—which includes maintaining substantial cash reserves, available borrowing facilities, potential access to commercial paper and syndicated credit lines, and the flexibility to accelerate, suspend or discontinue share repurchases—underscores its ability to generate and reconfigure financial resources to support strategic initiatives, acquisitions and dividend payments under diverse market scenarios. Contract management practices, including percentage-of-completion accounting, continuous reassessment of contract profitability, loss provisions for contracts where losses are probable, deferral and amortization of transition costs in outsourcing arrangements, and impairment testing of unbilled services, illustrate systematic approaches to absorb strain, preserve integrity and maintain performance under evolving project scopes, incentives and client terminations. Investments in digital, cloud and security services and the transformation of operating group structures to capture convergence in communications, media and technology industries exemplify the Company’s adaptive trajectory toward emerging disruptive events and its focus on sustaining competitive resilience through service innovation and operational flexibility.

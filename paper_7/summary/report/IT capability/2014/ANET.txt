At the core of our cloud networking platform is EOS, a fully programmable, highly modular operating system that delivers industry-leading performance, scalability, availability, programmability, automation and visibility and enables the creation of software applications for workflow automation, network visibility and analytics as well as rapid integration with a wide range of third-party applications for virtualization, management, automation, orchestration and network services. Our development model combines EOS software with merchant silicon into a family of switching products, allowing us to leverage third-party technology resources and focus our research and development on software core competencies to achieve cost-effective solutions. In order to support our strong growth and improve operational efficiency, we have accelerated our investment in infrastructure, including enterprise resource planning software and other technologies, which underpins process optimization, organizational effectiveness and the coordination of our assets, internal processes and interfirm relationships. We continue to invest heavily in software development—incurring personnel costs, prototype expenses, third-party engineering and contractor support, and an allocated portion of facility and IT infrastructure costs—to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership. Our sales organization is supported by systems engineers with deep technical expertise responsible for pre-sales technical support and engineering, and we have established the Arista Partner Program to facilitate channel coordination, extend our reach in key geographies and integrate partner-provided value-added services into our value chain. These disclosures reflect our competence in acquiring, deploying, integrating and reconfiguring IT-based resources in combination with other organizational capabilities to support business strategies, operational flexibility and firm performance.

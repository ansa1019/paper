Data processing and telecommunications expense consists of costs to support Mastercard’s global payments network infrastructure, operate and maintain its computer and telecommunication systems and expand capacity in response to business growth, while connectivity fees—based on the size of data transmitted and the number of network connections—underpin the network access, equipment and transmission of authorization and settlement messages. Transaction switching services, including authorization routing, “stand-in” approvals when issuer systems are unavailable, clearing through central and regional processing systems and settlement facilitation, are enabled by these systems, and revenue recognition relies on transactional information accumulated by those systems or reported by customers. Fraud products and services leverage electronic warning bulletins to prevent or detect fraudulent transactions, and Mastercard acknowledges that information security risks for global payments and technology companies have significantly increased with no assurance of immunity from cyber-attacks or infrastructure breaches. These capabilities are further supported by targeted investments to support strategic initiatives, the integration of acquired businesses and enhancements to system capacity and operational resilience.

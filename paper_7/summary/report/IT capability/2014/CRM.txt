We are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions with a scalable multi-tenant architecture delivered via all major Internet browsers and mobile operating systems, offering core CRM, analytics and community clouds that leverage platform capabilities developed internally and through acquisitions. We continue to expand and reconfigure our global infrastructure by investing in additional data center capacity, development and test data centers, network connectivity and information technology infrastructure to enhance the availability, performance, security, scalability and reliability of our services. We allocate overhead such as IT infrastructure, rent and occupancy based on headcount, while cost of revenues includes hosting, data center capacity, depreciation of computer equipment and software, amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs and acquired developed technologies, and third-party licensing and data fees. Our research and development expenses primarily comprise salaries, stock-based compensation, development/test data center costs and allocated overhead to add new features, integrate acquired technologies, improve functionality, security and ease of use, and upgrade internal systems to scale operations. We derive revenues from subscription and support services recognized ratably over 12- to 60-month contracts, together with professional services such as process mapping, project management and implementation services that facilitate customer adoption and generate deferred revenue and deferred commissions amortized over contract terms. Key strategic initiatives include strengthening market-leading solutions, extending distribution into new categories, pursuing new customers, reducing attrition, upgrading customers to enterprise licenses, investing in customer success and third-party application development on our cloud platforms. To fund these initiatives and meet growth plans—including office build-outs, leasehold improvements, technology acquisitions, strategic investments in complementary businesses, joint ventures and intellectual property—we use cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, a revolving credit facility for working capital and permitted acquisitions, and we have contractual lease commitments for office space, co-location data centers and equipment. The seasonal nature of annual subscription billing results in billing concentration in the fourth quarter and operating cash flow concentration in the first quarter. Ongoing investments in IT resources, organizational capabilities, process optimization and strategic acquisitions underpin our ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources in support and enhancement of our business strategies and to transform the firm into a competitive force.

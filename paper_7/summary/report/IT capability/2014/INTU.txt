Management’s discussion emphasizes that as the Company continues transitioning to offer more connected services, “the ongoing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important,” and accordingly “we are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.” Because the Company helps customers manage their financial lives, it “faces risks associated with the hosting, collection, use and retention of personal customer information and data,” and in May 2009 “entered into an agreement to license certain technology for $20 million in cash and $100 million payable over ten fiscal years.” In August 2014 the Company announced that “we will begin delivering ongoing releases for our future desktop offerings in order to improve the product experience, accommodate operating system updates, and provide access to connected services,” a decision that will affect the timing of revenue recognition. In cost of revenue disclosures the Company notes that “cost of service and other revenue…includes direct costs associated with providing services, including data center costs related to delivering online services,” and in its intangible asset accounting “amortization of acquired technology…represents the cost of amortizing developed technologies that we have obtained through acquisitions over their useful lives.”

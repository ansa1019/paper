Microsoft positions its evolving IT capability as central to its mobile-first, cloud-first strategy, describing how it has expanded to encompass the coordination of a firm’s assets, internal processes, and interfirm transactions through the development, deployment, and integration of software products, cloud-based services, and devices. The company states that it “creates technology that transforms the way people work, play, and communicate,” and “seeks to identify and address the changing demands of customers, industry trends, and competitive forces” by investing research and development resources in digital work and life experiences, its cloud operating system, and device operating systems and hardware. Microsoft highlights its ability to “deliver digital work and life experiences that are reinvented for the mobile-first and cloud-first world” with a portfolio of productivity, collaboration, and business process tools designed to partition data between work and life while respecting privacy choices, enable friction-free application discovery and purchase, and ensure content and services follow users across ecosystems and devices. The MD&A underscores how enterprises “deploy technology that advances business strategy” through Microsoft’s cloud platform—Azure and Windows Server—and its datacenters, which leverage economies of scale to improve utilization of computing, storage, and network resources, lower maintenance labor costs, and enable secure, hybrid infrastructures with common security, management, and administration across environments. The report further details the extension of software-as-a-service applications into existing security and management infrastructures, the introduction of higher-level services including identity, directory, analytics, machine learning, media, web and mobile backend, and developer productivity services, and the fostering of an extensible developer ecosystem to “customize and enhance our solutions, achieving even more value.” In its devices and consumer segment, Microsoft describes efforts to “set the standard for productivity experiences” by investing to make Windows “the most secure, manageable, and capable operating system” across screens of all sizes and to develop universal applications, new input/output methods, and first-party hardware such as Surface, thereby mobilizing and deploying technology resources in combination with partners. The MD&A also acknowledges the need to “evolve and adapt” in a dynamic, highly competitive environment and describes a restructuring plan intended to “increase agility, streamline engineering processes, move faster and more efficiently, and simplify our organization,” all reflecting the firm’s approach to mobilizing IT-based resources to support and enhance business strategies, work processes, and operational flexibility.

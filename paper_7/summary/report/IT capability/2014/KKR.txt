KKR’s operations rely on substantial investments in communications and information services to support its integrated global investment platform and worldwide network of business relationships, which provide significant data inputs and specialized knowledge during due diligence and risk monitoring; the firm draws on timely and diverse economic information—from sources such as the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Eurostat, national statistics and IMF forecasts—to inform its investment strategies and reporting, and it incurs professional fees for information services and monitoring systems that manage risk and coordinate internal processes; although not labeled as such, these elements—spanning data management, connectivity, analytics and technology infrastructure—underpin KKR’s ability to adapt its investment strategies to changing market conditions, deliver tailored solutions to fund investors and portfolio companies, and mobilize its technology-based resources in support and enhancement of its global business operations.

Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to run our technology infrastructure and to build, enhance, and add features to our websites, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings, as well as to build and optimize our fulfillment centers. We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees, and our technology and content investment and capital‐spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross‐functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to efficiently invest in areas such as web services, expansion of new and existing product categories and offerings, and initiatives to expand our ecosystem of digital products and services, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology—specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and developments in wireless connectivity—will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives, and to best take advantage of these advances we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We are also investing in AWS, which provides technology services that give developers and enterprises of all sizes access to scalable technology infrastructure that enables virtually any type of business. Technology costs consist principally of research and development activities, including payroll and related expenses for employees involved in application, production, maintenance, operation, and platform development for new and existing products and services, as well as AWS and other technology infrastructure expenses, while content costs consist principally of payroll and related expenses for employees involved in category expansion, editorial content, buying, and merchandising selection. For 2014, 2013, and 2012, we capitalized $641 million (including $104 million of stock‐based compensation), $581 million (including $87 million of stock‐based compensation), and $454 million (including $74 million of stock‐based compensation) of costs associated with internal‐use software and website development, and amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $559 million, $451 million, and $327 million for those years, respectively.

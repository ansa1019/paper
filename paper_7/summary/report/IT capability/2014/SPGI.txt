S&P Capital IQ is described as a global provider of multi-asset-class data, research and analytical capabilities, which integrate cross-asset analytics and desktop services, with its RatingsXpress® platform continuing to benefit from improvements in speed and timeliness through the Xpressfeed platform and a 3% increase in customers in 2014. Operating-related expenses at S&P Ratings, S&P Capital IQ and C&C increased primarily due to higher technology costs and an uptick in compensation expenses, and the operating profit improvements at S&P Capital IQ were partially offset by elevated technology spending amid the closure of non-core businesses. Management highlights that S&P Capital IQ has focused on integrating and evolving its assets and capabilities into one scaled business, building new functionality to fill critical capability gaps, and pursuing acquisitions designed to bolster its technology resource base—such as Credit Market Analysis Limited, Quanthouse’s low-latency market data solutions, and R2 Technologies’ advanced risk and scenario-based analytics—while seeking to expand key data sets, tools and analytics and grow revenues outside the U.S. by addressing data gaps in key markets. Consistent with an emphasis on IT architecture optimization, the company streamlined its infrastructure by reducing its real estate footprint, selling its data facility, consolidating corporate headquarters and divesting its data center to Quality Technology Services, LLC, and recorded related non-cash impairment charges. The company also discloses off-balance-sheet commitments for information-technology outsourcing and enterprise-wide software licensing and maintenance. In its commodities & commercial segment, management plans to invest in digital capabilities to integrate its brands into customer workflows, drive competitive advantage and establish a foundation for new product and revenue streams.

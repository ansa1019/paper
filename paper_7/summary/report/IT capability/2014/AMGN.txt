Amgen is advancing a number of key initiatives to “streamline processes, increase agility and efficiencies, and improve operating performance,” including “improved contracting and sourcing, rationalizing discretionary spending, greater use of shared services and optimizing R&D efficiency,” measures that implicitly leverage integrated information and technology resources to align internal processes and strategic objectives. Research and development costs include “information systems’ costs and amortization of acquired technology used in R&D with alternative future uses,” reflecting the deployment of technology-enabled capabilities to support innovation and organizational goals. The Company also monitors “inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties” and analyzes prescription data for inventory management and chargeback estimations, demonstrating a capability to provide timely, accurate and reliable information in support of business decisions. The completion of facilities construction and entry into licensure for a “next-generation biomanufacturing facility in Singapore,” expected to increase manufacturing productivity versus conventional alternatives at lower capital costs and operating expense, exemplifies the strategic integration of advanced infrastructure and process automation for enhanced operational flexibility and competitive positioning. The restructuring plan announced in December 2014 to reduce staff and facilities footprint by the end of 2015 enables reallocation of resources to invest in innovation and new pipeline molecules, underscoring the firm’s competence in combining and reconfiguring assets and technology-based resources in support of business transformation and performance improvement.

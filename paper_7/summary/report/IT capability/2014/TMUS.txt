T-Mobile’s disclosures reflect a significant expansion and modernization of its digital infrastructure and underlying information technology capabilities, including the substantial network modernization due to the build-out of the LTE network—increasing coverage from more than 200 million people at December 31, 2013 to 265 million as of December 31, 2014 and targeting 300 million by the end of 2015—and the process of building out its network to utilize recently acquired 700 MHz A-block, AWS and PCS spectrum licenses, with cash capital expenditures for property and equipment of $4.3 billion in 2014 and expected to be $4.4 billion to $4.7 billion in 2015. In parallel, the company has decommissioned the MetroPCS CDMA network and certain other redundant cell sites, deployed new devices and services under its “un-carrier” proposition to eliminate customer pain points and bring innovation to the industry, and launched successive phases that leverage technology-based resources—Phase 7.0 for nationwide Wi-Fi calling and texting on capable smartphones and a partnership with Gogo for unlimited in-flight messaging, and Phase 8.0 “Data Stash” enabling automatic rollover of high-speed data with tailored usage options—to enhance connectivity, operational flexibility and consumer choice. T-Mobile also utilizes equipment installment plans and a two-year factoring arrangement with a $640 million funding limit to finance device deployments and extend financial and technical resources, while employing performance measures such as ARPA, ARPU, churn metrics and adjusted EBITDA—each underpinned by data management, information reliability and analytics—to monitor network quality, support churn reduction initiatives, align technology deployment with strategic growth, and mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with other organizational assets to further customer-centric business strategies and drive competitive advantage.

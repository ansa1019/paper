In our digital media and digital marketing segments, we continue to mobilize and deploy IT‐based resources in combination with other organizational assets to deliver recurring, subscription‐based SaaS offerings including Creative Cloud and Adobe Marketing Cloud, integrating acquired technology platforms such as Neolane and Behance; we invest in our network and data center infrastructure—including computer equipment, hosting and server capacity—to support increased transaction volumes and enable cloud storage, file synchronization across user machines, cross‐channel campaign management and community‐based services, while employing dedicated personnel in implementation, account management and technical support to tailor information delivery, connectivity and access in response to changing business needs. We recognize subscription and hosted service revenue ratably over contract terms, applying multiple‐element revenue recognition frameworks that determine deliverable functionality, allocate fair value using vendor‐specific objective evidence or best‐estimated selling prices and leverage residual methods, reflecting our information management capability to provide data and information with appropriate accuracy, timeliness, reliability and security. Our research and development investments, including recruiting software developers and amortizing purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements, underscore our competence to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources in support of business strategies, facilitate process optimization and drive business transformation that underpins our firm’s competitive advantage.

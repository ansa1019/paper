ADP seeks to embrace new technology and innovation to deliver market-leading products and services that meet the needs of its clients across all of its markets, and its business strategy is predicated on the ability to drive innovation and service excellence and to attract, build and retain the right talent to position ADP as the global market leader in human capital management services.  In furtherance of these objectives, the company’s strategic pillars include growing its integrated suite of cloud-based HCM, benefits and payroll solutions to serve the U.S. market; investing to grow and scale HR business process outsourcing solutions by leveraging its platforms and processes; and leveraging its global presence to offer clients HCM, benefits and payroll solutions where they do business.  During fiscal 2014, systems development and programming costs increased by $63.7 million, or 10 percent, due to increased costs to develop, support and maintain its products, partially offset by a higher proportion of capitalized costs of its strategic projects, and capital expenditures of $218.7 million related to the data center and other facility improvements made to support its operations, with expected capital expenditures of $250 million to $275 million in fiscal 2015.  In the forward-looking risk factors, ADP identifies changes in technology and availability of skilled technical associates as among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially, underscoring the importance of evolving technology resources, management capability and operational flexibility in supporting ADP’s business process focus, competitive positioning and growth objectives.

Berkshire Hathaway’s discussion does not explicitly address information technology capabilities, but its unusually decentralized management structure—characterized by the absence of centralized or integrated business functions such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources and minimal headquarters involvement in day-to-day activities—implies that each operating unit maintains its own processes, data flows and reporting systems. The reliance on subsidiary-level financial and operational data for management’s discussion and analysis, segment disclosures and capital allocation decisions suggests an implicit network of information management processes that must provide accurate, timely and reliable metrics to corporate governance, permitting senior management to monitor underwriting, investment, operating and strategic performance across insurance, railroad, utilities and energy, manufacturing, service and retailing, and finance businesses. This distributed approach to resource coordination and reporting underpins the firm’s ability to mobilize and leverage diverse assets and capabilities in support of organizational goals, risk management and capital deployment despite the absence of a formal, centralized IT architecture.

In fiscal 2015, Starbucks expects to fund its core growth initiatives through targeted capital expenditures that include systems and technology investments in its stores and support infrastructure, reflecting its focus on enhancing technology-enabled processes and organizational support systems. The Company actively manages its cash and investments, which primarily consist of highly liquid available-for-sale securities, to internally fund operating needs, service borrowings and return capital to shareholders, guided by a formal market price risk management policy that limits speculative activity and prescribes the use of derivative instruments to hedge commodity, foreign-exchange and interest-rate exposures. Starbucks’ financing flexibility is further supported by an unsecured, revolving credit facility and a backstopped commercial paper program, both of which bear variable market-based interest rates and require compliance with covenants designed to safeguard credit quality. Enforceable purchase obligations, notably green coffee commitments that comprise 90% of such obligations, together with substantial operating lease commitments, demonstrate Starbucks’ structured approach to coordinating its physical and financial resources. Collectively, these practices illustrate the Company’s capability to deploy, coordinate and reconfigure both technological and financial resources in support of its business strategies and operational resilience.

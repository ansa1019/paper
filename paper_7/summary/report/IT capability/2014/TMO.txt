The company expands its offerings “by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses,” such as the integration of Life Technologies into its Life Sciences Solutions segment, thereby coordinating assets, internal processes and interfirm relationships to drive innovation and competitive advantage.  It reports productivity improvements “from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing,” reflecting its ability to mobilize and deploy resources and process‐management practices to support business strategies.  Its accounting policies for software and technology‐based offerings note that “software license agreements generally include multiple products and services, or ‘elements,’” that revenue is recognized “based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor‐specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for any undelivered elements,” that maintenance and support revenues are “recognized on a straight‐line basis over the term of the contract” with VSOE determined by standalone pricing, and that training and consulting service revenues are “recognized as services are performed,” all of which imply capabilities in information management, system integration and tailored user access.  In valuing acquisition-related intangible assets—which encompass technology‐based rights, processes and knowledge—the company employs significant judgment “with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non‐amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized,” and it “estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses,” discounted to present value.  It reviews both definite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment upon “indication of potential impairment” such as “a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets,” unexpected economic or technological changes, competitive activities or regulatory actions.  Such processes underscore the firm’s competence in deploying IT-based resources in combination with organizational capabilities and its focus on information timeliness, reliability, security and adaptability to changing business needs and strategic directions.

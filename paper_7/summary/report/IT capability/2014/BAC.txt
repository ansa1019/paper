Bank of America’s consumer banking franchise is supported by a comprehensive omni‐channel platform that includes 4,800 banking centers and 15,800 ATMs, nationwide call centers, leading online and mobile banking platforms and associated data processing and telecommunications infrastructure to serve approximately 48 million customer relationships.  Our risk management and operational frameworks employ robust IT‐enabled capabilities—ranging from statistical credit modeling based on credit bureau and internal behavioral data for underwriting, pricing and limit management to real-time cash flow forecasting, stress testing and value‐at-risk analytics across trading, mortgage and asset-liability portfolios—supported by data reconciliation processes, transaction processing and monitoring, fraud management units and cybersecurity controls and systems.  Mortgage banking valuation models leverage inputs such as prepayment speeds, discount rates and market spreads, with net servicing rights hedged by agency MBS, swaps and futures to mitigate interest rate exposure, while asset-liability management uses interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives to align the repricing characteristics of loans, deposits, securities and long-term debt under evolving Basel III liquidity and capital standards, including the LCR, NSFR and GSIB buffers.  Global Markets further refines its risk posture through daily backtesting of VAR and scenario stress tests, and credit portfolio management integrates master netting agreements, collateral analytics and credit default swaps to optimize funding, capital and IT-based risk monitoring capabilities throughout the organization.

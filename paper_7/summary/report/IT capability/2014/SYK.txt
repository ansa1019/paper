Stryker’s 2014 capital expenditures of $233 million were primarily directed toward supporting the integration of recent acquisitions, information technology infrastructure upgrades, capacity expansion, new product introductions, innovation and cost-savings initiatives, illustrating the firm’s commitment to enhancing its IT resources and digital backbone. In March 2014, the acquisition of Patient Safety Technologies, Inc., and its wholly owned SurgiCount Medical subsidiary—including the proprietary Safety-Sponge® system and SurgiCount 360™ compliance software—demonstrates the deployment of software-based solutions to bolster operational processes and clinical safety. Moreover, the July 2014 establishment of a European regional headquarters in the Netherlands, intended to strengthen the Stryker brand in Europe, support global business growth, provide operational efficiencies and simplify the customer experience, reflects a broader focus on coordinating assets, streamlining internal processes and reinforcing interfirm relationships through enhanced organizational capabilities.

Visa continues to invest in infrastructure, technology and network processing to support its global growth initiatives, with adjusted operating expenses in fiscal 2014 and 2013 reflecting continued investments in infrastructure, technology and network processing to support our global growth initiatives. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally and with Visa Europe, and are also earned for transactions processed by CyberSource’s online payment gateway platform. Network and processing expenses represent the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services, and in fiscal 2014 and 2013 increased mainly due to continued technology and processing network investments to support growth. Depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal 2014 and 2013, primarily due to additional depreciation from our ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. We provide our financial institution clients with a global payments infrastructure and support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products, and facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. Service revenues consist mainly of revenues earned for providing support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products and solutions, assessed based on current pricing applied to the prior quarter’s payments volume, while international transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities.

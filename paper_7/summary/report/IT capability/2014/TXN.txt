We invest more than $1 billion annually to develop new products for our portfolio, leveraging a broad range of analog and embedded processing semiconductors; our global sales force, larger than those of our competitors, and the breadth of our portfolio attract tens of millions of visits to our website each year where customers begin their initial product searches and design-in journey. Revenue recognition processes require coordination of title and risk of loss transfers, persuasive evidence of arrangement, fixed and determinable amounts and reasonably assured collectability, and rely on managementâ€™s estimates of future credits to be granted to customers or distributors under industry-common programs based on statistical analyses of historical data, current economic conditions and contractual terms. Approximately 60 percent of our distributor revenue is generated through consignment inventory arrangements at designated locations, with revenue recognized when product is pulled from consignment. We determine royalty revenue and the timing of recognition in accordance with contractual agreements with intellectual property licensees, and we maintain allowances for accounts receivable based on ongoing reviews of aging balances. Our capital investments include $385 million in 2014, primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and our software license obligations encompass electronic design automation tools, together reflecting our commitment to deploy and reconfigure technology resources in support of our business strategies and manufacturing processes. We also maintain information systems to manage inventory valuation reserves, tax provision estimates arising from temporary differences between tax and financial reporting, and support our liquidity with a $2 billion revolving credit facility that underpins our commercial paper program.

Although the 10-K focuses on drug discovery, development, manufacturing, commercialization and financial condition, it implicitly describes a coordinated information management and analytical infrastructure that acquires, deploys and reconfigures data and resources to support strategic and operational decision-making. The narrative details systematic monitoring of clinical trial results and nonclinical studies, frequent evaluation of development programs based on new scientific, business and commercial insights, tracking of payor mix data and government-mandated rebates, chargebacks and discounts, inventory levels in the distribution channel, and adjustments to estimates as new information becomes available. It further describes the use of probability-weighted present-value models to assess fair value of in-process research and development assets, allocation of consideration in collaborative arrangements based on best estimates of selling prices, and accrual of obligations to third-party service providers using contractual terms and performance data. The company also refers to compliance policies and systems designed to identify, prevent and mitigate risk globally and to dedicate substantial management and other resources to obtain and maintain reimbursement, all of which reflect institutional governance of information, transactions and technology-enabled processes that align organizational resources with evolving regulatory, clinical and commercial goals.

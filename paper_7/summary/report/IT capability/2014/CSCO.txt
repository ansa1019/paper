We design, manufacture, and sell Internet-Protocol-based networking products and services for the communications and information technology industry, connecting people, process, data and things with products that transport data, voice, and video within buildings, across campuses, and around the world, and acting as a key strategic partner to help companies make the most of the Internet of Everything and “connect the unconnected.”  Our strategy is to deliver integrated architectures, solutions, and outcomes to help our customers grow, manage costs, and mitigate risk by capitalizing on market transitions, with the network as a foundational technology.  We see our customers in almost every industry becoming increasingly reliant on technology—and specifically the network—to meet their business objectives and compete successfully in the market.  We are focused on driving the innovation, speed, agility, and efficiencies required to deliver leading technology solutions for our customers and value for our shareholders.  Over the last few years, we have been working to transform our business from selling individual products and services to offering integrated architectures and solutions aligned with customers’ business outcomes, and as part of this transformation we are changing how we are organized and how we deliver technology to better meet customer requirements and stay ahead of market transitions.  In parallel, we continue to invest in growth areas such as data center, software, security, and cloud, while managing costs and driving efficiencies across our operations.

As a leading global provider of financial services technology, we provide account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, internet and mobile banking software and services necessary for our clients’ non-discretionary operations, generating recurring, transaction-based fees under multi-year contracts. We continue to implement strategic initiatives to deliver integrated technology and services solutions that enable best-in-class results, enhance operational effectiveness, reinforce client relationships and differentiate our offerings through innovation and integration. The acquisition of Open Solutions Inc. advanced our go-to-market strategies by adding DNA, a real-time, open-architecture account processing system, thereby expanding our technology portfolio and the breadth of our add-on solutions. Industry trends toward digital channels—including internet, mobile and tablet banking—and the growing volume and types of payment transactions have increased data and transaction processing needs, prompting financial institutions to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information and offer innovative new services. We anticipate long-term benefits from the trend of clients moving from in-house technology to outsourced solutions, leveraging our economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks necessary to remain competitive. Operational efficiency and scale efficiencies initiatives have lowered our cost structure, while capital expenditures—approximately 6% and 5% of revenue in 2014 and 2013—reflect ongoing investment in infrastructure and software development to support our information management capabilities and maintain connectivity, security and reliability in response to evolving business needs.

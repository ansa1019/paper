Streaming delivery expenses and technology and development investments underscore our evolving IT capability to coordinate digital assets, organizational processes and interfirm relationships, as we deploy both proprietary and third-party content delivery networks (“Open Connect”) and related equipment to efficiently stream high volumes of content to members over the internet. Streaming content rights are capitalized as an intangible library when license periods commence and amortized over the shorter of each title’s contractual availability or expected viewing patterns, reflecting our competence in managing digital resources and tailoring information delivery to business needs. Technology and development expenses, which represented 9 percent of revenues in each of the last two years, consist of payroll and related costs for testing, maintaining and modifying our user interface, recommendation and merchandising engines, streaming delivery technology and telecommunications systems and infrastructures as well as costs for computer hardware and software. Growth in these expenses—driven by a 12 percent headcount increase in 2014 and an 8 percent increase in 2013—supports continued improvements to our streaming service and international expansion, demonstrating the firm’s ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources in support of our business strategy.

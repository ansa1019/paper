Management has noted that it has continued to undertake multiple technology-focused initiatives to enhance its operational flexibility, efficiency and network capacity, most notably through the continued deployment of technology improvements (including several facility automation projects and the accelerated deployment of its on-road integrated optimization and navigation system, “Orion”), which should increase network capacity and improve operational efficiency, flexibility and reliability.  In addition, the company reports that it has adjusted its air and ground networks to better match volume levels, has utilized technology to increase package sorting and delivery efficiency, and has benefited from improved pickup and delivery densities, enabling it to process increased volume at a faster rate than the growth in aircraft block hours and vehicle miles driven.  These efforts reflect an ongoing focus on mobilizing and deploying technology-based resources in combination with physical assets and processes to support and enhance business strategies, work processes and network performance in response to changing customer needs and market dynamics.

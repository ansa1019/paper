During fiscal 2014, we continued to enhance our data systems for capturing and tracking the technical characteristics of our products, customer and end-customer information, and other data points used to categorize revenue by end market, and when these systems evolve and improve such that product categorization varies over time, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. In our distributor sales arrangements, where price-adjustment credits and return privileges preclude fixed or determinable sales prices, we defer revenue recognition until distributors resell products to end customers and record reserves for sales returns and allowances based on historical experience or specific identification of events necessitating a reserve. For multiple-element arrangements, we allocate arrangement consideration among deliverables based on vendor-specific objective evidence, third-party evidence or our best estimate of selling price. Revenue from government and certain commercial contracts is recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis using units delivered or costs incurred as a measure of progress. We value inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market and write down inventories to net realizable value using a variety of methodologies that reflect demand forecasts and aging, while maintaining allowances for doubtful accounts based on historical customer payment performance. We recognize acquired intangible assets, including in-process research and development, at estimated fair values and amortize them on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, perform annual impairment reviews of finite-lived intangible assets and indefinite-lived goodwill using discounted cash flow and other valuation methodologies that require significant judgment, and remeasure contingent consideration obligations at fair value each reporting period. Our cash and short-term investment management practices maintain highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less at acquisition, continually monitor credit exposure to counterparties, and diversify investments to minimize credit risk. We monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and to better align expenses with revenues, have undertaken restructuring actions to optimize our cost structure, and view a continued commitment to research and development, capital expenditures and process improvements as essential to maintain product leadership, support innovative new product offerings and drive future revenue growth.

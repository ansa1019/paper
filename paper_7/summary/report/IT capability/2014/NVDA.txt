NVIDIA’s management discussion and analysis describes a firmwide commitment to advancing visual computing and digital interactivity through a coherent platform strategy that integrates complex graphics architectures into both dedicated GPUs and system-on-a-chip Tegra processors combining multi-core CPUs, GPUs, audio, video and I/O capabilities, thereby mobilizing technology resources to support gaming, enterprise, high-performance computing, cloud, big-data analytics, automotive infotainment and safety systems. The Company’s business model—including NVIDIA-branded products, processor offerings to OEMs and IP licensing—is underpinned by ongoing engineering development investments, facilities and IT support expenses, and purchases of computer and software supplies to sustain its information systems capability. Recent technology deployments such as Maxwell- and Pascal-based GPU architectures with 3D memory and NVLink interconnects, the Tesla K80 dual-GPU accelerator for machine learning and data analytics, and NVIDIA GRID virtualization on VMware’s Horizon DaaS platform demonstrate strategic digital technology integration, connectivity enhancements, and operational flexibility. Inventory and receivables management processes rely on demand forecasting and allowances to maintain efficiency and information reliability, while non-cancelable software licensing arrangements under operating leases and a disciplined investment policy governing high-grade, diversified marketable securities reflect formal IT governance and strategic resource allocation. Capital expenditures of $150–$200 million planned for fiscal 2016—targeting facilities, emulation equipment, computers and engineering workstations—alongside convertible note financing, share repurchases and dividend programs further illustrate coordinated decisions to deploy financial and technology assets in support of long-term performance and competitive advantage.

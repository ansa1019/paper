Nike’s strategy to support and enhance its business processes and competitive positioning has increasingly relied on coordination of physical and digital resources, as evidenced by the expansion of its direct-to-consumer operations—including Nike-owned in-line and factory retail stores and Nike-owned internet websites—with online sales through Nike-owned websites growing 42% in fiscal 2014 to represent approximately 15% of Nike Brand DTC revenues, supported by new store openings and continued e-commerce business launches. The company seeks operational flexibility and cost efficiency by leveraging existing infrastructure across its portfolio of businesses to eliminate duplicative costs, making its supply chain a competitive advantage, and improving selling and administrative expense productivity through targeted investments that drive economic returns. Reflecting a firm capability to deploy and reconfigure resources, Nike has increased investments in its digital capabilities and corporate infrastructure—including enhanced digital infrastructure and marketing support for its digital business—while reinforcing deep personal consumer connections through high-impact marketing around global sporting events and digital marketing, and advancing product creation and design initiatives that integrate proprietary technology platforms to further organizational goals.

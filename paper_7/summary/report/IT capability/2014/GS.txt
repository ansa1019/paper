Our forward-looking statements expressly address the objectives and effectiveness of our information security program and business continuity plan.  We maintain an independent control infrastructure that leverages dedicated technology to support our fair-value measurement practices, whereby market makers and investment professionals perform daily pricing and our independent price verification function employs trade comparison, external price comparison using third-party data sources, calibration to market comparables, relative-value and collateral analyses, trade execution evidence, and back-testing.  Our independent model validation group—comprising quantitative professionals separate from model developers—conducts a rigorous approval process for each valuation and risk model, critically evaluating theoretical soundness, accuracy, calculation techniques, consistency across products and sensitivity to input parameters, and re-approves models annually before deployment.  We have made substantial investments in risk-management technology to enable independent calculation of value-at-risk and stress measures, position-level risk metrics, attribution of risk to individual factors, multi-dimensional reporting by desk, business, product type or legal entity, and rapid ad hoc analysis.  The firmwide technology risk committee reviews the design, development, deployment and use of technology, oversees cyber-security matters and technology risk-management frameworks, and monitors their effectiveness, and our communications and technology costs are tracked and governed under our operational and technology risk management policies.

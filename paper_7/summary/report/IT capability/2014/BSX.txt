We are seeking to expand our presence and strengthen relationships in order to grow net sales and market share within our emerging markets, and we have increased our investment in infrastructure in these countries in order to maximize opportunities. Through our acquisition of the electrophysiology business of C.R. Bard Inc., we obtained a strong commercial team and complementary portfolio of ablation catheters, diagnostic tools, and electrophysiology recording systems, and during the fourth quarter of 2012 we completed the acquisition of Rhythmia Medical, Inc., a developer of next-generation mapping and navigation solutions for use in cardiac catheter ablations and other electrophysiology procedures. Our core CRM technology represents know-how, patented and unpatented technology, testing methodologies and hardware that is integral to our current and future product generations, including battery and capacitor technology, lead technology, software algorithms and interfacing for shocking and pacing used in each therapy franchise. Ingenio™ MRI pacing leads are part of the ImageReady™ MR-conditional pacemaker system, which includes Vitalio™ MRI, Formio™ MRI, Advantio™ MRI and Ingenio™ MRI pulse generators, and when used with the Latitude™ NXT patient management system these devices wirelessly monitor patients for conditions such as atrial arrhythmias.

We describe our progressive evolution of digital infrastructure and resource deployment across web and mobile platforms, noting that the widespread adoption of mobile devices is driving substantial traffic and commerce to our mobile applications and web browsers and requiring us to rapidly innovate and create new, user-friendly and differentiated mobile offerings to maintain competitive positioning. We emphasize significant investments in our technology infrastructure, including outsourced data center capacity, additional hardware and software to support global operations, and ongoing expenditures for software licenses, system maintenance and data communications, in order to optimize service delivery and facilitate operational flexibility. We discuss our strategic use of digital marketing and distribution channels—search engine keyword purchases, meta-search and travel research referrals, affiliate programs, and internet and mobile advertisements—to generate branded traffic and tailor our offerings in response to shifting consumer behaviors. In particular, we highlight the integration of meta-search insights acquired through Kayak into our platform to enhance pricing and promotional strategies and improve the end-to-end customer experience. We note that our information technology expenses encompass payments for software development, system maintenance, data center hosting and outside consulting to support process automation, connectivity and information management capabilities. Our mobile offerings have received strong reviews and solid download trends, driving a growing share of our bookings, and we believe that continued enhancements in connectivity, application functionality and digital infrastructure are critical to sustaining resource allocation efficiency, strategic adaptability and market responsiveness in an environment where changes in internet search engine algorithms or traffic-generating arrangements can materially affect competitive positioning. Finally, we reaffirm our commitment to ongoing investments in technology and personnel to support long-term operating results, recognizing that such expenditures are necessary to broaden our digital platforms, expand into new markets and pursue strategic acquisitions.

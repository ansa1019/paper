The report does not explicitly discuss “IT capability” per se, but it does refer repeatedly to the systems and services that underlie Blackstone’s ability to gather, process and convey information in support of its business strategies and operations. For example, “communications and information services” are identified as a component of general and administrative expenses, and numerous references are made to the use of management information systems to calculate assets under management, fee-earning assets under management, net asset values, performance fees and realized and unrealized investment income, all of which imply underlying information technology resources that coordinate data and internal processes, support reporting and analytical functions, and enable the firm to mobilize and deploy its financial and human resources in a timely, reliable and scalable manner. Moreover, the firm’s detailed discussion of key operating metrics, fee structures, performance measurement and valuation processes presupposes robust data‐management capabilities, connectivity and secure access—elements of IT capability that facilitate decision-making, compliance, performance linkage and the coordination of interfirm transactions and relationships.

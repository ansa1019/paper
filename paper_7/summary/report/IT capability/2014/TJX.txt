During fiscal 2015, we continued to reinvest in our business by adding new stores, remodeling existing ones and strengthening our infrastructure to support our next level of growth, which included capital expenditures of $443.2 million for office and distribution centers (including buying and merchandising systems and information systems) and, for fiscal 2016, a planned spend of approximately $487 million for offices and distribution centers to support growth; in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 we launched our e-commerce site, tjmaxx.com, and in late fiscal 2013 we acquired Sierra Trading Post, a leading off-price internet retailer operating sierratradingpost.com, both of which reflect our expanding digital infrastructure and online retail capabilities; general corporate expense trends in fiscal 2014 and 2015 were influenced by increases in systems and technology costs and investments in talent and research, and during fiscal 2015 we also entered into a lease agreement for a new home office facility in Canada, resulting in construction-in-progress assets and related long-term liabilities that encompass the build-out of our next generation of information systems and related IT infrastructure.

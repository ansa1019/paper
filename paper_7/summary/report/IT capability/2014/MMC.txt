The company’s MD&A discloses that consolidated operating expenses increased “primarily reflects higher incentive compensation, facilities and software amortization costs, partly offset by lower pension costs,” underscoring the material impact of software asset amortization. It further identifies “corporate initiatives, which include strengthening cyber security protections, expenses related to strategic investments and corporate transformation efforts, primarily within the HR and finance functions,” pointing to investments in information security and system enhancements. The firm also reports that its “additions to fixed assets and capitalized software, which amounted to $368 million in 2014 and $401 million in 2013, primarily relate to computer equipment purchases, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs,” reflecting ongoing IT infrastructure deployment and application development. In describing its service platform, the company states that it provides “analysis, advice and transactional capabilities to clients in more than 130 countries,” which implies the coordination of digital technologies and transactional systems to support global operations and interfirm relationships.

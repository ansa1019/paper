During 2014, as part of our strategy to transform our business to attain approximately 50% of our revenue from high-growth adjacent markets by the end of 2015, we focused on introducing a more diverse product portfolio, announced our ambidextrous computing roadmap to develop custom high-performance ARM and x86 processor cores for 2016 and publicly demonstrated the AMD Opteron™ A1100 series, and continued to experience strong demand for our semi-custom SoCs in game consoles while launching new embedded, notebook APU and graphics products. In connection with the formation of GlobalFoundries, we entered into a Wafer Supply Agreement requiring us to purchase all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements from GF, subject to specified transition provisions under which GF will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist in transitioning supply to another provider, reflecting coordination of our manufacturing assets and interfirm relationships. Our preparation of consolidated financial statements requires critical accounting estimates, including those related to revenue, inventory valuation, goodwill impairment and income taxes, which we evaluate on an ongoing basis, base on historical experience and assumptions, assess inventory obsolescence by comparing forecasted demand and market conditions to on-hand quantities and apply income-based valuation models to determine fair values—underscoring our information management capability to provide accurate, timely and reliable data for management’s judgments. Management reviews segment net revenue and operating income before interest and taxes, allocates expenses to our computing and graphics and enterprise, embedded and semi-custom segments based on management’s judgment, and realigned our organizational structure effective July 1, 2014 to support strategic goals. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we implemented a restructuring plan to improve operating efficiencies by reducing global headcount, aligning our real estate footprint and recording related severance, contract termination, facility and asset impairment charges. We maintain a secured revolving line of credit, collateralized by accounts receivable and inventory, enabling borrowings up to 85% of eligible receivables to fund general corporate purposes and enhance operational flexibility, and remained in compliance with its covenants as of December 27, 2014.

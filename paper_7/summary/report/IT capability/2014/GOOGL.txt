The discussion highlights that the ongoing shift from an offline to an online, multi‐screen environment—driven by growing mobile computing power, device connectivity, and users’ demand for seamless access—has required us to coordinate and reconfigure our information technology resources to support business strategies and work processes. We note that as users in developing economies come online and access our offerings via multiple devices, we continue to develop localized versions of our products and advertising programs, reflecting the deployment of IT capability across geographies. To maintain and grow our business in this evolving digital economy, we invest heavily in systems, data centers, real estate, facilities, and information technology infrastructure as well as significant research and development in strategic areas such as search, advertising, and new products and services. Acquisitions further enhance our engineering expertise and technology portfolio. Cost of revenues disclosures include data-center operations and content acquisition costs; research and development expenses detail labor, facilities, depreciation, and equipment costs for product and service innovation; and general and administrative expenses cover personnel and outsourcing costs in finance, human resources, information technology, legal organizations, and professional fees for IT consulting. These disclosures underscore our ability to mobilize IT-based resources—encompassing infrastructure, data management, localized digital platforms, IT governance, and engineering competencies—to drive business agility, innovation, and the coordination of internal processes and interfirm relationships.

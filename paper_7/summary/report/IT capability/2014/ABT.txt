Abbottâ€™s capital expenditures include significant investments in information technology to upgrade and expand its global infrastructure and support laboratory instruments placed with customers, and management leverages both internal and third-party inventory management data in the domestic nutritional business to reliably estimate distribution channel inventories and related rebate reserves. Under the transition services agreements following the separation of AbbVie and the sale of its developed markets branded generics business, Abbott provides information technology and other back-office support services, with related billings recorded as service cost reductions in the applicable expense categories, and its selling, general and administrative expenses reflect charges associated with information technology costs transferred to AbbVie under these arrangements. To support its rebate and chargeback programs, the company regularly analyzes historical trends, adjusts reserves for changes in program terms and employs techniques to verify the accuracy of claims, illustrating its information management capability in providing accurate, timely, and actionable data for business processes and strategic decision-making.

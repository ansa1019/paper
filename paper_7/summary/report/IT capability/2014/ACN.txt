Clients have increasingly focused on initiatives to deliver cost savings, improve operational efficiency and integrate their global operations to grow and transform their businesses, and we have responded by deploying market-leading service offerings and skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. We continue to experience growing demand for our services in emerging technologies, including digital services (digital marketing, analytics and mobility) and cloud computing, and have increased the proportion of systems integration consulting and application outsourcing delivered through lower-cost resources in our global delivery network, a trend that has driven work volume growth faster than revenue and is expected to continue. Our contracts frequently consist of multiple elements—technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services and outsourcing services—with revenues allocated based on the lesser of each element’s relative selling price or non-contingent amount, and we recognize revenues from technology integration consulting using the percentage-of-completion method over contract terms of six months to two years, including estimated performance incentives deemed probable. Costs related to transition and set-up activities necessary to enable outsourced services are deferred and amortized evenly over the period services are provided, with impairment losses recorded when projected undiscounted operating cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets, and time-and-materials and cost-plus outsourcing revenues are recognized as services are performed, with effort measured by time incurred. General and administrative costs primarily include information systems expenditures, reflecting ongoing investment in technology infrastructure. These practices underscore our capability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources in support of business strategies and work processes, mobilizing IT-based resources in combination with other assets and capabilities to enhance organizational performance and responsiveness to changing business needs.

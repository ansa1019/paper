We emphasize throughout our Business Overview and segment discussions that our enterprise software and hardware products and related services are engineered to support and enhance customers’ information technology capabilities by delivering enterprise-grade, reliable, secure and interoperable solutions that offer customers a choice in deployment models—whether through our Oracle Cloud software-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service and infrastructure-as-a-service offerings or via customer-managed internal cloud or on-premise IT environments.  We develop and maintain our products on a standards-based, integrated architecture designed to help customers reduce the cost and complexity of their IT infrastructure, enable rapid deployment of critical business functions, and provide comprehensive virtualization, clustering and large-scale systems management functionality.  Our engineered systems combine hardware and software offerings to increase computing performance, create cost efficiencies, time savings and operational advantages, and we integrate, support and manage software and hardware on customers’ behalf to deliver scalable, managed IT environments.  We believe our continued investments in research and development and targeted acquisitions strengthen our ability to provide the IT functionality customers need—such as application and data management, connectivity, security, reliability and automated lifecycle management—to enable customers to evolve and transform their enterprise IT environments at the pace and scale best aligned with their business strategies.  In addition, our high-availability software license updates and product support contracts, hardware infrastructure management and maintenance services, and consulting engagements focused on enterprise architecture planning, system integration and optimization, all serve to sustain and extend customers’ IT capabilities, improve operational efficiency and support competitive advantage in dynamic market conditions.

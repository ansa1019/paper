Bristol-Myers Squibb’s research and development expenses include proportionate allocations of enterprise-wide costs such as facilities and information technology in support of discovery research, clinical development, late-stage regulatory programs and medical support of marketed products, demonstrating the integration of IT resources into core R&D processes. In connection with the SEC consent order, the company established a formal review and certification process for its annual and quarterly reports, created a business risk and disclosure group, and retained an outside consultant to comprehensively study and help re-engineer its accounting and financial reporting processes, reflecting a structured governance framework and process optimization often enabled by information management capabilities. Process standardization implementation costs of $9 million in 2014 and $16 million in 2013 were recognized within marketing, selling and administrative expenses, evidencing investments to streamline and digitally underpin standardized business processes. A company-wide policy supported by a governance process to escalate and resolve compliance questions, along with regular monitoring, further underscores the firm’s emphasis on accurate, timely and reliable information flows across organizational functions.

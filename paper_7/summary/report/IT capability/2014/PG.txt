Procter & Gamble’s MD&A emphasizes that the daily conduct of its business depends on its ability to maintain key information technology systems, including those operated by third-party suppliers, and to uphold security over its data; its global business services organization is specifically charged with providing technology, processes and standard data tools to global business units and sales and market operations to enhance business insight and consumer service while minimizing cost and capital investment; the company’s productivity and cost savings plan, which spans supply chain, research and development, marketing and overhead functions, is built on streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes—efforts that inherently draw on technology resources and process-redesign capabilities to deliver growth funding and cost reductions; and its treasury and risk management activities, including the use of derivative instruments to hedge interest rate, currency and commodity exposures, depend on robust technology infrastructure for valuation, sensitivity and value-at-risk analyses.

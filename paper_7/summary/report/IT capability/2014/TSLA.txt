Car sales include certain standard features and customer-selected options and configurations that meet the definition of a deliverable under multiple-element accounting guidance, including internet connectivity, supercharging access and specified software updates for cars equipped with autopilot hardware, each valued on a stand-alone basis and recognized over our performance period, generally the eight-year life of the car or, for software upgrades, as they are delivered. In October 2014, we revealed our all-wheel drive dual motor Model S and our autopilot system, reflecting the continued integration of advanced digital technologies into our vehicles. We allocate supercharger-related expenses to cost of revenues—automotive sales—and to selling, general and administrative expenses. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 included a $4.1 million increase in office, information technology and facilities-related costs, and selling, general and administrative expenses included a $135.9 million increase in office, information technology and facilities-related costs to support the growth of our business, global sales and marketing activities, and expansion of our customer support infrastructure.

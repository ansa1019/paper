Within the 2015 outlook, the company states that it “will continue using a multi-faceted approach to safety, utilizing technology, risk assessment, quality control, training and employee engagement, and targeted capital investments,” and its capital plan for 2015 “includes significant investments in technology improvements … including approximately $450 million for PTC,” while the operating expense disclosures specifically list “computer software” (together with telephone and cellular) as part of other expenses—all of which implicitly reflect the firm’s mobilization and deployment of technology resources and information systems to support safety, operational efficiency, regulatory compliance and evolving network requirements.

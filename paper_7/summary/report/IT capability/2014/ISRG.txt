The Company’s da Vinci surgical systems leverage “computational, robotic and imaging technologies to overcome many of the limitations of conventional MIS,” integrating a surgeon’s console, imaging electronics, a patient-side cart, and “computational hardware and software” that deliver an immersive three-dimensional high-definition visualization and natural instrument control, while its multi-port technology filters tremor and provides wrist-analogous motion. The system’s architecture has evolved with the da Vinci Xi to include “a new overhead instrument arm architecture designed to facilitate anatomical access from virtually any position,” “a new endoscope digital architecture that creates a simpler, more compact design with improved vision definition and clarity,” and “an ability to attach the endoscope to any arm, providing flexibility for visualizing the surgical site.” In designing its products, the Company “focus[es] on making our technology easy and safe to use,” and it has augmented its technology capabilities with training and collaboration platforms, including the da Vinci Connect remote case observation and mentoring tool, the da Vinci Skills Simulator, and the dual console for surgeon proctoring and collaborative surgery. The Company separately applied for and received regulatory clearances for technology-enabled extensions such as Firefly fluorescence imaging—which “combines a fluorescent dye with a specialized da Vinci camera head, endoscope and laser-based illuminator to allow surgeons to identify vasculature in three dimensions”—as well as vessel sealer and stapler instruments tailored for its digital platforms. To broaden its technology portfolio and support ongoing product innovation and organizational objectives, the Company “continue[s] to make strategic acquisitions of intellectual property and related technologies,” as exemplified by its 2014 acquisition of certain intellectual property, know-how and retained employees from Luna Innovations, Inc., and the reacquisition of distribution rights in Japan.

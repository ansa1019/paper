Our enterprise security platform, comprising a next-generation firewall, advanced endpoint protection, and a threat intelligence cloud, represents a core information systems capability that integrates proprietary hardware and software architecture to deliver application visibility and control (App-ID), user identification (User-ID), site-to-site VPN, remote access SSL VPN, and quality-of-service, while enabling central management across physical and virtualized environments and hybrid SaaS subscription delivery to meet evolving enterprise security requirements. We leverage this platform to provide real-time threat prevention, URL filtering, malware detection, and mobile device management through our GlobalProtect appliance, thereby enhancing connectivity, security, operational efficiency, and process automation for fixed and mobile endpoints in both public and private cloud settings. Management emphasizes that our ability to extend technology leadership, grow and deepen deployment of our platform and services within the installed base, extend service term lengths, and focus on end-customer satisfaction is critical to sustaining competitive advantage amid dynamic market and competitive forces. To support these strategies and manage future growth effectively, we continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our capacity to efficiently manage headcount, capital, and processes. Our commitment to enhancing IT capabilities is reflected in planned investments—approximately $25.0 million in research and development, customer support, and advanced endpoint protection sales force expansion for fiscal 2015—and in strategic acquisitions such as Cyvera’s endpoint software technology and Morta Security’s cybersecurity team, which bolster our IT resources, management skills, and technology competencies to enable rapid identification, analysis, and elimination of cyber threats. General and administrative expense further includes costs associated with our IT organization and information systems, underscoring the firm’s ongoing investment in technology infrastructure, data management, and information systems capability to support business processes, strategic decision-making, and organizational goals.

The company states that it “designs, manufactures and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers and portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, accessories, networking solutions and third-party digital content and applications,” underscoring its integrated hardware-software-networking strategy. It highlights the introduction and deployment of key platform software—announcing iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite at its 2014 Worldwide Developer Conference, releasing iOS 8, launching Apple Pay and previewing Apple Watch—to reflect ongoing enhancements to its digital infrastructure. In its revenue recognition policies, the company allocates revenue among hardware, essential bundled software, unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services based on vendor-specific objective evidence, third-party evidence of selling price or the company’s best estimate of selling price, with deferrals amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated support periods of two to four years, demonstrating its focus on accurate information management and service delivery. The company records adjustments to revenue for price protection, customer incentive programs and anticipated product returns in accordance with historical experience, and provides warranty cost accruals based on historical and projected claim rates, illustrating its management of operational risks associated with its product and service offerings. It emphasizes that focused investments in research and development are “critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products,” and anticipates approximately $12.4 billion in 2015 capital expenditures for product tooling, manufacturing process equipment, data centers and “corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and enhancements,” reflecting a sustained commitment to strengthening its IT infrastructure, operational flexibility and capability to support evolving business strategies.

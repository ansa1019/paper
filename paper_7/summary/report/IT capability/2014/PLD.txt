The company’s discussion underscores the coordinated deployment of its operating platform, balance sheet strength and team skills as unique competitive advantages that support the expansion of revenue-generating assets with minimal incremental administrative expense, reflecting optimized infrastructure and resource allocation capabilities. In managing its owned and managed portfolio on an integrated basis regardless of ownership structure, the firm demonstrates consistent decision‐making processes and operational flexibility across internal and co-investment ventures. The adoption of a new accounting standard and the execution of comprehensive same-store analyses—eliminating portfolio composition changes and currency effects—reflect sophisticated information management and data processing capabilities. The capitalization of costs related to internally developed software, alongside the allocation of general and administrative expenses to development and leasing activities, illustrates the firm’s competence in acquiring, deploying and reconfiguring IT resources in support of strategic business processes. Complex derivative and hedging strategies to mitigate foreign currency and interest-rate exposures further highlight its systems capability for financial activities and connectivity with external markets. Together, these practices evidence the firm’s capacity to mobilize IT-based resources in combination with other assets, enhancing business process understanding, strategic decision-making, operational efficiency and interfirm transaction coordination.

Comcast’s cable communications segment describes a broad program of IT-based investments and deployments to coordinate and enhance its network assets, services and customer-facing processes. Residential video customers can use the Xfinity online portal and mobile apps to view live programming and on-demand content, browse program listings and manage DVR recordings, while high-speed internet offerings include an Xfinity portal and apps for email, contacts, calendars and security features. The company is actively deploying wireless gateways—combining wireless router, cable modem and voice adapter—to boost in-home Wi-Fi performance and create seamless connectivity for multiple devices, and it has grown its outdoor, business and in-home Wi-Fi hotspot network to 8.3 million access points. Business services leverage interactive online document-sharing tools, cloud-hosted voice servers and Ethernet network solutions to connect multiple locations, support multi-line voice and provide cellular backhaul to mobile operators for bandwidth management. Capital expenditures rose 13.9 percent to $6.2 billion, driven by continued investment in the IP and cloud-enabled X1 video platform and cloud DVR technology (now in over half of its markets), wireless gateway rollouts, network infrastructure capacity upgrades, expansion of small and medium-size business offerings, and the introduction of home security and automation services. These initiatives illustrate Comcast’s ongoing efforts to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure technology resources—spanning hardware, software, connectivity and service platforms—to support business strategies, enhance operational efficiency, improve customer access and maintain competitive advantage through digital innovation.

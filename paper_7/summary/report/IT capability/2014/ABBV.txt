AbbVie continues to incur incremental information technology‐related costs to operate as an independent company, including the build‐out of a stand-alone back-office infrastructure both domestically and abroad, and under its transition services agreements with Abbott receives corporate support services—among them information technology, accounts payable, payroll and other financial functions—as well as order entry, warehousing and administrative services in international markets until regulatory transfers are complete; in parallel, AbbVie leverages what it describes as reliable systems and calculations to track sales by product and customer or payer, estimate contractual or statutory rebates and processing lags, monitor economic and credit conditions, confirm receivable validity, establish probabilistic allowances, and support its rebate, chargeback and revenue recognition processes, all of which enable the coordination of its assets, internal processes and intercompany transactions in alignment with its financial reporting, operational efficiency and strategic objectives.

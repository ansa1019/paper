ServiceNow is described as a leading provider of cloud-based solutions that define, structure, manage and automate services across the global enterprise by applying a service-oriented lens to the activities, tasks and processes that comprise day-to-day work life so that the modern enterprise can operate faster and be more scalable. We continue to invest in the development of our services and infrastructure, including expansion of data centers and cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment, which is reflected in cost of subscription revenues primarily comprised of expenses related to hosting our services and providing support to our customersâ€”data center capacity costs, depreciation of cloud-based infrastructure hardware, amortization of acquired developed technology intangibles and personnel costs directly associated with our cloud-based infrastructure and customer support. Subscription revenues, which include access to multiple instances, hosting and support services, data backup and disaster recovery services and future upgrades, are recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract, when the services become available to the customer, with amounts billed in advance recorded in deferred revenue. Overhead costs associated with office facilities, IT and certain depreciation related to non-cloud-based infrastructure are allocated to cost of revenues and operating expenses based on headcount, and facility costs associated with our data centers are classified as cost of subscription revenues. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees for implementation, configuration and training and are primarily on a time-and-materials basis, with revenues recognized as the services are delivered using a proportional performance model. Deferred commissions, consisting of sales commissions and referral fees directly associated with customer contracts, are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable terms of those contracts, consistent with the timing of subscription revenue recognition. We expect our cost of subscription revenues to increase in absolute dollar terms as we serve more customers and grow user counts, but at a slower rate than subscription revenue, driving a slight increase in our gross profit percentage as we leverage investments in our data center infrastructure, while future acquisitions may increase costs related to the amortization of intangible assets. Research and development expenses are directed toward improving existing functionality of our services, developing new applications to fill market needs and enhancing our core platform. Capital expenditures for cloud-based infrastructure hardware, leasehold improvements and equipment support our growing headcount and ability to scale subscription and professional services. In our contractual obligations, operating leases for data centers represent principal commitments for co-location facilities, reflecting our focus on scalable, reliable infrastructure capability. Finally, in accounting for multiple-element arrangements we determine the selling price of each deliverable using a hierarchy of vendor-specific objective evidence, third-party evidence or best estimate of selling price and allocate the total arrangement fee to subscription and professional services accordingly, deferring all revenue and related costs until delivery in certain on-premise deployment arrangements and recognizing deferred revenue as performance obligations are satisfied.

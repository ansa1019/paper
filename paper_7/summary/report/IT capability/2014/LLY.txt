Although the report contains no explicit references to information technology capabilities, it describes various processes that imply underlying information systems, including the regular review of supply levels by analyzing periodic inventory reports from wholesalers and prescription volume data, the establishment of reserves for returns, rebates, and discounts based on analyses of historical payment trends and contract provisions, the use of actuarial projections and forward yield curves in pension and retiree health benefit discount rate and asset return assumptions, and the employment of derivative contract valuations and sensitivity analyses for interest rate and foreign currency risk management, all of which collectively support coordinated resource deployment, data-driven decision making, and process optimization across the firmâ€™s global operations.

The MD&A describes structured processes for forecasting average selling prices, sales volumes and manufacturing costs, evaluating liquidity sources and capital spending plans and commitments to purchase property, plant and equipment, all of which rely on consolidated operational and financial data and require timely, accurate and reliable information management to support strategic resource allocation and operational flexibility. In accounting for acquisitions, management applied judgment to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities by projecting future cash flows, selecting appropriate discount rates and identifying comparable market values, activities that depend on robust information systems to provide the data aggregation and analysis needed for decision-making. The discussion of liquidity and capital resources further highlights continuous evaluation of financing alternatives, debt restructuring transactions and credit risk mitigation, underscoring the firm’s ability to mobilize and deploy information-based resources across its global operations. In the critical accounting estimates section, management’s assessment of lower-of-cost-or-market inventory write-downs, deferred tax asset realizability and impairment testing of property, plant and equipment similarly reflects the importance of integrated data management and forecasting capabilities in supporting the company’s judgments and controls.

The company discloses that it continues to incur increased central operating costs “primarily due to continued investment in modernizing our information systems,” which is reflected in higher selling, general and administrative expenses and is also identified as a component of its capital expenditure plans alongside warehouse expansion; its membership-fee revenue is “accounted for on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one-year membership period,” and its executive members’ 2% reward program is “accounted for as a reduction in sales” with the associated liability “computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non-redemptions based on historical data,” all of which imply significant information management capability; online sales from websites operating for more than one year are expressly included in “comparable warehouse sales” calculations, indicating reliance on e-commerce systems; cash and cash equivalents include “debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the last week of our fiscal year,” underscoring the role of payment-processing and data reconciliation systems; the company’s “foreign-currency transaction gains, net,” which arise from “the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and monetary liabilities” and “mark-to-market adjustments related to foreign exchange contracts,” point to complex systems for currency translation and risk management; and its disclosure of bank credit facilities, letters of credit, commercial paper programs and related borrowing capacity reflects the use of treasury management and credit-management systems in support of its broader business strategies.

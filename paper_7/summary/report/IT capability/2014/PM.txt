Although the report does not explicitly describe information technology capabilities, the Company’s detailed segment reporting, global management of net revenues, manufacturing costs, marketing and research expenses, currency translation and forecasting for diluted EPS, asset impairment analysis and tax rate calculations implicitly reflect the deployment of integrated information management systems and IT infrastructure to collect, consolidate and analyze data with the appropriate levels of timeliness, accuracy and security across multiple geographies and functions. The coordination of four operating segments, execution of share repurchase programs and preparation of forward-looking diluted EPS guidance further imply the use of IT resources to support strategic decision-making, resource allocation, intercompany transactions and compliance processes. These activities exemplify the mobilization of technology, data and management skills in service of the Company’s operational efficiency, performance monitoring and business strategy alignment.

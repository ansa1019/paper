During fiscal year 2014 and in our outlook for 2015, we continued to transform from a single‐channel, home improvement retailer to an omni‐channel home improvement company—selling products in stores, online, on-site and through contact centers and fulfilling orders in the most convenient manner for our customers—and we will continue to invest in omni-channel capabilities to ensure that we are convenient and easy to do business with; in support of this strategy, we have been working to relaunch LowesforPros.com, a dedicated platform enabling pro customers to transact online and to develop requisition lists, access purchase history and customized product catalogs; we believe that net cash provided by operating and financing activities will be adequate not only for our operating requirements but also for investments in information technology, and our fiscal 2015 capital forecast of approximately $1.4 billion—resulting in a planned net cash outflow of $1.2 billion—allocates roughly 30 percent of planned net cash outflow to corporate programs, including enhancements to the customer experience and corporate infrastructure; furthermore, our contractual purchase obligations of $847 million include commitments for marketing and information technology programs.

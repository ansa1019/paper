The company conducts business through two segments: risk and insurance services and consulting, which includes health, wealth, and career solutions. The company’s operations are impacted by restructuring activities focused on workforce actions, technology rationalization, and reductions in real estate. In 2022, the company incurred $427 million of restructuring costs, primarily related to these activities, which included rationalization of technology and functional services. The company’s subsidiaries, including Marsh and Guy Carpenter, engage in risk management, insurance broking, and analytical modeling, which are supported by technology-driven solutions that help organizations redefine the future of work. The consulting segment, through Mercer and Oliver Wyman, provides advice and technology-driven solutions that advance health and well-being for a changing workforce. The company completed 20 acquisitions in 2022, which are integral to enhancing its capabilities in risk and insurance services and consulting. The results of operations in both segments reflect the continued strong demand for advice and services, driven by the expansion of the global economy and investments in talent. The increase in operating expenses is primarily due to increased headcount and higher incentive compensation, as well as severance and lease exit charges, which are indicative of the company’s focus on operational efficiency and capability enhancement. The company’s technology capabilities are further developed through investments in software and technology infrastructure, which are essential for supporting business needs and enhancing operational flexibility. The company also monitors the impact of foreign exchange movements on its operations, which can affect revenue and expenses across its global operations. The consulting segment's revenue is influenced by global economic conditions and competitive actions, highlighting the importance of strategic resource allocation and market responsiveness. The company’s focus on technology deployment and innovation partnerships is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and addressing evolving market dynamics. The company’s management practices emphasize the mobilization and deployment of IT-based resources, which are critical for achieving organizational goals and enhancing firm performance. The ongoing restructuring and technology rationalization efforts are expected to yield estimated savings, reflecting the company’s commitment to optimizing its operational capabilities and improving performance outcomes. The company’s ability to leverage its IT capabilities in combination with other resources is fundamental to its strategy for driving business transformation and value creation in a competitive landscape.

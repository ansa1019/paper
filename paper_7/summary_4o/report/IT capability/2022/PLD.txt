In 2022, our operating results were robust, driven by strong demand and low vacancy in the global logistics markets, which resulted in significant rent changes and same-store growth in our operating portfolio. We believe we are well-positioned to organically grow revenues given the increase in market rents over the last several years and our high lease mark-to-market. However, we will be cautious as we manage our business in this uncertain environment, particularly in light of ongoing inflation and rising interest rates. Our financial condition and results of operations are influenced by our strategic capital segment, which includes revenues from asset management and property management services, as well as transactional services for acquisition, disposition, and leasing activity. The revenues associated with this segment fluctuate due to changes in the size of the portfolios through acquisitions and dispositions, as well as the fair value of the properties. We have a focus on build-to-suit developments and are pausing contributions into our open-ended funds in the near term, reflecting a disciplined approach to capital deployment activities. Our total available liquidity at year-end was $4.1 billion, which includes aggregate availability under our credit facilities and unrestricted cash balances. The completion of the Duke transaction for $23.2 billion, primarily comprised of logistics real estate assets, has positioned us to leverage our IT capabilities effectively in managing our operational efficiency and enhancing our business strategies. Our IT governance and management capabilities are critical in mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources, which are essential for supporting our business needs and enhancing our competitive advantage. The integration of technology resources into our operational processes allows us to respond to market dynamics and consumer demands effectively. We continually evaluate our investment decisions and resource allocation to ensure alignment with our organizational goals and market-based performance. Our strategic management practices are designed to enhance our operational flexibility and improve our performance metrics, thereby contributing to our overall organizational effectiveness. Additionally, our commitment to innovation and process optimization is evident in our capital expenditures aimed at modernizing our operating portfolio, including investments in sustainable building features. The strategic alignment of our technology infrastructure with our business processes is fundamental to achieving our performance outcomes and maintaining our competitive positioning in the market. As we navigate the challenges posed by the current economic environment, our focus on IT capability and resource integration will remain pivotal in driving our business transformation and enhancing our firm performance.

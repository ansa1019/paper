In 2022, we continued to invest in our data center capacity, servers, network infrastructure, and headcount, which are critical to our IT capabilities and operational efficiency. Our investments in technical infrastructure are part of our strategy to support our family of apps and enhance our advertising services. The increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure reflects our commitment to developing our IT architecture and capabilities. We are also making significant investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve our delivery, targeting, and measurement capabilities, which are essential for maintaining competitive advantage in the advertising market. Our advertising revenue has been adversely affected by reduced marketer spending due to limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating systems. To mitigate these challenges, we are evolving our advertising systems and developing privacy-enhancing technologies that will allow us to deliver relevant ads while reducing the amount of personal information processed. We are also working to innovate our advertising tools to help marketers prepare campaigns and connect with consumers, which underscores the importance of our IT capabilities in adapting to market dynamics. The restructuring measures we initiated in 2022, including a pivot towards a next-generation data center design, are aimed at enhancing our operational flexibility and efficiency. Our research and development expenses increased significantly, driven by higher payroll and related expenses in engineering and technical functions, indicating our focus on enhancing our IT capabilities to support business transformation and innovation. The increase in headcount, particularly in technical roles, reflects our strategic resource allocation to bolster our IT resources and capabilities. We expect that our investments in technology development across our reality labs segment will continue to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future, highlighting the long-term nature of our IT capability enhancement efforts. Our ability to support metaverse initiatives is contingent on generating sufficient profits from our other business areas, reinforcing the interconnectedness of our IT capabilities and overall business performance. The challenges posed by external influences, such as regulatory changes and competitive products, necessitate a robust IT governance framework to ensure alignment with our organizational goals and market responsiveness. Our ongoing evaluation of trends in advertising revenue and user engagement demonstrates the critical role of information management capability in adapting to shifting consumer demands and optimizing our business processes. The integration of advanced data analytics and information systems is fundamental to our strategy for improving operational efficiency and achieving performance excellence across our business segments.

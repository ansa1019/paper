We are a leading global provider of financial services technology, offering account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, internet and mobile banking systems, and related services. Our operations are comprised of the payments segment and the financial institution services segment, which provide essential services necessary for our clients to operate their businesses. The market for products and services offered by financial institutions continues to evolve rapidly, with traditional institutions and new entrants regularly introducing and implementing innovative payment, deposit, lending, investment, and risk management products. This evolution has increased the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions, leading to significant investments in technology to manage information, maintain regulatory compliance, and offer new services. We anticipate that financial institutions will continue to invest in outsourced solutions to remain current on technology changes, which we expect will create revenue opportunities for us. Our strategic initiatives include enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships and improving operational effectiveness through integrated technology and services solutions. We believe that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with our position as a leading provider of non-discretionary, recurring revenue-based products and services, provides a solid foundation for growth. Our enterprise priorities include continuing to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings goals, enhancing client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions, and delivering innovation and integration that enables differentiated value for our clients. The integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition, allowing us to assist financial institutions with regulatory and market challenges by providing new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce costs. We frequently review our portfolio to ensure alignment with our market, product, and financial strategies, expecting to acquire businesses that meet client demand and change industry dynamics. Our recent acquisitions, including online banking solutions and mortgage software, enhance our existing solutions and enable our clients to better serve their customers. The financial institutions marketplace has experienced changes in composition, with a steady decline in the number of institutions primarily due to voluntary mergers and acquisitions. These consolidations can impact our financial results through early contract termination fees but also provide opportunities when newly combined institutions choose to process on our systems. Our revenue is diversified, and our focus on long-term client relationships has mitigated the impact of industry consolidation. We believe that the demand for products facilitating customer interaction with financial institutions will continue to increase, further driving our revenue growth. Our operational flexibility and commitment to innovation are essential as we navigate the challenges of a rapidly changing market environment, ensuring our technology capabilities remain aligned with evolving client needs and preferences.

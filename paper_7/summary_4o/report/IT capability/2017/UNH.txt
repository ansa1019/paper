UnitedHealth Group leverages core competencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data; information and intelligence; and clinical care delivery, management, and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system. The company emphasizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities.

The company engages physicians and consumers with information and helps them make clinically sound choices, aiming to achieve high-quality, affordable care. Delivery system and payment modernization are increasingly important as health plans and care providers work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality. The company rewards care providers for delivering improvements in quality and cost-efficiency, which is facilitated by leveraging data and analytics to provide necessary information to improve health outcomes. The trend toward value-based care is creating needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems. The company’s contracts with value-based elements total nearly $65 billion in annual spending, indicating significant investment in IT capabilities to support these initiatives. The organization’s ability to adapt to market dynamics and regulatory changes is critical for maintaining competitive advantage, as the commercial risk market remains highly competitive. The company continues to seek balance between growth and profitability while focusing on operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation.

The firm’s IT capabilities support its strategic management practices and facilitate the coordination of internal processes and external relationships, which are vital for responding to market restructuring and consumer demands. The company’s focus on information management capability underscores its commitment to providing data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, and security, tailored to changing business needs and directions. As the health care environment evolves, the organization recognizes the necessity of continuous investment in technology infrastructure and IT governance to ensure operational efficiency and compliance with regulatory requirements.

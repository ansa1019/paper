Management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition indicates that our long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on molecules currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. The increase in operating expense in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in marketing, selling, and administrative expense, which reflects our strategic resource allocation towards enhancing our operational capabilities. We recognized acquired in-process research and development charges of $1.11 billion in 2017, primarily related to the acquisition of Colucid Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which underscores our commitment to leveraging technology resources and capabilities to support business strategies. Our ability to manage research and development spending across our portfolio of molecules is critical, as a delay in or termination of any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending. The evolving landscape of regulatory agencies continues to establish increasingly high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products, which impacts our operational flexibility and market responsiveness. We face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates, which can have a substantial impact on our revenue, cost of sales, and operating expenses. The entry of generic competition for our products has caused a rapid and severe decline in revenue, which affects our market-based performance and necessitates a focus on innovation and business transformation. Our strategic management practices include monitoring the potential impacts of the economic environment and the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers. We also recognize the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other resources and capabilities to enhance organizational effectiveness. The 2017 tax act introduced significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system, which may influence our future effective tax rates and operational decisions. Our capital expenditures during 2017 were $1.08 billion, reflecting our investment in technology infrastructure and innovation partnerships to bolster future growth prospects. We continue to evaluate our strategic decisions regarding acquisitions, which require significant estimates and judgments that can materially affect our consolidated results of operations. The challenges inherent in human pharmaceutical research and development, including the high rate of failure in new drug discovery, necessitate a robust framework for information management and resource mobilization. Our organizational capabilities are further enhanced by our focus on digital transformation and IT governance, which are essential for maintaining competitive advantage in a rapidly changing market. We anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately 73 percent in 2018, driven by our ongoing commitment to operational efficiency and process optimization. The strategic alignment of our business strategies with market dynamics is crucial for sustaining our competitive positioning and achieving performance excellence.

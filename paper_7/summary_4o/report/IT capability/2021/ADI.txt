The pandemic caused by COVID-19 has impacted our workforce and operations, necessitating modifications to our business practices, including the coordination of our assets and internal processes. We have significant operations worldwide, which have been affected by the pandemic, resulting in disruptions at some of our manufacturing operations and facilities. We believe that our strategy and long-term contingency planning have positioned us well to weather the current uncertainty, emphasizing the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. The acquisition of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. has expanded our technology capabilities and is expected to enhance our operational efficiency and business innovation. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products, which we view as critical to our future growth. Our commitment to research and development is essential to maintain product leadership and to provide innovative new product offerings, thereby transforming our firm into a competitive force. The integration of Maxim has also involved significant estimation uncertainty in determining the fair value of identifiable intangible assets, which primarily consists of developed technology and customer relationships. This acquisition is expected to enhance our IT capabilities and support our business strategy alignment. Our cash management practices involve reviewing available funds held by our foreign subsidiaries and assessing the cost-effectiveness of accessing those funds, which is crucial for our operational flexibility and resource allocation. We monitor global macroeconomic conditions to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency, which is vital for our strategic resource allocation and investment decisions. The increase in accounts receivable and inventory levels during fiscal 2021 was primarily due to the acquisition and our efforts to balance manufacturing production, demand, and inventory levels. Our liquidity and capital resources are managed to ensure sufficient funding for operations, capital expenditures, and research and development efforts. We recognize the importance of IT governance and management capability in supporting our business needs and enhancing our overall organizational capabilities. The ongoing evaluation of our technology infrastructure and the strategic alignment of our IT systems are critical for maintaining competitive advantage and ensuring market responsiveness. The operational changes and restructuring actions taken in response to the acquisition are aimed at better aligning our global workforce with our long-term strategic plan, which underscores the significance of effective IT deployment and resource integration in achieving our organizational goals.

Abbvie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, advancing and investing in its pipeline, and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. The company's financial performance in 2018 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $32.8 billion, driven primarily by revenue growth related to Mavyret, Imbruvica, and Venclexta, and the continued strength of Humira. Abbvie intends to continue to advance its mission by growing revenues through diversifying revenue streams, driving late-stage pipeline assets to the market, and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches. The company anticipates several regulatory submissions and key data readouts from key clinical trials in the next twelve months, expecting to achieve its strategic objectives through effective management of Humira international biosimilar erosion and the favorable impact of pipeline products. Abbvie remains committed to driving continued expansion of operating margins and expects to achieve this objective through continued leverage from revenue growth, productivity initiatives in supply chain, and ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs, and general corporate expenses. Research and innovation are the cornerstones of Abbvie's business, as the company's long-term success depends on its ability to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development. Abbvie's pipeline currently includes more than 60 compounds or indications in clinical development, with significant programs and developments in immunology, oncology, and neuroscience. The company has initiated multiple phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of investigational therapies, demonstrating its commitment to transforming its capabilities in response to evolving market dynamics. Abbvie's financial results reflected continued added funding to support all stages of its emerging pipeline assets and continued investment in growth brands. The company has also established an allowance against accounts receivable when it is probable they will not be collected, reflecting its proactive approach to managing financial risks associated with its operations. Abbvie's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt, or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by material declines in demand for its products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers. The company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to support its growth objectives, which include leveraging its IT capabilities to enhance operational efficiency and improve decision-making speed. Abbvie's commitment to research and development is evident in its substantial investment in pipeline assets, reflecting a strategic resource allocation aimed at maximizing business value and ensuring competitive positioning in the biopharmaceutical industry. The company's focus on innovation partnerships and strategic management practices underscores its intent to enhance its organizational capabilities and drive performance improvements across its operations.

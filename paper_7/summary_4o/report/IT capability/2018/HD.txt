During fiscal 2018, we executed strategic efforts to drive an enhanced interconnected experience in both the physical and digital worlds. Online sales, which consist of sales generated online through our websites for products picked up in our stores or delivered to customer locations, represented 7.9% of net sales and grew 26.2% during fiscal 2018. The increase in comparable sales reflected a number of factors, including the execution of our strategy and broad-based growth across our stores and online. We believe that our current cash position, access to the long-term debt capital markets, and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases, and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $2.7 billion in fiscal 2019, which will support our investments in the business. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, operations, and occupancy costs. The increase in net earnings during fiscal 2018 was primarily due to a lower effective income tax rate resulting from the enactment of the tax act and higher comparable sales. The adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 benefited net sales by $216 million in fiscal 2018, reflecting our ability to adapt to regulatory changes and enhance our revenue recognition processes. Our total comparable sales increased 5.2% in fiscal 2018, driven by strong sales in big ticket purchases in certain categories, such as appliances and vinyl plank flooring. The increase in comparable average ticket was due in large part to these strong sales. We recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or when a service is performed, which reflects our commitment to providing timely and accurate information to our stakeholders. Our significant contractual obligations include purchase obligations that encompass legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, utility purchases, capital expenditures, and software acquisitions. We believe that our estimates of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period are an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors. Our self-insured retention for claims is limited to $25 million for general liability, which indicates our management of risk and operational efficiency. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, generally at the individual store level, ensuring that we effectively manage our resources and assess potential impairments. Our strategic management practices and investments in technology infrastructure are designed to enhance our operational capabilities and support our business transformation efforts. We have established liabilities for certain losses related to general liability, workers' compensation, and employee group medical claims, which are regularly reviewed to ensure appropriateness. Our ability to leverage IT resources effectively has become a key factor in transforming our firm into a competitive force, as we continue to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with other capabilities to further our organizational goals.

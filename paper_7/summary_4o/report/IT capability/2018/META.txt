In 2018, we continued to invest, based on our roadmap, in long-term technology initiatives, such as connectivity, artificial intelligence, and augmented and virtual reality, that we believe will further our mission to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. We anticipate that additional investments in expanding our data center capacity, network infrastructure, and office facilities will drive significant year-over-year expense growth. The increase in advertising revenue for 2018 was due to increases in the number of ads delivered and the average price per ad, which was driven by an increase in demand for our ad inventory. Factors contributing to the increase in demand for our ad inventory include an increase in spend from existing marketers and an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on our platform as well as the quality, relevance, and performance of those ads. We expect that future advertising revenue growth will be driven by a combination of price and the number of ads displayed. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products, including expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure. Research and development expenses increased due to an increase in payroll and benefits expense as a result of a growth in employee headcount in engineering and other technical functions. We plan to continue hiring software engineers and other technical employees to support our research and development initiatives. The increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure is expected to continue as we expand our capabilities to support user growth and engagement. Our marketing and sales expenses increased, driven by marketing, community operations, and payroll and benefits expenses. We are also increasing our investment in community operations to support our security efforts. The majority of our general and administrative expenses consist of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for our executives and administrative employees. We believe that our investments in technology and infrastructure will enhance our operational efficiency and support our business transformation efforts. Our principal sources of liquidity include cash generated from operations, which is expected to be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future. We are involved in legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries that could impact our financial position, and we continuously evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to these matters. The outcome of these matters is inherently uncertain and could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition. We have established a multi-currency notional cash pool for certain of our entities, which facilitates liquidity management across our global operations. The tax act imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings, which has implications for our cash flow and tax liabilities. We are monitoring developments in various legal and regulatory contexts that may influence our operational capabilities and strategic decisions moving forward.

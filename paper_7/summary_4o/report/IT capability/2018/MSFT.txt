Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more, striving to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. The industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models, presenting opportunities to conceive new products, technologies, or ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, competing for talent globally by offering an exceptional working environment and the ability to grow one's career across many different products and businesses. The investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive, with competitors developing new software and devices while deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. Our research and development activities seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces. The investments in cloud engineering and commercial sales capacity are essential for supporting our business transformation and enhancing our IT capabilities. Our IT capabilities, broadly defined as the IT functionâ€™s competence to effectively support business needs, have become key in transforming the firm into a competitive force. The integration of LinkedIn into our operations has provided significant revenue growth and enhanced our capabilities in productivity and business processes. Our financial performance reflects the adoption of new accounting standards for revenue recognition and leases, which had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The transition tax imposed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act significantly changes existing U.S. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business. We continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and technology to align with our business strategy. Our operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation are critical in responding to market dynamics and ensuring our competitive positioning. The ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with other resources and capabilities is vital for achieving organizational goals and enhancing performance outcomes. Our ongoing investments in research and development, particularly in cloud services and infrastructure, are designed to support our long-term growth and adaptability in a rapidly evolving market landscape.

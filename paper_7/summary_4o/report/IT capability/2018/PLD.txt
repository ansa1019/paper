During the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed significant activities that reflect our strategic resource allocation and operational flexibility. Our operating fundamentals remained strong, with occupancy rates at 97.5%, indicating effective management of our assets and internal processes. The DCT transaction, completed on August 22, 2018, for $8.5 billion, involved the issuance of $6.6 billion of equity and the assumption of $1.9 billion of debt, which underscores our capability to leverage financial resources in support of business strategies. The transaction allowed us to enhance our operational efficiency and focus on high-quality properties in prime markets, thereby transforming our portfolio in response to market dynamics. We generated net proceeds of $2.8 billion and realized net gains of $841 million from the contribution of properties to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, which illustrates our ability to mobilize resources effectively and manage interfirm transactions. Our strategic capital segment, which includes revenues from asset and property management, reflects our capability to adapt to changing business needs and directions, contributing to our overall firm performance. The revenues from this segment fluctuated due to changes in the number of real estate assets and the fair value of properties owned by ventures, indicating the importance of technology resources and management skills in navigating market conditions. The allocation of costs associated with property management and leasing functions demonstrates our commitment to optimizing internal processes and enhancing business value. Our operational metrics, including net operating income (NOI) by segment, provide insights into our core operations and performance linkage, further emphasizing our focus on business process management and strategic alignment. The strategic capital revenues and expenses highlight our capacity for innovation partnerships and the effective deployment of technology capabilities in managing our ventures. The ongoing evaluation of our business operations and the ability to respond to external influences, such as market volatility and regulatory uncertainty, are critical to maintaining our competitive advantage. Our commitment to information management capability ensures that we provide timely and reliable data to support decision-making processes, enhancing our organizational effectiveness and agility. The integration of technology infrastructure within our operational framework facilitates process optimization and supports our long-term investment strategies. As we continue to navigate the complexities of the business environment, our focus remains on leveraging IT capabilities to enhance firm performance and drive sustainable growth.

We have pioneered the next generation of security through our innovative security operating platform that empowers enterprises, service providers, and government entities to secure their organizations by safely enabling applications and data running in their networks, on their endpoints, and in the cloud, and by preventing breaches that stem from targeted cyberattacks. Our platform enables our end-customers to pursue transformative digital initiatives, like public cloud and mobility, that grow their business, while maintaining the visibility and control needed to protect their valued data and critical control systems. We believe the architecture of our platform offers superior performance compared to legacy approaches and reduces the total cost of ownership for organizations by simplifying their security operations and infrastructure and eliminating the need for multiple, stand-alone hardware and software security products. We continue to invest in innovation as we evolve and further extend the capabilities of our platform, as we believe that innovation and timely development of new features and products is essential to meeting the needs of our end-customers and improving our competitive position. We introduced several new offerings during fiscal 2018, including our globalprotect cloud service subscription, which provides our security operating platform as a cloud-based service for remote offices and mobile users; our logging service subscription, which functions as the central cloud-based repository for application data and logs generated by our security offerings; magnifier, a cloud-based subscription that enables organizations to identify and prevent behavior-based threats by applying machine learning to rich network, endpoint, and cloud data; pan-os 8.1, with over 60 new features; and traps 5.0, which included a cloud-delivered management service and integration with our logging service to allow for the collection of detailed endpoint event data. We also expanded the capabilities of our platform with extended protections to the GCP and enhanced capabilities for AWS and Azure environments to enable customers to easily integrate with their cloud infrastructure and workloads in multi-cloud environments. We believe that the growth of our business and our short-term and long-term success are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to extend our technology leadership, grow our base of end-customers, expand deployment of our platform and support offerings within existing end-customers, and focus on end-customer satisfaction. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. While these areas present significant opportunities for us, they also pose challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results. Our cost of product revenue includes allocated costs that consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount. We expect our cost of subscription and support revenue to increase as our installed end-customer base grows and adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings increases. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future products and services, although our research and development expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue. We expect sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our sales and marketing organizations to increase touch points with end-customers and to expand our international presence.

The objectives of our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are to provide users of our consolidated financial statements with a narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, and certain other factors that may affect future results. Our ability to acquire and retain branded customers is important to our business in the generation of revenues, and we believe our un-carrier strategy, along with ongoing network improvements, has been successful in attracting and retaining customers as evidenced by continued branded customer growth and improved branded postpaid phone and branded prepaid customer churn. The proposed merger with Sprint is expected to enable the rapid launch of a nationwide 5G network, accelerate innovation, and increase competition in the U.S. wireless, video, and broadband industries. Our acquisitions, including Layer3 TV, represent opportunities to acquire complementary services to advance our video strategy. Our operating expenses consist of costs directly attributable to providing wireless service through the operation of our network, including direct switch and cell site costs, maintenance, and associated labor costs. We recognize that our IT capabilities, broadly defined as the IT functionâ€™s competence to effectively support business needs, have become key in transforming our firm into a competitive force. The implementation of our new billing system and the continued build-out of our network infrastructure, including the deployment of low-band spectrum and 5G compatible radios, are critical to enhancing our operational efficiency and supporting our business strategies. Our management believes that the ongoing development and deployment of technology capabilities are essential for maintaining competitive advantage and achieving operational flexibility. The positive impact from the new revenue standard has been significant, and our adjusted EBITDA reflects the higher service revenues driven by growth in our average branded customer base. The strategic resource allocation towards technology infrastructure and digital transformation initiatives is expected to enhance our organizational capabilities and improve performance outcomes. Our focus on customer relationships and the ability to provide data and information with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, and reliability are vital for meeting changing business needs and directions. The successful integration of acquired entities, such as Layer3 TV, into our operational framework is anticipated to leverage our existing technology resources and enhance our service offerings. We continue to assess our technology portfolio and make actionable investments that align with our strategic objectives, ensuring that our IT governance supports our overall business strategy. The challenges associated with regulatory approvals and market dynamics necessitate a robust IT architecture that can adapt to evolving environmental factors and consumer demands. Our commitment to innovation and process optimization is reflected in our financial performance metrics, which indicate a strong linkage between our IT capabilities and market-based performance.

In this management's discussion and analysis, we describe the results of operations and the financial condition for us and our consolidated subsidiaries, including a discussion of our results of operations for 2018 compared to 2017 and 2017 compared to 2016. Our operating results tend to vary seasonally, reflecting market dynamics and consumer choice. We significantly expanded our desktop processor offerings in 2018, which demonstrates our capability to innovate and respond to business needs. The increase in average selling price and unit shipments was primarily driven by higher demand for our Ryzen processors, showcasing our operational efficiency and ability to leverage technology resources. Research and development expenses increased, driven by product engineering and design-related costs, which are essential for enhancing our IT capabilities and supporting business strategies. The improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by the ramp of new products with higher gross margins than the corporate average, indicating a successful alignment of our technology portfolio with market demands. Our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balance, along with our secured revolving line of credit, will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, over the next 12 months, reflecting our strategic resource allocation and financial management capabilities. We believe our IT capabilities, including information management and data analytics, are crucial for transforming our firm into a competitive force. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC server products, partially offset by lower semi-custom revenue, indicating our ability to adapt to changing market conditions. The analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to our revenue and inventory valuation, which are critical for maintaining operational flexibility and ensuring information reliability. Our international sales as a percentage of net revenue increased, driven by higher revenue from China and Taiwan, reflecting our ability to manage external relationships and capitalize on global market opportunities. As of December 29, 2018, we were in compliance with all required covenants stated in our loan agreement, demonstrating our organizational effectiveness and governance capabilities. The agreements governing our debt obligations contain cross-default provisions, which highlight the importance of strategic management practices in mitigating financial risks. Our operating activities generated net cash provided, primarily due to changes in working capital, indicating effective resource management and operational agility. The improvement in operating income was driven by higher demand for Ryzen and Radeon products, partially offset by increased operating expenses, underscoring the need for continuous investment in IT capabilities to support business innovation and transformation.

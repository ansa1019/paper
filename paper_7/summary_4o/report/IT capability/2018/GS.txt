The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. emphasizes the importance of effective risk management, which is critical to its success and involves a comprehensive, integrated approach to managing risks associated with its business activities. The firm has established a governance structure that includes the board and various risk committees overseeing risk management policies and practices. The enterprise risk management framework is designed to enable comprehensive risk management processes that identify, assess, monitor, and manage risks, including liquidity, market, credit, operational, model, legal, compliance, conduct, regulatory, and reputational risks. The firm employs a dynamic limit-setting framework to monitor compliance with established market risk limits and to report exposures, ensuring that risks are managed within prescribed limits. The risk management systems allow for independent calculations of value-at-risk (VaR) and stress measures, capturing risk measures at individual position levels and producing timely reports for senior management. The firm also utilizes stress testing as a method to analyze vulnerabilities and assess capital adequacy, incorporating various hypothetical stress scenarios that combine financial and non-financial risks. The operational risk management framework is designed to minimize operational risks through a comprehensive control framework, including training and development of personnel, independent oversight, and proactive communication. The management of credit risk includes assessing the likelihood of counterparty defaults and measuring current and potential credit exposure. The firm employs credit risk mitigants, including collateral and hedging, to reduce exposures. The firm’s liquidity risk management principles focus on maintaining sufficient liquidity to cover potential cash and collateral needs during stressed periods, supported by a robust liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) framework. The firm also engages in regular stress tests to ensure adequate liquidity and funding, assessing the impact of various market conditions on its liquidity profile. The integration of technology into risk management processes is evident, as the firm utilizes advanced systems to capture and analyze risk data, facilitating informed decision-making. The firm’s approach to technology risk management includes oversight of cyber security matters and the effectiveness of technology risk management frameworks. The emphasis on operational efficiency and the deployment of technology resources are crucial for maintaining competitive advantage and ensuring organizational effectiveness. The firm’s investment in technology capabilities supports its strategic objectives and enhances its ability to respond to market dynamics and external influences. Overall, Goldman Sachs’ commitment to leveraging technology in its risk management and operational processes underscores its focus on achieving business innovation and transformation while managing the complexities of the financial landscape.

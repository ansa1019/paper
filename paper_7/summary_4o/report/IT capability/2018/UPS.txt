During 2018, we achieved solid operating profit growth, although our U.S. domestic segment was negatively impacted by planned costs related to our transformation strategy and the impact of bringing new facility and technology projects online. The benefits of our efficiency and growth initiatives in the U.S. will not be fully realized until future periods. We believe that these adjusted financial measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and analysts in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Our operating expenses increased significantly, driven by higher pickup and delivery costs, the costs of operating our domestic integrated air and ground network, and the costs of package sorting, which were influenced by the expansion of our technology-enabled network. We continue to deploy and utilize technology to increase package sorting and delivery productivity, which is crucial for maintaining operational efficiency and responding to market dynamics. The growth in our technology infrastructure is part of our multi-year investment program in our smart logistics network, which impacts all asset categories, including information technology. This investment program aims to enhance our operational flexibility and improve our service offerings in response to consumer demands and market agility. Our strategic resource allocation reflects our commitment to leveraging technology capabilities to support business needs and enhance firm performance. The increase in operating expenses was also attributed to rising fuel prices and higher employee compensation costs, which were necessary to support our expanding technology initiatives. Additionally, we recognized pre-tax transformation strategy costs that reflect the ongoing investment in our digital transformation efforts. The adjustments to our financial measures exclude items that may not be indicative of our underlying operating results, providing a useful baseline for analyzing trends in our businesses. Our focus on information management capability ensures that we provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, and security, which is essential for effective decision-making and operational efficiency. We are committed to optimizing our capital structure and evaluating opportunities for actionable investments that align with our strategic goals. Our ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with other capabilities is critical for achieving competitive advantage and enhancing our organizational effectiveness. The transformation strategy costs incurred during the year are expected to yield long-term benefits, contributing to our overall business innovation and transformation objectives. As we continue to navigate market dynamics and external influences, our strategic alignment with technology capabilities will be integral to driving performance gains and ensuring sustained organizational performance.

Servicenow is a leading provider of cloud-based solutions that define, structure, manage, and automate services across the global enterprise. By applying a service-oriented lens to the activities, tasks, and processes that comprise day-to-day work life, we help the modern enterprise operate faster and be more scalable than ever before. We continue to invest in the development of our services, infrastructure, and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth. Our upsell rate, which is important for generating additional sales from existing customers, was 36%, 31%, and 30% for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Our renewal rate was 97%, 96%, and 97% for the same periods. We believe our total customer count is a key indicator of our market penetration, growth, and future revenues. As of December 31, 2014, our total customer count was 2,725, reflecting our aggressive investment in our direct sales force and additional partnerships with our indirect sales channel. Our subscription revenues, which provide customers access to the ordered subscription service, related support, and updates, increased significantly, driven by upsells, renewals, and an increase in our customer count. The average contract term for new customers and upsells remained stable, indicating our ability to meet business needs and adapt to market dynamics. We expect our cost of subscription revenues to increase in absolute dollar terms as we provide subscription services to more customers, but we anticipate that this increase will be at a slower rate than the increase in our subscription revenue, leading to a slight increase in our subscription gross profit percentage. Our investments in cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment and data center capacity are essential for supporting our growth and enhancing our IT capabilities. We recognize that effective IT governance and resource management are critical for maintaining operational efficiency and achieving strategic objectives. Our professional services revenues, which consist of fees associated with the implementation and configuration of our subscription service, also increased due to the growing services provided to our customer base. We expect research and development expenses to increase as we continue to improve the existing functionality of our services and develop new applications to fill market needs. Our sales and marketing expenses increased significantly, reflecting our focus on expanding our direct sales force and increasing brand awareness. We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents balance and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including the expansion of data centers and investments in office facilities. Our financial performance is influenced by various factors, including market responsiveness, competitive positioning, and the ability to leverage technology resources effectively. The strategic alignment of our business processes and technology capabilities is essential for driving performance gains and enhancing customer value.

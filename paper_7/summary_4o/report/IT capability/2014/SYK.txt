Stryker is one of the world's leading medical technology companies, and our success in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate depends to a large degree on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products. We are committed to internal innovation to develop products and services that improve outcomes and deliver greater cost savings and efficiencies and to augment our efforts with focused acquisitions. Our goal is to drive sales growth at the high end of the medtech industry and maintain our capital allocation strategy that prioritizes acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases. In 2014, we achieved sales growth of 7.3%, and we converted our sales growth into a 5.3% growth in adjusted net earnings per diluted share. We continued our capital allocation strategy by investing $916 million in acquisitions, which strengthens our operational efficiencies and simplifies our customers' experience. Research, development, and engineering expenses represented 6.3% of sales in 2014, driven by the impact of acquisitions and our continued investment in new technologies. Our selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 5.4% in 2014, reflecting strong sales growth and cost improvement efforts. These expenses included acquisition and integration-related charges, which are critical for leveraging our IT capabilities and enhancing our operational flexibility. Our operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures, and we manage capital spending to support our business growth, including information technology infrastructure upgrades. We believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and ready access to capital markets at competitive rates. We have established a European regional headquarters to support the growth of our global business and enhance our brand in Europe. Our investments in technology infrastructure and operational efficiencies are essential for maintaining our competitive advantage and responding to market dynamics. The integration of acquired businesses and the development of innovative products are key components of our strategy to enhance our IT capabilities and support our business needs. We continually evaluate our receivables and maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, which reflects our commitment to effective resource management and operational efficiency. Our strategic resource allocation and investment decisions are guided by the need to optimize our technology capabilities and enhance our organizational performance. The outcomes of our various ongoing proceedings and legal actions may impact our financial position, but we believe that our current reserves related to receivables are adequate. We have not recognized any impairment charges for goodwill during the years presented, as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values exceeded their respective recorded values. Our future contractual obligations include agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business, which are integral to our operational processes and resource deployment strategies.

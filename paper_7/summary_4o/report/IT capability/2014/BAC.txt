The corporation recognizes the importance of information management capability, which encompasses the provision of data and information to users with requisite accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access. This capability is crucial for adapting to changing business needs and directions. Furthermore, the report underscores that IT capability is essential for mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in conjunction with leveraging other resources and capabilities, thereby transforming the firm into a competitive force. The application of IT resources, including technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, and business process understanding, is identified as a means to further organizational goals and enhance overall firm performance. The strategic alignment of IT capabilities with business strategies is positioned as a key driver of operational efficiency and competitive advantage, reflecting the corporation's commitment to leveraging technology for business innovation and transformation.
The performance measures we utilize, including the efficiency ratio and net interest yield, are based on net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis, which reflects our ability to generate revenue efficiently. We also assess our business using ratios that incorporate tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts shareholders' equity by excluding goodwill and intangible assets. This analysis supports our growth goals through profitability, relationship, and investment models, focusing on return on average tangible common shareholders' equity and return on average tangible shareholders' equity. Our efficiency ratio, which measures costs relative to revenue generation, and net interest yield, which indicates our earnings over the cost of funds, are critical in evaluating our operational effectiveness and strategic resource allocation. 

In managing our business segments, we apply non-GAAP measures to assess performance, including return on average allocated capital, which is calculated by adjusting net income for costs associated with funds and certain intangible expenses. This approach allows us to align our capital allocation with regulatory requirements and internal risk assessments, enhancing our operational flexibility and strategic management practices. 

Our consumer and business banking segment, which encompasses a wide range of banking and investment services, has seen net income growth driven by improved credit quality and operational efficiencies. The integration of digital technologies and enhancements in our banking infrastructure have facilitated better customer engagement and service delivery, contributing to our competitive advantage in the market. 

In the global wealth and investment management segment, we focus on providing tailored solutions to high-net-worth clients, leveraging our technology capabilities to enhance client experiences and operational efficiency. The increase in assets under management and brokerage assets reflects our strategic alignment with market demands and consumer preferences, demonstrating our capability to adapt to changing market dynamics.

Overall, our investment in IT capabilities and digital transformation initiatives is integral to our business strategy, enabling us to optimize processes, enhance customer relationships, and improve performance metrics across all segments. This strategic focus on technology deployment and operational efficiency is essential for sustaining competitive positioning and achieving long-term business value.
Global Banking provides a comprehensive range of lending-related products and services, integrated working capital management, and treasury solutions to clients, while also offering investment banking products such as debt and equity underwriting and advisory services. The net income for Global Banking increased to $5.4 billion in 2014, primarily due to a reduction in the provision for credit losses and an increase in revenue, which was partially offset by higher noninterest expenses. Revenue growth was driven by higher net interest income, with the provision for credit losses decreasing significantly due to improved credit quality. Noninterest expense increased primarily due to additional client-facing personnel and litigation expenses. The return on average allocated capital was 18 percent in 2014, reflecting a decrease from the previous year as earnings growth was offset by increased capital allocations.

Global Corporate and Global Commercial Banking activities include business lending and global transaction services. Business lending revenue remained stable, while global transaction services revenue increased due to growth in deposit balances. Average loans and leases in these segments grew by five percent, driven by commercial and industrial portfolios, and average deposits increased by ten percent due to client liquidity and international growth.

In the Global Markets segment, net income rose significantly to $2.7 billion, with sales and trading revenue reflecting a mix of unrealized and realized gains, net interest income, and fees from commissions. The segment provides market-making and risk management products across various asset classes, and the economics of investment banking activities are shared between Global Markets and Global Banking. Noninterest expenses decreased due to lower litigation costs and revenue-related incentives, although technology costs and infrastructure investments increased.

Overall, the financial performance across segments indicates a focus on enhancing operational efficiency and leveraging technology investments to support business innovation and client services, while navigating market dynamics and regulatory contexts. The strategic management of resources and capabilities is evident in the efforts to optimize balance sheets and enhance service offerings in response to consumer demands and competitive pressures.
The use of the MERS system for residential mortgage loans in our servicing portfolio has been contested by individuals and local governments, raising concerns about its validity and potential adverse effects on security interests. Should documentation requirements not be met, or if MERS is deemed ineffective, we may need to undertake remedial actions, incurring additional costs or losses. Foreclosure delays have impacted our default-related servicing costs, which peaked in mid-2013 and have since declined, although unexpected delays could hinder this trend. In 2014, we recorded $14 million in mortgage-related assessments and similar costs due to foreclosure delays, a significant decrease from $514 million in 2013. We continue to face litigation and regulatory scrutiny regarding our origination, servicing, and foreclosure activities, which may lead to increased operational and compliance costs and limit our ability to provide certain products and services. The ongoing regulatory environment has necessitated the implementation of uniform servicing standards aimed at enhancing procedural safeguards and documentation requirements, which, while contributing to elevated servicing costs, are not expected to materially disrupt our mortgage servicing obligations. Our risk management framework is integral to our operations, addressing strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational, and reputational risks. Strategic risk arises from incorrect assumptions or ineffective execution of business strategies, particularly in response to regulatory and competitive changes. We assess our risk appetite annually, aligning it with our strategic and financial plans, and ensuring that our capital allocations are consistent with our risk capacity. Our risk management processes, including the identification, measurement, monitoring, and control of risks, are embedded in our daily operations and strategic planning. We conduct corporation-wide stress tests to evaluate the impact of adverse economic scenarios on our capital and liquidity, ensuring we maintain adequate capital to support our business activities and meet regulatory requirements. The Basel 3 regulatory framework significantly influences our capital management practices, requiring us to maintain sufficient capital ratios and comply with evolving capital requirements. Our capital composition and ratios are regularly assessed to ensure alignment with regulatory standards and to support our strategic objectives.
At December 31, 2014, Bank of America reported a common equity tier 1 capital of $155,361 million under Basel 3 transition rules, reflecting an increase in capital ratios that could be achieved through risk-weighted asset reductions. The bank's risk-weighted assets decreased by $36 billion during 2014, primarily due to reductions in market risk and consumer credit balances. The capital ratios, including tier 1 leverage, were influenced by strategic decisions regarding capital allocation and risk management, which are essential for maintaining competitive advantage in a dynamic market environment. The bank's governance framework for liquidity risk management emphasizes centralized oversight, enabling effective monitoring of liquidity requirements and access to diverse funding sources. This centralized approach enhances operational flexibility and supports timely responses to liquidity events, which are critical for maintaining organizational effectiveness. The bank's liquidity risk management practices include maintaining excess liquidity and performing stress testing scenarios, which are integral to ensuring compliance with Basel 3 liquidity standards. The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) are key metrics for assessing the bank's liquidity position, with the LCR calculated as the amount of high-quality liquid assets relative to estimated net cash outflows during periods of significant liquidity stress. The bank's diversified funding strategy, which includes a mix of deposits and secured liabilities, is designed to optimize resource deployment and reduce funding costs, thereby enhancing overall operational efficiency. The bank's credit ratings, which are influenced by its liquidity position and governance practices, play a significant role in its ability to raise funds and manage liquidity risks effectively.
Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower's credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience. These models are a component of our consumer credit risk management process and are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk. Improved credit quality, increased home prices, and continued loan balance run-off across the consumer portfolio drove a $3.4 billion decrease in the consumer allowance for loan and lease losses in 2014 to $10.0 billion at December 31, 2014. The residential mortgage portfolio makes up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 44 percent of consumer loans and leases at December 31, 2014. Approximately 24 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio is in wealth management and represents residential mortgages that are originated for the home purchase and refinancing needs of our wealth management clients. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $12.5 billion, or 23 percent at December 31, 2014. Loans in our home equity portfolio generally have an initial draw period of 10 years and more than 75 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2016 or later. We communicate to contractually current customers more than a year prior to the end of their draw period to inform them of the potential change to the payment structure before entering the amortization period, and provide payment options to customers prior to the end of the draw period. The net charge-off ratios for 2014 and 2013 were also impacted by lower outstanding balances primarily as a result of paydowns and charge-offs outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines.

The management of adverse changes in the economic value of non-trading positions due to interest rate fluctuations is conducted through asset-liability management (ALM) activities. The corporation has opted to account for specific assets and liabilities under the fair value option, with trading positions reported at fair value and changes reflected in income. Various market-based risk factors, including interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity, and commodities markets, generate the majority of this risk. The corporation employs a range of techniques to manage these risk exposures, utilizing financial instruments and quantitative risk models, such as Value at Risk (VaR), to evaluate market risks within portfolios. A subcommittee designated by the Market Risk Committee (MRC) oversees risk governance for global markets, focusing on proactive risk mitigation strategies.

Interest rate risk is identified as a significant exposure, with instruments such as loans, debt securities, and derivatives being sensitive to changes in interest rates. Hedging instruments, including options, futures, forwards, and swaps, are utilized to mitigate these risks. Foreign exchange risk arises from changes in values of holdings and future cash flows in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, with similar hedging strategies employed. Mortgage risk is also highlighted, as the values of mortgage-related instruments are sensitive to various market factors, including interest rate volatility.

The corporation's operational risk management framework defines operational risk as the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, which is critical in the context of diversified financial services. This risk is significant in calculating total risk-weighted assets under Basel III capital estimates. The corporation continuously monitors and evaluates its risk management practices, ensuring alignment with regulatory requirements and industry best practices. The integration of risk management practices across the organization supports effective decision-making and enhances overall organizational capabilities in managing financial risks.
We approach operational risk management from two perspectives within the structure of the corporation: at the enterprise level to provide independent, integrated management of operational risk across the organization, and at the business and control function levels to address operational risk in revenue producing and non-revenue producing units. The operational risk management program addresses the overarching processes for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling operational risk, and reporting operational risk information to management and the board. A sound internal governance structure enhances the effectiveness of the corporation's operational risk management program and is accomplished at the enterprise level through formal oversight by the board, the ERC, the CRO and a variety of management committees and risk oversight groups aligned to the corporation's overall risk governance framework and practices. The MRC oversees the corporation's policies and processes for sound operational risk management. Independent operational risk management teams oversee the businesses and control functions to monitor adherence to the operational risk management program and advise and challenge operational risk exposures. Within the global risk management organization, the corporate operational risk team develops and guides the strategies, enterprise-wide policies, practices, controls and monitoring tools for assessing and managing operational risks across the organization and reports results to businesses, control functions, senior management, governance committees and the ERC and the board. The businesses and control functions are responsible for assessing, monitoring and managing all the risks within their units, including operational risks. In addition to enterprise risk management tools such as loss reporting, scenario analysis and RCSAs, operational risk executives, working in conjunction with senior business executives, have developed key tools to help identify, measure, monitor and control risk in each business and control function. Examples of these include personnel management practices; data reconciliation processes; fraud management units; cybersecurity controls, processes and systems; transaction processing, monitoring and analysis; business recovery planning; and new product introduction processes. The goals of this process are to assess changing market and business conditions, evaluate key risks impacting each business and control function, and assess the controls in place to mitigate the risks. Key operational risk indicators for these risks have been developed and are used to assist in identifying trends and issues on an enterprise, business and control function level. Independent review and challenge to the corporation's overall operational risk management framework is performed by the corporate operational risk program adherence team and reported through the operational risk governance committees and management routines. Where appropriate, insurance policies are purchased to mitigate the impact of operational losses. The inclusion of these insurance policies is subject to reductions in their expected mitigating benefits. The process of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses requires a high degree of judgment. Changes to any one of these factors could significantly impact the estimate of our liability. The estimate of the liability for obligations under representations and warranties is based upon currently available information, significant judgment, and a number of factors, including those set forth above, that are subject to change. The methodology used to estimate the liability for obligations under representations and warranties related to transfers of residential mortgage loans is a function of the representations and warranties given and considers a variety of factors. The estimate of the liability for representations and warranties provision may vary significantly each period as the methodology used to estimate the expense continues to be refined based on the level and type of repurchase requests presented, defects identified, the latest experience gained on repurchase requests and other relevant facts and circumstances. The estimate of the liability for representations and warranties is sensitive to future defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate.

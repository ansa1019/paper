We are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products, and services, including information technology. Our strategy focuses on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of product delivery, and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our customers at affordable prices. We continue to invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers and invest in our people to ensure we have the technical skills necessary to succeed. Our information systems & global solutions (IS&GS) business segment provides advanced technology systems and integrated information technology solutions across various applications for government customers. The IS&GS segment has been impacted by downturns in federal agencies' information technology budgets and increased re-competition on existing contracts. We have made acquisitions to enhance our technology capabilities, including systems made simple, which provides solutions leveraging information technology in healthcare, and zeta associates, which designs systems for intelligence and defense communities. Our investments in technology are aligned with critical national priorities and mission areas, and we seek to lessen our dependence on U.S. government contracts by expanding into adjacent markets and growing international sales. We have experienced increased market pressures in our services businesses, including lower in-theater support and increased re-competition on existing contracts. Our operational flexibility and capability to respond to market dynamics are essential as we navigate the complexities of the global security environment. We utilize the percentage-of-completion method for accounting for our contracts, which requires significant estimates and assumptions regarding costs and revenues. Our ability to recover costs, including those related to environmental remediation, is influenced by our compliance with U.S. government regulations. We closely monitor compliance with critical accounting policies related to contract accounting and actively manage our pension costs in alignment with government contracts. The enactment of the hatfa has impacted our pension funding requirements, and we expect to recover significant pension costs through our pricing of products and services. Our ongoing assessment of goodwill impairment reflects the challenges posed by market pressures and budget reductions affecting our primary customer, the U.S. government. The uncertainty in the business environment necessitates a focus on enhancing our IT capabilities to maintain competitive advantage and support our strategic objectives. We continue to evaluate our technology resources and capabilities to ensure alignment with our business needs and market demands, thereby fostering innovation and operational efficiency across our operations.

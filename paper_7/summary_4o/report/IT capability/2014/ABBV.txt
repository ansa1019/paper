Abbvie has and will continue to incur additional ongoing operating expenses to operate as an independent company, including the cost of various corporate headquarters functions, incremental information technology-related costs, and incremental costs to operate a stand-alone back office infrastructure outside the United States. The company's transition services agreements with Abbott in the United States cover certain corporate support services that Abbvie has historically received from Abbott, including information technology, accounts payable, payroll, and other financial functions. These agreements facilitate the separation by allowing Abbvie to operate independently prior to establishing stand-alone back office functions across its organization. As of the date of the separation, Abbvie did not have sufficient back office infrastructure to operate in markets outside the United States. As a result, Abbvie entered into transition services agreements with Abbott to provide services outside the United States, including back office services in certain countries, for up to three years after separation. These back office services include information technology, accounts payable, payroll, receivables collection, treasury, and other financial functions, as well as order entry, warehousing, and other administrative services. The transition services agreements have allowed Abbvie to operate its international pharmaceuticals business independently prior to establishing a stand-alone back office infrastructure for all countries. During the transition from Abbott, Abbvie has and will continue to incur non-recurring expenses to expand its international infrastructure. Abbvie's financial performance in 2014 included delivering fully diluted earnings per share of $1.10, which reflects the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. The company expects to achieve operating margin improvements while continuing to invest in its pipeline in support of opportunities in oncology, HCV, and immunology, as well as continued investment in key products. Abbvie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results and returns for shareholders while ensuring a strong sustainable growth business over the longer term. The company has augmented its pipeline through strategic licensing and partnering activities, which underscores the importance of IT capability in supporting business needs and enhancing operational efficiency. Abbvie's investments in information technology resources are essential for maintaining competitive advantage and facilitating business transformation. The company's ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access is critical in responding to changing business needs and directions. Abbvie's IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, and business process understanding to further organizational goals. The transition services agreements with Abbott have allowed Abbvie to maintain operational flexibility and market responsiveness during its establishment as an independent entity, highlighting the role of IT governance and resource mobilization in achieving strategic objectives.

TJX provides projections and other forward-looking statements particularly relating to our future financial performance, which are estimates based on information currently available and subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Our mission is to deliver great value to our customers every day, which we achieve by selling a rapidly changing assortment of merchandise at prices generally 20% to 60% below full-price retailers. We operate over 4,900 stores through our four main segments and have returned $4.0 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our consolidated average per store inventories were up 1% at the end of fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year. The increase in net sales reflects a 5% increase in comp store sales, driven by an increase in customer transactions. The increase in segment profit margin was primarily driven by higher merchandise margin, partially offset by incremental store wage and payroll costs. Our e-commerce sites represented less than 3% of net sales for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 and did not have a significant impact on year-over-year segment margin comparisons. We expect our capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 will be in the range of approximately $2.0 billion to $2.1 billion, including approximately $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion for our offices and distribution centers to support growth, including buying and merchandising systems and other information systems. We monitor debt financing markets on an ongoing basis and may incur additional long-term indebtedness depending on various factors. Our liquidity requirements have traditionally been funded through cash generated from operations, supplemented by short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper. Net cash provided by operating activities was $6.1 billion in fiscal 2024, primarily due to an increase in net income and changes in accrued expenses. The increase in general corporate expense for fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by higher incentive and share-based compensation costs. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on "segment profit or loss," which we define as pre-tax income or loss before general corporate expense and interest expense, net. The increase in comp store sales was driven by an increase in customer transactions, reflecting our operational flexibility and responsiveness to market dynamics. Our IT capabilities, including information management capability, have been evolving to support and enhance business strategies and work processes, emphasizing the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. The increase in segment profit margin was primarily driven by higher merchandise margin, reflecting lower freight costs and higher markon, while our e-commerce operations continue to expand, contributing to our overall business performance. The increase in comp store sales for fiscal 2024 was driven by strong customer engagement and operational efficiency, demonstrating our ability to adapt to changing consumer demands and market conditions.

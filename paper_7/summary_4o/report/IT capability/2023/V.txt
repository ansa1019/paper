We provide transaction processing services to our financial institution and merchant clients through Visanet, our proprietary advanced transaction processing network, which underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources. Our net revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa products and the number of transactions processed on our network, reflecting our capability to leverage technology resources to enhance business strategies and work processes. The acquisition of Pismo, a cloud-native issuer processing and core banking platform, is expected to enhance our IT capabilities and operational flexibility, supporting our strategic resource allocation and investment decisions.

Technology is the foundation of our company, and we make our investments with an eye towards long-term strengthening and leveraging of competitive advantages. Our strategy to maximize long-term free cash flow per share growth includes discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities, which spans how we select R&D projects, develop new capabilities, and invest in new manufacturing capacity. We believe that our business model, combined with our four competitive advantages, sets us apart from our peers. Our focus on analog and embedded processing products allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations, underscoring the strength of our business model and the quality of our product portfolio. We invested $3.69 billion in R&D and SG&A, reflecting our commitment to strengthening our competitive advantages. Our capital expenditures were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and facilities, and we expect these expenditures to continue to be higher than historical levels as we invest to strengthen our competitive advantage in manufacturing and technology as part of our long-term capacity planning. The enactment of the U.S. Chips and Science Act provides funding for manufacturing grants and research investments, which aligns with our strategic focus on enhancing our IT capabilities and operational efficiency. Our liquidity and capital resources, primarily sourced from cash flow from operations, are essential for funding our working capital needs, capital expenditures, and other business requirements. We recognize that our ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with other resources and capabilities is crucial for achieving our organizational goals and enhancing our market-based performance. Our strategic focus on efficiency means constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent, which is essential for maintaining our competitive positioning in the market. The integration of technology into our operations supports our business process management and enhances our organizational capabilities. Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined based on design and development requirements, product characteristics, and how management allocates resources and measures results. We believe that our focus on technology management and strategic resource allocation will continue to provide us with actionable options for growth and performance improvement. Our commitment to information management capability allows us to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access, which is essential for responding to changing business needs and directions. The coordination of our assets and internal processes, along with our interfirm transactions and relationships, underscores the importance of our IT capabilities in transforming our firm into a competitive force.

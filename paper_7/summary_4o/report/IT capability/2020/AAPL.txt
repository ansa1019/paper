The company continues to believe that focused investments in research and development are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the company's core business strategy. The company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis, aligning with the location of the company's customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The company's existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations. The company invests in manufacturing-related assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers' facilities and prepayments provided to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term agreements to secure the supply of inventory. The company's investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The company has entered into agreements to sell certain of its marketable securities with a promise to repurchase the securities at a specified time and amount as an additional short-term liquidity arrangement. The company believes its investments in technology and infrastructure are essential for operational efficiency and enhancing business processes. The company’s marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The company’s effective tax rate for both 2020 and 2019 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact of tax settlements, and tax benefits from share-based compensation. The company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation of manufacturing-related assets, and estimation of inventory purchase commitment cancellation fees. The company’s estimates of future product development plans and demand for its products are key inputs in determining the recoverability of manufacturing-related assets and assessing the adequacy of any purchase commitment cancellation fee accruals. The company’s ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access is crucial for meeting changing business needs and directions. The company’s IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, business process understanding, and human resources to further organizational goals. The company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as set forth in the risk factors section, indicating the importance of strategic resource allocation and management capability in navigating market dynamics. The company’s operational flexibility and IT investment decisions are integral to maintaining competitive advantage and responding to external influences in the business environment.

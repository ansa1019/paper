Information technology (IT) capabilities have been evolving in scope to more comprehensively encompass the coordination of a firm’s assets and internal processes and their interfirm transactions and relationships. IT capability is a firm's ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources in support and enhancement of business strategies and work processes. The ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access is emphasized, along with the ability to tailor these in response to changing business needs and directions. The notion of IT capability underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with, and leveraging the value of, other resources and capabilities. IT capability has become key in transforming a firm into a competitive force, representing the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, business process understanding, and human resources to further organizational goals. The firm’s ability to manage research and development spending across its portfolio of potential new medicines reflects its strategic resource allocation and operational flexibility. The ongoing investment in external research and technologies, including acquisitions and collaborations, is viewed as an important way to enhance shareholder value and bolster the pipeline. The firm continuously evaluates business development transactions that have the potential to strengthen its business, indicating a focus on capability development and strategic management practices. The management of risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates, currency values, and fair values of equity securities is also essential to maintaining operational efficiency and ensuring effective resource management. The firm’s approach to addressing foreign currency risk exposure and its use of derivative financial instruments to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates demonstrate its commitment to strategic alignment and operational effectiveness. The emphasis on maintaining a reliable supply chain and the ability to adapt to market dynamics, particularly in response to external influences such as the COVID-19 pandemic, highlights the importance of IT agility and organizational change. The firm's financial condition and liquidity are supported by its ability to generate operating cash flow and access to short-term and long-term borrowings, which are critical for funding existing and planned capital requirements. The strategic decisions made regarding investments, including those in digital technologies and innovation partnerships, are integral to enhancing the firm’s capabilities and ensuring competitive positioning in the market. The ongoing evaluation of market-based performance and the responsiveness to consumer demands further illustrate the firm’s focus on leveraging its IT capabilities to drive business transformation and value creation.

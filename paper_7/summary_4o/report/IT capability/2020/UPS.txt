During 2020, we began implementing our customer first, people led, innovation driven strategy, seeking to transform nearly every aspect of our business, improve financial performance, and provide the best customer experience. We focused on enhancing capabilities that we believe our customers value the most, specifically speed and ease of access to our services. Enhancements to our U.S. ground network were completed to improve time-in-transit, and we continued to deploy our digital access program into e-commerce platforms. The unexpected business shutdowns and government restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted demand for our services. In our global small package business, business-to-business activity declined, while we experienced a significant increase in business-to-consumer shipping, partially attributed to the capability enhancements. The market shift towards e-commerce is expected to persist, with a continuing high level of residential deliveries potentially increasing demand but also driving higher operating costs. Investments made to improve our ground network contributed to increased operating expenses. The pandemic also led to a reduction in global air cargo capacity, causing market rates to increase and resulting in heightened demand for our services. We believe we are well positioned for long-term growth, although the duration and severity of the pandemic remain uncertain. Our financial results for 2020 reflect revenue growth driven by increased business-to-consumer shipping, which was partly due to our investments in IT capabilities to enhance operational efficiency and customer service. The increase in average daily package volume was primarily driven by growth in e-commerce, which we believe has accelerated a long-term market shift. We also experienced growth from small and medium-sized businesses, as well as other large customers, due to our investments aimed at improving time-in-transit and our digital access platform. Operating expenses increased significantly due to higher pickup and delivery costs, driven by volume growth and the need for operational flexibility in response to changing market dynamics. We recognized a goodwill impairment charge related to the anticipated divestiture of our UPS Freight business, which is expected to allow us to focus on core business areas that drive the greatest value. Our ongoing transformation strategy costs reflect our commitment to enhancing our IT capabilities and overall operational effectiveness. We continue to evaluate opportunities for investment in technology initiatives and additional network capabilities to support our strategic objectives and improve our competitive positioning in the market. The integration of digital technologies into our operations is critical for maintaining agility and responsiveness to customer demands and market conditions. Our focus on IT capability development is essential for leveraging strategic resources and enhancing our overall organizational performance.

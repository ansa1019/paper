The adoption of da Vinci surgical systems has the potential to grow for those procedures that offer greater patient value than non-da Vinci alternatives, within the prevailing economics of healthcare providers. Our organization focuses on developing, marketing, and training for those products and targeted procedures where da Vinci can bring patient value relative to alternative treatment options and/or economic benefit to healthcare providers. We believe that our modest growth in da Vinci hysterectomy procedures was driven by an increasing proportion of these procedures consolidating to gynecologic oncologists, a group of surgeons more aligned with da Vinci surgical system utilization. Our strategy is to provide hospitals with attractive clinical and economic solutions in each procedure category, which reflects our commitment to leveraging technology capabilities to enhance operational efficiency and support business needs. The da Vinci surgical system can be used across a wide spectrum of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) procedures and has been optimized for multi-quadrant surgeries, which underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other capabilities. The da Vinci xi surgical system expands upon core features including wristed instruments, 3D HD visualization, and ergonomic design, while improving ease of use and delivering several new features that enhance operational flexibility and connectivity. Our research and development expenses have increased to support a broader set of product development initiatives, including advanced imaging and analytics, which are critical for enhancing our technology portfolio and ensuring alignment with market dynamics. The growth in our overall procedure volume has been driven by increased acceptance among surgeons and health systems, supported by expanded global evidence validating the clinical and economic value of da Vinci procedures. Our ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, and reliability is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and operational effectiveness. The recurring revenue from our installed base of da Vinci surgical systems reflects continued procedure adoption and the growing demand for our advanced instruments and services. We believe that our investments in research and development will continue to enhance our organizational capabilities and drive future growth. The strategic resource allocation towards developing innovative technologies and improving our service offerings is fundamental to our business model, which aims to optimize performance outcomes and ensure market responsiveness. The integration of advanced technologies into our surgical systems not only facilitates better surgical outcomes but also enhances the overall value chain by reducing transaction costs and improving patient care. Our focus on operational efficiency and process optimization is critical in navigating the evolving healthcare landscape and addressing the challenges posed by regulatory contexts and competitive actions. The strategic management of our technology infrastructure and resources will be vital in sustaining our market positioning and achieving long-term business resilience.

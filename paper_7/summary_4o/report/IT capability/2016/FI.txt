We are a leading global provider of financial services technology, offering account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, internet and mobile banking systems, and related services. Our operations are comprised of the payments segment and the financial institution services segment, which provide necessary services for our clients to operate their businesses. We continue to implement strategic initiatives to provide integrated technology and services solutions that enable best-in-class results for our clients, including enhancing client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. The financial industry is evolving rapidly, with new payment, deposit, lending, investment, and risk management products being introduced regularly. Financial institutions are increasingly focused on solutions that help them win and retain customers, generate incremental revenue, comply with regulations, and enhance operating efficiency. We anticipate that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to manage information and offer innovative new services to their customers in this competitive environment. The trend of financial institutions moving from in-house technology to outsourced solutions is expected to benefit us, as economies of scale in developing and maintaining the necessary infrastructure and technology are essential for competitiveness. Our sizable and diverse client base, combined with our position as a leading provider of non-discretionary, recurring revenue-based products and services, provides a solid foundation for growth. We believe that our products and services can assist financial institutions with regulatory and market challenges by providing new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce costs. Our revenue is primarily generated from account- and transaction-based fees under long-term contracts, which do not require significant judgments or assumptions in revenue recognition. The growth in our payments segment revenue has been driven by new client additions and increased transaction volumes, particularly in electronic payments and digital channels. Our operational effectiveness initiatives have improved our overall cost structure, and we expect continued revenue growth from our recurring revenue businesses. The integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients, enhancing our capability to support their business needs. We have made strategic acquisitions to enhance our suite of digital banking and payments solutions, which further underscores our commitment to innovation and operational effectiveness. Our focus on long-term client relationships and recurring, transaction-oriented products and services has reduced the impact of industry consolidation on our revenue. We continually evaluate our accounting policies and estimates to ensure they reflect our operational realities and market conditions, which is critical for maintaining our financial performance. The evolving regulatory landscape and cybersecurity scrutiny present challenges that necessitate robust information management capabilities to ensure compliance and operational efficiency. Our strategic resource allocation and management practices are designed to leverage our IT capabilities to support business transformation and enhance firm performance, ensuring we remain competitive in a rapidly changing market.

Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. Our strategy is to build best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world. We focus on transforming our organization to support our strategy of building best-in-class platforms and productivity services. Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, as we compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment and competitive compensation. The market for software, devices, and cloud-based services is dynamic and highly competitive, and we must continue to evolve and adapt over time. The investments we are making in devices and infrastructure will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. We achieved product development milestones, implemented organizational changes, and made strategic and tactical moves to support our central ambitions, including reinventing productivity and business processes and building the intelligent cloud platform. Intelligent cloud revenue increased primarily due to higher server products and cloud services revenue and enterprise services revenue. Our research and development expenses reflect increased investment in new products and services, including strategic investments and acquisitions to drive cloud sales capacity and innovation. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years in support of our productivity and platform strategy. We have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire LinkedIn, which is anticipated to accelerate the growth of our cloud services. Our organizational structure has been changed to align with our strategic direction as a productivity and platform company. We report our financial performance based on our new segments, productivity and business processes, intelligent cloud, and more personal computing, and analyze operating income as the measure of segment profitability. The integration of our cloud-based solutions has resulted in service revenue exceeding 10% of total revenue for the first time. The competitive landscape requires us to leverage our IT capabilities effectively to support business needs and enhance operational efficiency. Our IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources, such as technology, knowledge, practices, and management skills, to further organizational goals. We must continue to evolve and adapt our IT architecture and governance to meet the changing demands of the market and to maintain our competitive advantage. The dynamic capabilities of our organization are essential for responding to market changes and for optimizing our business processes.

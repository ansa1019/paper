Information technology (IT) capabilities have been evolving in scope to more comprehensively encompass the coordination of a firm’s assets and internal processes and their interfirm transactions and relationships. IT capability is a firm's ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources in support and enhancement of business strategies and work processes. The ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access is critical, as is the ability to tailor these in response to changing business needs and directions. Mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with, and leveraging the value of, other resources and capabilities is essential. A firm’s IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, business process understanding, and human resources to further organizational goals. The long-term success of our company depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on molecules currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We recognize that various risks and uncertainties may cause actual results and cash generated from operations to differ materially from expectations. The regulatory and legislative debate over access to and affordability of pharmaceuticals continues to drive market dynamics, influencing our business strategies and operational decisions. Consolidation and integration among healthcare providers are major factors in the competitive marketplace for human pharmaceuticals, enhancing purchasing strength and importance. The ability to manage research and development spending across our portfolio of molecules is crucial, as delays or terminations of projects will not necessarily cause significant changes in total spending. We face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates, which can impact revenue, cost of sales, and operating expenses. The impact of the Venezuelan financial crisis has also resulted in significant charges. Our effective tax rate reflects several factors, including the unfavorable tax effect of charges related to asset impairments and restructuring costs. We must make significant cost estimations and allocations, which sometimes rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms. Our acquisitions and collaborations require careful assessment of whether they should be accounted for as business combinations or asset acquisitions, which can materially affect our consolidated results of operations. The judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed can significantly impact our financial statements. We continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment, creditworthiness of our customers, and various international government funding levels. Our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values, which we manage through a controlled program of risk management. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition. The ability to leverage IT capabilities effectively supports our strategic resource allocation and enhances our organizational performance, ultimately contributing to our competitive positioning in the market.

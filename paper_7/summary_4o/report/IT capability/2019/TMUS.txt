The objectives of our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are to provide users of our consolidated financial statements with a narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results. Our ability to acquire and retain branded customers is important to our business in the generation of revenues, and we believe our un-carrier strategy, along with ongoing network improvements, has been successful in attracting and retaining customers as evidenced by continued branded customer growth and improved branded postpaid phone and branded prepaid customer churn. We expect the merger will be permitted to close in early 2020, and as a result of the merger, the combined company is expected to be able to build upon our recently launched foundational 5G network to deliver transformational broad, deep and nationwide 5G for all, accelerate innovation and increase competition in the U.S. wireless, video and broadband industries. Our operating income increased primarily due to higher service revenues, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and higher cost of services. The impact of merger-related costs was significant, and we recognized a positive impact from the new lease standard. Our ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities has become key in transforming the firm into a competitive force. We have disrupted the wireless communications services industry by actively engaging with and listening to our customers and eliminating their existing pain points, which underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT capabilities. The launch of America's first nationwide 5G network has enhanced our operational efficiency and market responsiveness, enabling us to better meet consumer demands and adapt to changing market dynamics. Our strategic resource allocation and investment decisions are focused on enhancing our technology infrastructure, which supports our business transformation and operational flexibility. The integration of our IT systems into our overall business strategy allows us to optimize our processes and improve our performance metrics. Our ongoing investments in technology capabilities, including the deployment of 5G and the expansion of our network infrastructure, are critical to maintaining our competitive advantage and achieving performance gains. We have also recognized the importance of information management capability, which includes providing data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access. The strategic alignment of our technology resources with our business needs is essential for achieving our organizational goals and enhancing our overall firm performance. Our management practices emphasize the importance of leveraging our IT capabilities to drive business innovation and improve customer relationships, which are vital for sustaining our market positioning and achieving long-term success.

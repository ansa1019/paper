Nee's operating performance is driven primarily by the operations of its two principal businesses, which reflect the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. The firm’s IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, business process understanding, and human resources to further organizational goals. Management uses adjusted earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, analysis of performance, and reporting of results to the board of directors, indicating a focus on actionable investments and strategic resource allocation. The company’s investments in plant in service and other property have contributed to its operational efficiency and business transformation, which are essential for maintaining competitive advantage in the market. 

In 2019, Nee's net income was affected by the absence of prior investment gains and higher contributions from new investments, which underscores the significance of IT investment in supporting business needs and enhancing firm performance. The operational results of its segments, including FPL and NEER, highlight the role of technology deployment and infrastructure capability in driving market-based performance and responding to market dynamics. The firm’s ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources is critical to its strategic management practices and operational flexibility.

Moreover, Nee's reliance on access to credit and capital markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements and other operations emphasizes the need for effective information management and organizational integration. The company's liquidity is supported by cash flows from operations and borrowings, which are essential for funding investments in technology and innovation partnerships. The management of counterparty credit risk through established policies and credit enhancements reflects the firm's commitment to maintaining information reliability and security in its operations.

The operational results indicate that the firm’s IT capabilities have been evolving to encompass the coordination of its assets and internal processes, which is vital for achieving organizational effectiveness and performance improvement. The integration of digital technologies and the focus on business process management are pivotal in enhancing the firm’s responsiveness to environmental factors and consumer demands. The strategic alignment of business strategies with technology capabilities is crucial for sustaining competitive positioning and achieving performance excellence in an increasingly dynamic business environment.

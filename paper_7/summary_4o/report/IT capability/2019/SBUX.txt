Starbucks results for fiscal 2019 reflect the impacts of continued streamlining efforts to focus on accelerating growth in high-returning businesses and converting several market operations to fully licensed models. The company has made strategic investments to support growth, particularly in China, which has implications for its IT capabilities as it integrates technology resources to enhance operational efficiency and market responsiveness. The growth in company-operated store revenues was driven by incremental revenues from new store openings and an increase in comparable store sales, indicating a strong alignment between business processes and IT capabilities. The company’s operational flexibility is enhanced by its ability to manage costs effectively, including the impact of licensing its CPG and foodservice businesses to Nestlé, which reflects a strategic resource allocation that leverages IT capabilities for better coordination of internal processes and interfirm transactions. Investments in technology infrastructure and digital platforms have been significant, with general and administrative expenses increasing due to higher performance-based compensation and costs related to digital innovations. The licensing agreement with Nestlé has also influenced the operational landscape, necessitating a focus on information management capabilities to ensure data accuracy and reliability in decision-making processes. The company’s ability to adapt to market dynamics is further supported by its investments in technology functionalities that facilitate communication and enhance customer relationships. The strategic management practices employed by Starbucks, including the evaluation of operational performance metrics, demonstrate a commitment to leveraging IT capabilities for business transformation and performance improvement. The organizational effectiveness is reflected in the company’s ability to respond to competitive actions and market restructuring, which requires a robust IT architecture that supports business innovation and process optimization. The integration of IT systems into the operational framework is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and ensuring that the firm can navigate external influences effectively. As Starbucks continues to evolve its business strategies, the emphasis on IT capability will be critical in driving performance gains and achieving long-term organizational goals, particularly in the context of globalization and changing consumer demands. The company’s focus on enhancing its digital infrastructure and capabilities will play a pivotal role in its ability to remain agile and responsive to market changes, thereby reinforcing its position as a leader in the retail coffee industry.

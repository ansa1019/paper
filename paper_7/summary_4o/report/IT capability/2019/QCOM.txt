In fiscal 2019, we expect our business, particularly QCT, to continue to be impacted by industry dynamics, including increased concentration of device share among a few companies, which results in significant supply chain leverage for those companies, thereby exacerbating the negative impact on our business and financial results. We believe that 5G technologies will empower a new era of smartphones and connected devices, driving transformation across industries beyond traditional cellular communications, which will create new business models and new services. We continue to invest significant resources to develop our wireless baseband chipsets and our converged computing/communications chipsets, which incorporate advancements in 4G and 5G, connectivity, power management, and artificial intelligence, contributing to the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio. Our investments in targeted opportunities leverage our existing technical and business expertise to enter and expand into new industry segments and applications, such as products for automotive, computing, IoT, and networking. 

We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing our intellectual property, which includes certain patent rights essential to the manufacture, sale, or use of wireless products. Our licensing revenues are based on sales of products incorporating our licensed intellectual property, which requires us to estimate and recognize royalties in the period in which the associated sales occur. The adoption of new revenue recognition guidance has resulted in an acceleration of royalty revenues by one quarter compared to prior periods. Our QTL results for fiscal 2019 included royalties from Apple and its contract manufacturers for sales made in the June and September 2019 quarters, reflecting the importance of our licensing agreements in supporting our business strategy.

We have initiated a series of targeted actions across our businesses with the objective to reduce annual costs, which includes significant management time and attention to address ongoing legal and regulatory proceedings. The unfavorable resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Our strategic resource allocation is also influenced by the regulatory context and market dynamics, which require us to adapt our operational flexibility and decision-making processes.

Our QCT segment has seen fluctuations in revenues based on consumer demand for devices, as well as on the timing of customer/device launches and innovation cycles, which are critical to maintaining our competitive advantage in the market. We expect to continue to face challenges related to competition and market restructuring, particularly as companies may choose to utilize their own internally-developed integrated circuit products. The impact of these decisions on our overall business could be significant, especially as we navigate the complexities of interfirm transactions and relationships in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.

Overall, our IT capabilities, which encompass the coordination of our assets and internal processes, are essential in transforming our firm into a competitive force in the market, underscoring the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other capabilities to enhance our organizational goals and performance.

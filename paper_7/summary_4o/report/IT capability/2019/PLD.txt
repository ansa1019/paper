During the year ended December 31, 2019, operating fundamentals remained strong for our O&M portfolio, which is impacted by our development, acquisition, and disposition activities. The operating fundamentals in the markets in which we operate continue to be strong, which has increased rents and kept occupancies high. Our financial condition and results of operations reflect the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. We evaluate our business operations based on the NOI of our two operating segments: real estate operations and strategic capital, which helps management and investors understand our operating results. The strategic capital segment includes revenues from asset and property management, which fluctuate because of changes in the size of the portfolios through acquisitions and dispositions. Our ability to generate cash from operating activities, distributions from our co-investment ventures, contributions, and dispositions of properties is adequate to meet our anticipated future development, acquisition, operating, debt service, dividend, and distribution requirements. We expect to fund our cash needs principally from available unrestricted cash balances, net cash flow from property operations, fees earned for services performed on behalf of the co-investment ventures, and proceeds from the disposition of properties. Our consolidated development portfolio, including properties under development and prestabilized properties, was 50.0% leased and expected to be completed before December 2021. The significant activities impacting our cash provided by operating activities include revenues from our real estate operations segment, which include noncash adjustments for straight-lined rents and amortization of above and below market leases. We also generate operating cash through our strategic capital segment by providing asset and property management and other services to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. Our strategic capital revenues are driven by the performance of our management and the performance of our properties in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods. We manage our business and compensate our executives based on the same store results of our O&M portfolio at 100% as we manage our portfolio on an ownership blind basis. The results of our same store portfolio are evaluated on a quarterly basis, and we consider NOI by segment to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance. Our ability to adapt to market dynamics and respond to business needs is critical in maintaining operational efficiency and achieving competitive advantage. The strategic decisions we make regarding resource allocation and investment opportunities are influenced by the evolving scope of our IT capabilities, which encompass the coordination of our assets and internal processes. We recognize the importance of information management capability, which includes the ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access. The integration of technology capabilities into our business processes is essential for enhancing organizational effectiveness and achieving performance gains. Our performance metrics reflect the linkage between our IT investment and overall firm performance, highlighting the role of technology in driving business transformation and innovation.

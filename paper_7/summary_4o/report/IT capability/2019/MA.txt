Mastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses, and other organizations worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks. We make payments easier and more efficient by providing a wide range of payment solutions and services using our family of well-known brands. Our payment solutions offer customers choice and flexibility and are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments system. The primary drivers of our net revenue growth were gross dollar volume growth, cross-border growth, switched transaction growth, and other revenues growth, which includes contributions from our cyber & intelligence and data & services solutions. The remaining growth was primarily driven by our continued investment in strategic initiatives, which reflects our commitment to enhancing our IT capabilities and operational efficiency. Our general and administrative expenses increased, primarily driven by an increase in personnel to support our continued investment in our strategic initiatives. The components of general and administrative expenses included data processing and telecommunications, which are critical for maintaining our IT infrastructure and capabilities. We rely on existing liquidity, cash generated from operations, and access to capital to fund our global operations, credit and settlement exposure, capital expenditures, and investments in our business. Our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions, which may influence our ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources effectively. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities balances, along with our cash flow-generating capabilities, are sufficient to satisfy our future operating cash needs and capital asset purchases. The effective income tax rate for 2019 was lower than the previous year, primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of earnings and discrete tax benefits, which may indirectly affect our investment decisions and resource allocation towards enhancing our IT capabilities. Our ongoing operations are evaluated using non-GAAP financial measures, which facilitate an understanding of our performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods. The adjustments we make to our financial measures exclude the impact of special items and gains and losses on equity investments, which allows us to focus on the underlying operational performance and the effectiveness of our IT capabilities in supporting business needs. We also manage foreign currency balance sheet remeasurement and transactional currency exposure through our foreign exchange risk management activities, which are essential for maintaining operational flexibility and ensuring the reliability of our financial reporting. Our strategic initiatives are aimed at enhancing our technology capabilities and ensuring that we remain competitive in the rapidly evolving payments landscape.

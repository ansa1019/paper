As a global investment firm, we are affected by financial and economic conditions globally, which have substantial impacts on our financial condition and results of operations, influencing the values of the investments we make, our ability to exit these investments profitably, and our ability to raise capital from investors. The recent outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) has added pressure to the economic outlook, which may disrupt marketplaces and businesses. Technological advancements and innovations may also disrupt our business environment, highlighting the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. Our ability to grow our revenues depends in part on our ability to attract new capital and investors, which is driven by the extent to which they see the alternative asset management industry and our investment products as attractive vehicles for capital appreciation or income. We have expanded into strategies such as energy, infrastructure, real estate, growth equity, and credit, which may require effective IT capabilities to manage and optimize these investments. Our ability to successfully deploy capital is influenced by market conditions, competition, and the overall economic environment, which may impact our ability to identify and execute attractive investments. The performance of our investments is significantly affected by global financial markets, and fluctuations in net gains from investment activities are driven primarily by changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio, which is closely tied to our IT capabilities in data management and analytics. Our operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation are critical in navigating market dynamics and responding to competitive actions. The integration of technology into our business processes enhances our capability to manage investments and relationships effectively, thereby contributing to our overall performance and competitive advantage. Furthermore, the management of our investment funds and the associated governance structures necessitate robust IT systems to ensure compliance, efficiency, and effective decision-making. Our investment strategies are supported by a technology infrastructure that facilitates communication and coordination across our organizational resources, enabling us to respond to shifting market conditions and consumer demands. The deployment of digital technologies is essential in optimizing our operational efficiency and enhancing our organizational capabilities, which are crucial for maintaining a competitive position in the market. Our focus on innovation partnerships and strategic management practices underscores the importance of leveraging IT capabilities to drive business transformation and achieve performance excellence. The evolving landscape of digital transformation presents both challenges and opportunities, necessitating a proactive approach to IT governance and resource mobilization to ensure sustained growth and value creation.

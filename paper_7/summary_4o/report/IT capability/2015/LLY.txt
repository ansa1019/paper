The acquisition of Novartis Animal Health has increased our animal health product portfolio, expanded our global commercial presence, and augmented our animal health manufacturing and research and development capabilities. This acquisition has provided us with a greater commercial presence in the companion animal and swine markets, expanded our presence in equine and vaccines areas, and created an entry into the aquaculture market. Our long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on molecules currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We manage research and development spending across our portfolio of molecules, and a delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending. We recognize acquired in-process research and development charges resulting from various collaboration agreements, which are essential for leveraging our technology resources and capabilities. Our research and development expenses increased, driven primarily by higher late-stage clinical development costs, the inclusion of Novartis Animal Health, and an increase in charges associated with the termination of late-stage molecules. We expect revenue growth from established products and new products, which reflects our strategic resource allocation and operational flexibility in response to market dynamics. The integration of our technology capabilities and the optimization of our business processes are critical for enhancing organizational effectiveness and achieving performance gains. Our ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with other resources and capabilities underscores the importance of IT capability in transforming our firm into a competitive force. We face challenges related to the regulatory context and market dynamics that can impact our operational efficiency and resource management. The strategic management of our technology portfolio and the alignment of our business strategy with our operational capabilities are essential for maintaining competitive advantage. We are continuously evaluating our investment choices and the effectiveness of our IT systems to ensure that we meet evolving business needs and directions. The loss of patent exclusivity for key products has resulted in significant revenue declines, highlighting the need for agility and responsiveness in our market strategies. We are aware of the importance of information management capability, which includes providing data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and confidentiality. Our operational processes are designed to support business innovation and transformation, enabling us to adapt to changing consumer demands and competitive pressures. The integration of digital technologies into our operations facilitates the coordination of our assets and internal processes, enhancing our interfirm transactions and relationships. We continuously assess our organizational capabilities and the effectiveness of our IT governance to ensure alignment with our strategic objectives and to optimize our performance outcomes.

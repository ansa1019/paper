The scale and quality of our operating platform, along with the skills of our team, provide unique competitive advantages. Our plan to grow revenue and cash flows is supported by rising rents, as demand for logistics facilities remains strong. We believe that maintaining control over well-positioned land is essential for a successful development program. Our owned and managed land bank is estimated to support the development of over 154 million additional square feet of industrial space, with the carrying value expected to realize value through strategic development and dispositions. The economies of scale from growth in assets under management allow us to increase investments in real estate with minimal increases to general and administrative expenses. The integration of the KTR acquisition was completed with minimal increases in overhead related to property management functions. The operating fundamentals in our markets have improved, positively affecting occupancy and rental rates, which fuels development activity. The key drivers of our net operating income include capital deployment activity within the portfolio, which encompasses acquisitions, development stabilizations, and contributions to co-investment ventures. Our strategic capital segment includes revenue from fees earned for services performed for our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, which fluctuates based on the size of the ventures under management and transactional activity. We manage our business on an owned and managed basis, which affects both our real estate operations and strategic capital segments. The performance of our owned and managed portfolio is consistent with our consolidated portfolio, and we evaluate performance using a "same store" analysis to eliminate the effects of changes in composition. Our general and administrative expenses include costs related to both segments, and we allocate a portion of gross overhead based on the size of respective portfolios. The increase in depreciation and amortization expenses is primarily due to increased investment in real estate properties from acquisitions and completed developments. We recognize net earnings from unconsolidated entities, which are influenced by variances in revenues, expenses, and occupancy rates. Our ability to generate cash is supported by operating activities, distributions from co-investment ventures, and proceeds from property dispositions. We expect to fund cash needs through unrestricted cash balances, property operations, and borrowing capacity under credit facilities. Our debt management includes various arrangements to finance acquisitions and investments, with a focus on maintaining compliance with debt covenants. The performance of our properties is evaluated through metrics such as net operating income and funds from operations, which are crucial for assessing our long-term operational performance. We utilize our defined measures of funds from operations to evaluate performance, budget, and forecast future results, ensuring alignment with our strategic objectives.

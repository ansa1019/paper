We are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products, and services, including information technology and cybersecurity. Our strategy focuses on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of product delivery, and enhancing security capability for our customers. We are committed to investing in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements and in our workforce to ensure we possess the necessary technical skills. The information systems & global solutions (IS&GS) business segment provides advanced technology systems and integrated information technology solutions across a broad spectrum of applications for civil, defense, and intelligence customers. However, IS&GS has been impacted by federal agencies' information technology budget downturns and increased competition, leading to a fragmentation of large contracts into smaller ones awarded primarily on price. We continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet current and future customer needs through independent research and development and selective acquisitions. The acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation aligns with our mission systems and training segment, enhancing our capabilities in the market. Our strategic review of government IT and technical services businesses aims to unlock enterprise value for our stockholders. We anticipate that the divestiture of IS&GS will provide a special cash payment that we plan to use for debt repayment, dividends, or stock repurchases. Our operational environment is characterized by increasing complexity and economic pressures, necessitating a focus on affordability initiatives and operational flexibility. We expect to continue investing in information technology infrastructure to support programs and enhance our enterprise capabilities. Our business segments are organized based on the nature of products and services offered, and we monitor performance through net sales and operating profit. The operating results of our segments reflect the impacts of strategic decisions regarding resource allocation and investment choices. We recognize that our IT capabilities are essential for transforming our firm into a competitive force, enabling us to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources effectively. Our commitment to information management capability ensures we provide data and information to users with the appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and access. We are also focused on enhancing our operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness through process optimization and technology integration. The integration of technology capabilities into our business processes is critical for maintaining competitive advantage and responding to market dynamics. As we navigate the challenges posed by budget constraints and market restructuring, our strategic management practices will continue to emphasize the importance of IT governance and capability development to drive performance improvements and business value.

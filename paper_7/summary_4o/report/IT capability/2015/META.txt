In 2015, we continued to invest across three priorities: our core products and services to better serve our existing communities and businesses, our next generation of services, and our long-term innovation efforts, such as connectivity efforts, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence research. We believe these investments will drive significant overall year-over-year expense growth compared to 2015. Our advertising revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in revenue from ads in news feed on mobile devices, with mobile advertising revenue representing approximately 77% of total advertising revenue in 2015. Factors influencing this growth included an increase in demand for our ad inventory, driven by an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on Facebook, an increase in mobile user growth and engagement, and enhancements in the quality, relevance, and performance of our ads. The average price per ad increased significantly, driven by product changes that increased the prominence of each ad while decreasing the number of ads displayed. We anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future. The increase in research and development expenses in 2015 was primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation and payroll expenses resulting from a growth in employee headcount in engineering and other technical functions. We plan to continue hiring software engineers and other technical employees to support our research and development initiatives. Our cost of revenue increased due to operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure, which are essential for supporting user growth and engagement. We expect that the cost of revenue will increase as we expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user growth and the delivery of new products and services. Our marketing and sales expenses increased significantly, reflecting increases in payroll and benefits expenses due to a rise in employee headcount in our marketing and sales functions. We also plan to increase our investment and hire marketing and sales employees to support our marketing efforts. Our general and administrative expenses increased due to higher payroll and benefits expenses resulting from a growth in employee headcount in general and administrative functions. We anticipate increasing general and administrative employee headcount to support overall company growth. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, and expenses. We believe that our IT capabilities, which encompass the coordination of our assets and internal processes, have become key in transforming our firm into a competitive force. Our IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources to further organizational goals, thereby enhancing our operational efficiency and effectiveness in meeting business needs.

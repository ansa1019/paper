Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. Our operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis, with minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. A key marketing strategy of our insurance businesses is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength, which creates opportunities to negotiate and enter into insurance and reinsurance contracts designed to meet the unique needs of buyers. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to BHRG and General Re. Our insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting in each of the last three years, reflecting the impact of bolt-on business acquisitions and earnings growth in certain operations.

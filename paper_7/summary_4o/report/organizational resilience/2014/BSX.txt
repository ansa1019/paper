In 2014, we generated net sales of $7.380 billion, reflecting an increase despite challenges such as foreign currency fluctuations and the divestiture of our neurovascular business. Our operational flexibility and strategic initiatives allowed us to maintain positive adjustments under these challenging conditions. We undertook various restructuring initiatives to enhance growth potential and align expenses with revenues while preserving investments in research and development. The healthcare industry continues to face political, economic, and regulatory influences that could fundamentally affect our operations, emphasizing the importance of delivering treatments that reduce costs and improve efficiencies. Our investment-grade credit profile reflects the size and diversity of our product portfolio, strong cash flow, and solid financial fundamentals, which are critical for sustaining organizational health and resilience. We believe that our less-invasive products generate favorable clinical outcomes and value, although demonstrating this value may require significant resources and time. Our commitment to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects is essential for maintaining a healthy pipeline of new products that contribute to profitable sales growth. We also recognize the need for adaptability in our business strategy, particularly in emerging markets where we seek to expand our presence and strengthen relationships. The acquisition of the interventional division of Bayer enhances our ability to offer comprehensive solutions for challenging vascular conditions, supporting our strategic response to external pressures. Our restructuring plan is expected to reduce gross annual pre-tax operating expenses significantly, with a substantial portion of the savings reinvested in strategic growth initiatives. We monitor the dynamics of the economy and healthcare industry to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness, which is vital for maintaining performance under pressure. The successful management of our resources, including cash generated from operations, is crucial for funding our infrastructure and legal-related liabilities. We have recorded significant litigation-related charges, which are excluded from our operating performance assessments, reflecting our commitment to managing risks effectively. Our organizational resilience is further supported by our strategic planning and the ability to foresee and confront challenges, ensuring that we can adapt to complex situations and maintain operational continuity. We are committed to enhancing our organizational capabilities through continuous learning and knowledge management, which are essential for thriving in turbulent markets. Our focus on collaboration networks and inter-organizational collaboration strengthens our resilience strategies, enabling us to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and unexpected situations. As we navigate these challenges, we remain dedicated to fostering organizational strength and ensuring long-term sustainability.

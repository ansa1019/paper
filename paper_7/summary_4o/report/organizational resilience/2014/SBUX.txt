Starbucks results for fiscal 2014 demonstrate the continued strength of our global business model and our ability to successfully execute new growth initiatives in a disciplined manner. All reportable segments contributed to strong revenue growth and collectively drove an increase in consolidated operating income and operating margin expansion. The Americas segment continued its strong performance, with revenues growing primarily driven by comparable store sales growth, which was comprised of an increase in average ticket and an increase in the number of transactions. Enhanced food offerings and successful promotional beverages contributed to the growth in comparable store sales. Looking forward, we expect to continue to drive revenue growth and margin expansion through new stores and continued product innovation, targeted at driving growth across all geographies and all dayparts. We plan to continue to expand our beverage platforms and elevate our food program, which will support our organizational health and adaptability in a competitive landscape. The EMEA segment benefited from significant performance improvement, reaching double-digit revenue growth and increased profitability compared to the prior year, driven by favorable foreign currency exchange and comparable store sales growth. Our China/Asia Pacific segment results reflect the growth and strong performance of new stores in the region, including a notable increase in comparable store sales. We expect this segment will become a more significant contributor to overall company profitability in the future. The channel development segment revenues grew, primarily due to increased sales of premium single-serve products, which indicates our operational flexibility and responsiveness to customer needs. We expect this segment to become a more significant contributor to future growth. In fiscal 2015, we expect revenue growth driven by mid-single-digit global comparable store sales growth and the addition of approximately 1,650 net new stores, which will enhance our strategic response to external pressures. We anticipate strong earnings per share growth due in part to an anticipated acquisition-related gain. Our capital expenditures are expected to support ongoing growth initiatives, including new stores and store renovations, which will facilitate our operational continuity and resilience strategies. We actively manage our cash and investments to internally fund operating needs and return cash to shareholders, indicating our commitment to maintaining organizational effectiveness and resource allocation. Our strategic initiatives include expanding our presence in key markets and enhancing our product offerings, which will support our resilience in turbulent markets. The combination of these efforts reflects our focus on organizational transformation and the ability to adapt to complex situations while maintaining performance under pressure. We believe that future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses, ensuring our long-term sustainability and growth.

The competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business. Adverse economic trends have impacted the environment in which we operate, and our customers have been directly affected by these conditions. The significant concentration of our revenue generated in the United States makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in this region. Mastercard continues to monitor political and economic conditions around the world to identify opportunities for growth and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry. The extent and pace of economic recovery in various regions remains uncertain, presenting challenges for Mastercard to grow its business. Our business and our customers' businesses are subject to regulation in many countries, which may impose rules and price controls that could impact our operations. Information security risks for global payments and technology companies have significantly increased, and although we have not experienced material impacts from cyber-attacks, there is no assurance that we will remain immune to these risks. Our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions and the outcome of legal or regulatory proceedings. The company generates revenue and has financial assets in countries at risk for currency devaluation, which could negatively impact our financial results. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities, along with our cash flow generating capabilities, are sufficient to satisfy our future operating cash needs and obligations. The company attempts to manage foreign currency exposures through its foreign exchange risk management activities. Our operating expenses increased primarily due to higher general and administrative expenses, driven by investments to support strategic initiatives. The increase in personnel costs reflects the need to support our strategic initiatives and the growth of our business. Our advertising and marketing strategy aims to increase global brand awareness and facilitate access to new markets. The company’s operational flexibility is supported by its ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations. We continue to evaluate our operational management strategies to ensure resilience in the face of potential disruptions. The company’s ability to foresee and confront sudden disruptive changes is critical for survival and growth, and we are committed to maintaining operational continuity through effective crisis management and preparedness strategies. Our financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by financial institutions or regulatory bodies, and we remain vigilant in assessing risks that could affect our performance under pressure. The company’s strategic initiatives are designed to enhance our resilience and adaptability in a rapidly changing business environment, ensuring that we can respond effectively to both internal and external pressures.

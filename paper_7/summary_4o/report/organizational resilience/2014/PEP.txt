Our management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition, including organizational health, operational flexibility, and performance under pressure. We believe that many challenges create new growth opportunities for our company, including evolving consumer tastes and preferences, which will provide us with opportunities to expand our product offerings and interact with our customers. To address these challenges and capitalize on these opportunities, we intend to strengthen our presence globally, broaden our product portfolio, and adapt to changing customer channels, including increasing our e-commerce presence. We also focus on productivity and lowering the cost base of the company over the long term, utilizing our global scale to eliminate duplication and capitalize on opportunities to lower costs. Our multi-year productivity programs have delivered significant productivity savings, which contribute to our resilience strategies.

The board of directors oversees this integrated risk management framework, ensuring that we maintain effective internal controls and that our operations are resilient in the face of external pressures. We leverage inter-organizational collaboration and strategic tools to enhance our adaptability and organizational effectiveness. 

In 2014, we recognized the need for transformation in our operations, which included restructuring and impairment charges related to our productivity initiatives. These actions are part of our broader strategy to enhance organizational resilience and maintain performance under pressure. We continue to invest in our talent management infrastructure to ensure that we develop the necessary skills for sustainable long-term performance. 

Our commitment to performance with purpose reflects our goal to deliver top-tier financial performance while creating sustainable growth and shareholder value.

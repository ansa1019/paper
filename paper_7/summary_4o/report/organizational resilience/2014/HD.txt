In fiscal 2014, we reported net earnings of $6.3 billion, reflecting a 5.5% increase in net sales to $83.2 billion, driven by positive comparable store sales and increased customer transactions. The results included $33 million of pretax net expenses related to a data breach, which highlighted the importance of maintaining operational integrity under adverse conditions. Our investigation into the data breach revealed that an intruder accessed our systems using a vendor's credentials, emphasizing the need for robust risk management and crisis response strategies. Following the breach, we completed a major payment security project that enhanced our data protection measures, demonstrating our commitment to operational continuity and customer trust. We incurred $63 million in pretax expenses related to the breach, which included costs for identity protection services and legal fees, all of which were expensed as incurred. The ongoing investigation and potential claims from payment card networks underscore the complexities of managing external pressures and the need for effective resource allocation in crisis situations. Our strategic initiatives focused on customer service and product innovation, which are critical for sustaining competitive advantage and adapting to market demands. We also emphasized interconnected retail, enhancing our online and in-store experiences to meet evolving customer needs. This approach is integral to our resilience strategy, allowing us to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and maintain performance under pressure. Our disciplined capital allocation and operational efficiency initiatives further support our resilience, as we aim to generate higher returns on invested capital. The acquisition of HD Supply is expected to enhance our supply chain capabilities, contributing to our organizational strength and adaptability. We believe that our current cash position and access to capital markets will enable us to address obligations arising from the data breach and support our long-term strategic objectives. Our focus on continuous operational improvement and effective crisis management reflects our understanding of the multifaceted nature of organizational resilience. As we navigate future challenges, our commitment to enhancing our operational flexibility and maintaining a strong organizational culture will be pivotal in ensuring our ability to confront adversity and sustain growth. The ongoing evaluation of our risk exposure and the implementation of proactive measures will further reinforce our resilience framework, positioning us to thrive in a dynamic business environment.

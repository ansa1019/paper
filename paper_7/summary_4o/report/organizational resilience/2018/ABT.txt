Abbott's revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements, with significant sales in international markets comprising approximately 65 percent of consolidated net sales. Over the last several years, Abbott proactively shaped the company with the strategic intent to deliver sustainable growth in all of its businesses. The acquisition of St. Jude Medical and Alere provided expanded opportunities for future growth and is an important part of the company's effort to develop a strong, diverse portfolio. The combined business competes in nearly every area of the $30 billion global cardiovascular device market, as well as in neuromodulation. The sales increase over the last three years reflects both the 2017 acquisitions and volume growth across Abbott's businesses, most notably in established pharmaceuticals, diabetes care, and diagnostics. Abbott's operating margin was positively impacted by margin improvements across various businesses, partially offset by higher amortization and other costs associated with the acquisitions. The company focuses on driving market adoption and geographic expansion of its Alinity suite of diagnostics instruments and continues to enhance its portfolio with the introduction of several new science-based products. The established pharmaceutical products segment focuses on the sale of its products in emerging markets, with significant sales growth driven by double-digit growth in India and China. Abbott's research and development expenditures are aimed at enhancing its capabilities, with a focus on developing next-generation technologies in various therapeutic areas. The company has committed to reducing its debt levels and has made significant repayments, reflecting a strategic response to enhance financial resilience. The integration of St. Jude Medical and Alere involved restructuring plans to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs, demonstrating operational flexibility and adaptability in response to market dynamics. Abbott's strategic initiatives include continued investment in product development areas that provide opportunities for strong sustainable growth. The company monitors the creditworthiness of customers and establishes allowances against trade receivables to mitigate credit risk, reflecting a proactive approach to resource management. Abbott's focus on driving growth globally and enhancing its operational capabilities underscores its commitment to organizational resilience in the face of external pressures and market volatility. The companyâ€™s ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is evident in its strategic planning and operational management practices, which prioritize innovation and adaptability in a rapidly changing business environment.

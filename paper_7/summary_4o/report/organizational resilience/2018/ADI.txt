In fiscal 2018, we recorded special charges of $44.5 million as a result of our decision to consolidate certain wafer and test facility operations acquired as part of the acquisition. We intend to transfer production to our other internal facilities and to external foundries, which reflects our strategic response to operational challenges. The increase in operating income in fiscal 2018 was the result of a $1.2 billion increase in gross margin, partially offset by increased research and development expenses and amortization expenses related to the acquisition. Our commitment to research and development is essential to maintain product leadership and to provide innovative new product offerings, which are critical to our future growth and adaptability in a competitive landscape. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to fund operations and capital expenditures, indicating our operational flexibility and resilience in managing financial resources. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2018 was primarily a result of higher net income adjusted for non-cash items and changes in working capital, which reflects our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite challenges. We continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency, which is indicative of our proactive measures to enhance organizational health and resilience. The sales increase in various geographic regions was primarily a result of the acquisition and an increase in demand for our products, demonstrating our capacity to respond effectively to external pressures and market demands. Our strategic initiatives include the development of innovative technologies and processes, which are essential for maintaining competitive advantage and ensuring organizational success. The adjustments made in response to changes in market conditions and operational demands illustrate our organizational agility and ability to confront unexpected situations. We monitor global macroeconomic conditions and have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years, reflecting our commitment to organizational transformation and resilience strategies. The increase in gross margin percentage in fiscal 2018 was a result of a mix shift in favor of higher margin products, which is a strategic response to enhance profitability and operational sustainability. Our approach to managing risks and uncertainties, including the assessment of future market conditions and operational performance, underscores our focus on organizational capabilities and resilience. The ongoing evaluation of our long-lived assets for impairment and the assessment of goodwill for potential impairment indicate our commitment to maintaining organizational integrity and performance amidst environmental disruptions. We have undertaken significant investments in research and development to foster innovation and adaptability, which are critical for thriving in turbulent markets. Our operational management strategies, including resource allocation and crisis management, are designed to ensure continuity and resilience in the face of adversity, thereby supporting our long-term objectives and organizational evolution.

Given the multiple-year duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments, if membership acquisition and retention do not meet expectations, margins may be adversely impacted. The long-term and fixed cost nature of content commitments may limit flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the business and market segments. If original programming does not meet expectations, particularly in terms of costs, viewing, and popularity, the business, including brand and results of operations, may be adversely affected. The need to adapt to varied content offerings, consumer customs, and differing legal and regulatory environments is critical as operations expand internationally. As the international offering evolves, managing and adjusting the business to address these complexities is essential for maintaining operational continuity. The ability to manage change and growth is vital, as failure to do so could adversely affect the business. 

The company faces risks associated with unforeseen costs and potential liabilities in connection with content acquired, produced, licensed, and distributed. If the company does not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, business performance may suffer. The ability to provide members with content depends on licensing rights from studios and content providers, which may be adversely affected if these entities are unwilling to license content on acceptable terms. As competition increases, programming costs may rise, impacting the ability to maintain a compelling mix of content necessary for membership acquisition and retention. 

The company is also subject to economic, political, regulatory, and other risks arising from international operations, which require significant resources and management attention. Difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws and regulations may disrupt service availability. The need to manage various risks, including compliance with laws such as anti-corruption regulations and foreign intellectual property laws, is crucial for operational resilience. 

Cybersecurity threats pose significant risks, as disruptions could result in loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data, or theft of intellectual property. The reliability and security of computer systems are essential for attracting and retaining members. Any significant disruption could result in a loss of memberships and adversely affect business results. 

The company relies on a combination of proprietary and third-party technology to operate its business. If technology fails or does not operate as expected, business operations could be adversely impacted. The ability to efficiently deliver streaming content is contingent upon the performance of third-party service providers, and any issues could hinder the ability to meet customer needs. 

Maintaining a positive reputation concerning service and content is vital for attracting and retaining members. If content is perceived as low quality or offensive, it may adversely impact the company's reputation and operational success. The company must navigate the complexities of maintaining effective marketing strategies while managing costs and member expectations. 

Overall, the ability to adapt to changing conditions, manage risks, and maintain operational flexibility is critical for the company's resilience and long-term success in a competitive and dynamic market.

The objectives of our management's discussion and analysis are to provide users of our consolidated financial statements with a narrative explanation from the perspective of management regarding our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, and certain factors that may affect future results. Our un-carrier strategy has disrupted the wireless communication services industry by listening to our customers and providing them with added value and an exceptional experience, which includes implementing initiatives that address significant pain points for customers. Our ability to acquire and retain branded customers is important to our business in generating revenues, and we believe our strategy, along with ongoing network improvements, has been successful in attracting and retaining customers. The proposed merger with Sprint is expected to enable rapid launch of a nationwide 5G network, accelerate innovation, and increase competition in the U.S. wireless, video, and broadband industries. We recognize costs related to hurricanes, including incremental costs to maintain services, and have received reimbursement payments from insurance carriers related to these events. Our financial performance has been impacted by various factors, including the positive impacts from the adoption of new revenue standards and insurance reimbursements related to hurricanes. Adjusted EBITDA increased primarily due to higher service revenues and lower losses on equipment, alongside the positive impact of insurance reimbursements. Our liquidity requirements have been driven by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses and the construction, expansion, and upgrading of our network infrastructure, which is essential for maintaining operational continuity and adapting to market demands. We expect cash purchases of property and equipment to be significant as we continue to deploy low-band spectrum and lay the groundwork for 5G. The increase in cash purchases is primarily due to growth in network build-out. We maintain a focus on strategic initiatives that enhance our operational flexibility and resilience in the face of external pressures. Our management regularly reviews and updates projections for changes in financial and operating results, competitive landscape, and other factors that may influence our performance. The ongoing development of our organizational capabilities, including the integration of new technologies and strategic partnerships, is crucial for sustaining growth and adapting to environmental disruptions. We have established mechanisms for risk management and crisis response, ensuring that we can effectively confront unexpected situations and maintain performance under pressure. Our commitment to organizational learning and knowledge management supports our ability to innovate and respond to changing customer needs, thereby enhancing our competitive advantage in a turbulent market. The strategic planning and resource allocation processes we employ are designed to optimize our operational effectiveness and ensure that we are well-positioned to navigate complex situations and achieve our major objectives.

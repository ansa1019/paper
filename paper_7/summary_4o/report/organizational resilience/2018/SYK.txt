Our goal is to achieve sales growth at the high-end of the medical technology (medtech) industry and maintain our capital allocation strategy that prioritizes acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases. We reported net earnings of $3,553 and net earnings per diluted share of $9.34. We continued our capital allocation strategy by investing in acquisitions, which reflects our commitment to resource allocation and operational flexibility. The acquisition of K2M Group Holdings, Inc. and Entellus Medical, Inc. demonstrates our strategy to enhance our capabilities and adapt to market demands. Our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates. Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures, which is essential for maintaining operational continuity under challenging conditions. We supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund our activities as necessary, reflecting our strategic response to resource needs and market pressures. We believe our financial condition continues to be strong, enabling us to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs from various sources, including cash from operations and existing credit lines. Our overall cash position reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that considers liquidity management, economic factors, and tax considerations. We have existing credit facilities should additional funds be required, which enhances our organizational resilience in the face of potential disruptions. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to increased payments for acquisitions, indicating our proactive measures to enhance our competitive advantage and adapt to market changes. Our strategic initiatives focus on leveraging our operational resources and capabilities to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations. We maintain a strong investment-grade short-term and long-term debt ratings, which we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as needed. Our assessments regarding business plans, tax planning opportunities, and expectations about future outcomes reflect our organizational foresight and resilience strategies. We are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions, and claims arising in the normal course of business, which could impact our financial position and operational effectiveness. The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods, highlighting the importance of our crisis management and risk assessment capabilities. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions, and while the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Our ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change is crucial for our survival and growth in a turbulent market environment.

During 2022, following the completion of our merger with IHS Markit, we reorganized our reportable segments, which reflects our adaptability and strategic response to changing market conditions. The merger with IHS Markit, a world leader in critical information, analytics, and solutions for major industries, enhances our operational flexibility and positions us to better serve and power the markets of the future. Our strategy focuses on delivering an exceptional customer experience by enhancing foundational capabilities, evolving core businesses, and pursuing growth via adjacencies, which aligns with our commitment to organizational resilience. We aim to meet or exceed organic revenue growth and EBITDA margin targets while realizing merger integration commitments, which are critical for maintaining operational continuity and performance under pressure. 

The integration of our businesses and the focus on enhancing customer support reflect our future orientation and resilience strategies. We continue to invest in customer-facing solutions and processes to ensure we meet evolving customer needs and adapt to external pressures. Our commitment to risk management, compliance, and control across S&P Global is essential for sustaining organizational health and effectiveness. 

The operational performance in 2022, including a significant increase in revenue and operating profit, demonstrates our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adverse conditions. The increase in subscription revenue, driven by the merger and continued demand for market data, illustrates our capacity for resource generation and strategic adaptation in response to market volatility. 

Our focus on innovation and service enhancement, particularly in the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) space, indicates our proactive measures to confront complex situations and leverage opportunities for growth. The operational management of our diverse business segments, including market intelligence, ratings, and commodity insights, showcases our organizational capabilities and the importance of inter-organizational collaboration in achieving major objectives.

We also recognize the impact of external disturbances, such as economic fluctuations and regulatory changes, on our operations. Our strategic initiatives are designed to mitigate risks associated with these disturbances while fostering a culture of learning and adaptation. The establishment of a data council to drive enterprise value creation reflects our commitment to knowledge management and operational excellence.

Overall, our financial position remains strong, supported by effective resource allocation and a commitment to sustainability. The anticipated divestiture of our engineering solutions business aligns with our strategic focus on core competencies and enhances our ability to navigate future challenges. The emphasis on continuous improvement and stakeholder engagement underpins our resilience and adaptability in a turbulent business environment.

PepsiCo faced many of the same challenges in 2022 as its consumers, customers, and competitors, including supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, shifting consumer preferences, and a worsening climate crisis. To meet these challenges, the company is driven by an approach called pep+ (PepsiCo Positive), which is a strategic end-to-end transformation of its business, focusing on sustainability and human capital. This transformation aims to create growth and value by operating within planetary boundaries and inspiring positive change. The company is working to build a circular and inclusive value chain through actions to achieve net-zero emissions and become net water positive, while also introducing more sustainable packaging. The ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly due to the conflict in Ukraine, has resulted in significant operational challenges, including supply chain disruptions and increased costs. The board of directors oversees PepsiCo's integrated risk management framework, which includes assessing risks related to cybersecurity, food safety, sustainability, and supply chain inflation. The board receives updates on various enterprise risk management issues and dedicates meetings to discussing specific risk topics, including the impact of disruptive events such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and COVID-19. The company continues to monitor existing and proposed laws and regulations to mitigate potential unfavorable impacts on its operations. PepsiCo's risk management framework is designed to identify, assess, prioritize, and address top strategic, financial, and operational risks, fostering a corporate culture of integrity and risk awareness. The achievement of strategic and operating objectives involves risks that evolve over time, and the company leverages an integrated risk management framework to manage these risks effectively. The board evaluates top risks considering both internal and external environments, which aids in prioritizing risk mitigation efforts. The company’s operations are impacted by various external factors, including climate change and international market conditions, which necessitate ongoing adaptation and resilience strategies. The board has tasked designated committees with oversight of specific categories of risk management, ensuring comprehensive coverage of sustainability, diversity, and public policy matters. The company’s commitment to resilience is reflected in its proactive measures to address market risks, including commodity price fluctuations and foreign exchange rates. PepsiCo's operations are also influenced by the evolving retail landscape, necessitating the identification of actions to build global e-commerce and digital capabilities. The company continues to adapt its business models to meet changing consumer behaviors and preferences, demonstrating operational flexibility and a commitment to long-term sustainable growth.

The company's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, maximizing the benefits of the Allergan acquisition, and ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. Following the closing of the Allergan acquisition in 2020, AbbVie implemented an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization, realizing $2.5 billion of annual cost synergies in 2022. In response to the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, AbbVie announced the suspension of operations for all aesthetics products in Russia while ensuring the sale of essential pharmaceutical products to maintain an uninterrupted supply of medicines.

AbbVie’s financial performance in 2022 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $58.1 billion, indicating robust operational effectiveness.

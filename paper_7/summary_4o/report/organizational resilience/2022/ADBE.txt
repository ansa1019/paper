In response to the Russia-Ukraine war, we announced a halt of all new sales of our products and services in Russia and Belarus, which resulted in a reduction of our digital media annual recurring revenue (ARR) by $75 million, reflecting our adaptability to external pressures and the need for strategic response mechanisms in the face of disruptive events. While we continued to provide digital media services in Ukraine, we also reduced our digital media ARR balance by an additional $12 million, demonstrating our operational flexibility and commitment to maintaining customer relationships during unexpected situations. Our success in driving growth in ARR has positively affected our revenue growth, indicating a strong organizational capability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity. We believe that investments in research and development are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to the timely development of new and enhanced offerings and solutions, which are essential for organizational resilience. Our digital media segment provides products, services, and solutions that enable individuals, teams, and enterprises to create, publish, and promote their content anywhere, which is vital for maintaining operational continuity and enhancing organizational effectiveness. The integration of our digital media and digital experience businesses allows us to efficiently manage customer journeys and deliver personalized experiences at scale, thereby strengthening our competitive advantage and fostering organizational health. We continuously monitor the direct and indirect impacts of macroeconomic conditions, including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and geopolitical events, on our business and financial results, which is crucial for our strategic foresight and risk assessment capabilities. Our subscription-based business model provides a relatively predictable revenue stream, which contributes to our resilience strategies by allowing us to adjust to market volatility and maintain performance under pressure. The increase in subscription revenue across our offerings reflects our ability to innovate and adapt to changing customer needs, reinforcing our organizational strength. We categorize our products into reportable segments that address diverse market opportunities, allowing us to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform our offerings to emerge stronger from challenging situations. Our approach to acquisitions, such as the integration of Frame.io and Workfront, demonstrates our commitment to resource generation and strategic initiatives that enhance our operational management and future planning capabilities. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and investment balances, along with anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, ensuring our resilience in the face of resource constraints. The ongoing investments in our digital experience solutions and the expansion of our market presence are designed to optimize customer journeys and drive new customer acquisition, which are essential for sustaining growth and organizational evolution.

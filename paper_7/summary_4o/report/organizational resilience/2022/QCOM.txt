Our business and operating segments are organized on the basis of products and services, which allows us to adapt to fluctuations in demand and maintain operational flexibility. We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing our intellectual property, including patents and other rights. The fluctuations in revenues are influenced by consumer demand for devices and the timing of customer/device launches, which highlights our capability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions. We have experienced significant increases in revenues, particularly in our QCT segment, driven by higher average selling prices and a favorable mix toward higher-tier 5G products, demonstrating our ability to innovate and adapt in response to market demands. 

In fiscal 2022, we recorded a substantial benefit from the annulment of a fine, which reflects our resilience in navigating regulatory challenges and our strategic response to external pressures. Our strategic investments, including acquisitions, are designed to enhance our organizational capabilities and ensure long-term growth. We anticipate continued consumer demand for 5G products and services, which necessitates maintaining a competitive advantage through innovation and effective resource allocation.

We remain vigilant regarding macroeconomic conditions that may impact consumer demand, indicating our awareness of external disturbances and our preparedness to confront potential challenges. The ongoing development of our technologies and the transition to new wireless standards are critical to sustaining our organizational health and performance under pressure. Our commitment to research and development is evident in the increase of expenditures aimed at enhancing our technological capabilities, which is essential for maintaining operational continuity and adapting to future market needs.

The anticipated impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and other environmental perturbations necessitate a proactive approach to risk management and resource generation. We continue to engage with stakeholders and industry participants to promote our licensing programs, which are integral to fostering a competitive and innovative business environment. Our financial strategies, including liquidity management and capital return programs, are structured to support resilience against economic fluctuations and ensure we can respond effectively to unforeseen circumstances.

We recognize the importance of organizational learning and knowledge management in enhancing our adaptability and performance. The complexities of our operational environment require us to maintain a multifaceted approach to resilience, encompassing strategic foresight, collaboration networks, and effective decision-making processes. As we navigate through turbulent markets and evolving consumer demands, our focus on operational management and strategic adaptation will be vital for our organizational survival and success.

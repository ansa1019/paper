The global economy continued to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, many countries and regions, including the United States, showed signs of slowing economic activity, potentially indicating the early stages of a recession. Economic activity began to be adversely impacted by the effects of monetary and fiscal policy tightening as years of fiscal stimulus from governments and accommodative monetary policy from global central banks began to wane. Despite various economic headwinds, several key economic indicators in the U.S., including employment, have demonstrated resilience. The growth in economic activity and demand for goods and services, alongside supply chain complications, contributed to significant inflationary pressures. Various supply bottlenecks contributed to inflationary pressure throughout much of 2022. Labor disputes, shortages of material and skilled labor, work stoppages, and increasing labor costs can also adversely impact the organization and the assets managed. The actions taken by Russia in Ukraine starting in February 2022 have caused volatility in the commodities markets, which can impact financial performance and operational flexibility. The Russia-Ukraine conflict, including the sanctions imposed in response to Russia's invasion, has exacerbated and may further exacerbate these issues and trends globally, including by increasing oil and gas prices and price volatility. The economic conditions have led to substantial market volatility, equity and credit market declines, and increased pressures on labor supply. The organization must adapt to these external pressures while maintaining operational continuity and resilience strategies.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with risk factors, our consolidated financial statements, and related notes. Our company has expanded to several computationally intensive fields, leveraging its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, and other applications. Our supply chain conditions and complexity of products have grown significantly, leading to inventory provisions for excess inventory and purchase obligations totaling $2.17 billion in fiscal year 2023. Product transitions are complex, and we have managed prior transitions, but these may not continue as expected. We build technology for use cases that may be new or may not yet exist, which can create volatility in revenue or supply levels. The management of new license requirements impacting exports to China and Russia is complicated and time-consuming, and our results may be harmed if customers do not want to purchase alternative products or if we incur significant transition costs. COVID-19-related disruptions have created supply chain and logistics constraints, and challenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced in the future. We have engaged with customers in China to provide alternative products not subject to new license requirements. Our revenue from sales to customers outside the United States accounted for 69% of total revenue for fiscal year 2023, with a decline primarily driven by China and Taiwan. The overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions was an unfavorable impact of 7.5% in fiscal year 2023. As a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand, which requires management judgment. Situations resulting in excess or obsolete inventory may include changes in business and economic conditions and sudden decreases in demand. Our liquidity is primarily derived from cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, with sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources to ensure we can finance future capital requirements. The adverse cash flow impact of mandatory capitalization of research and development expenditures will be reduced in future years. We returned $10.04 billion in share repurchases and $398 million in cash dividends during fiscal year 2023. Our management has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee, which has reviewed our disclosures. The increase in research and development expenses was driven by increased compensation, employee growth, and engineering development costs. Our results and competitive position may be harmed if customers do not want to purchase our alternative product offerings or if we incur significant transition costs. The preparation of financial statements requires estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts, and we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit. We have unrecognized tax benefits recorded in non-current income tax payable, and uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions may affect the timing of potential tax liabilities.

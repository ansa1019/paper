In 2022, we experienced limited disruptions during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which reflects our ability to maintain operational continuity despite external pressures. We took several major steps that scaled and reshaped our business, including strategic acquisitions that expanded our technology and product portfolio, thereby enhancing our organizational capabilities and adaptability in a challenging market environment. The acquisition of Xilinx, Inc. allowed us to access new markets and customers, further diversifying our business model and strengthening our competitive advantage. Our financial results demonstrate resilience, with net revenue increasing by 44% compared to 2021, driven by significant growth in our data center segment, which saw a 64% increase in revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC server processors. Despite facing a 10% decrease in client segment revenue due to a weak PC market, our overall performance reflects effective resource allocation and strategic initiatives that support our operational flexibility. We also expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, which positions us to provide a broader set of leadership compute engines and accelerators, thereby enhancing our ability to respond to evolving customer needs and market demands. Our product technology roadmap continued to be executed successfully, with the launch of new leadership products designed to optimize performance across various market segments. The increase in research and development expenses indicates our commitment to innovation and the development of adaptive strategies that respond to environmental disruptions. We believe our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, along with our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, will be sufficient to fund operations and support strategic planning over the next 12 months and beyond. Our operational management practices, including monitoring supplier relationships and adjusting to market conditions, demonstrate our proactive measures in risk management and resource utilization. The establishment of a new commercial paper program and the issuance of senior notes reflect our strategic response to financial needs while maintaining liquidity. Our ability to foresee and confront challenges, as evidenced by our financial performance and strategic acquisitions, underscores our organizational resilience and commitment to thriving in a complex and turbulent business environment.

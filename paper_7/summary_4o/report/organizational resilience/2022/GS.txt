In this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations, we emphasize the importance of our business continuity planning (BCP), information security program, risk management, and liquidity policies, which are critical for maintaining operational resilience. Our resilience framework defines the fundamental principles for BCP and crisis management to ensure that critical functions can continue to operate in the event of a disruption. We monitor threats and assess risks to ensure our state of readiness in the event of a significant operational disruption to the normal operations of our critical functions or their dependencies. Our business continuity program is comprehensive and consistent on a firmwide basis, incorporating new information, including updated resilience capabilities as they become available. We conduct regular testing of response and recovery strategies to minimize and prevent significant operational disruptions. 

Our risk management framework employs a comprehensive, integrated approach to identify, assess, monitor, and manage the risks we assume in conducting our activities. This includes a focus on operational risk, which encompasses risks arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or external events. We have established a governance structure that includes the firmwide operational risk and resilience committee, which is responsible for overseeing operational risk and ensuring business resilience. 

We also recognize the impact of external pressures, such as macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns, on our operational flexibility and adaptability. The global economy has been affected by persistent broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns, which contribute to increased market volatility and uncertainty. Our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity is reflected in our strategic initiatives and resource allocation strategies. 

Our capital management policy provides a framework to maintain an appropriate level and composition of capital in both business-as-usual and stressed conditions, ensuring that we can respond effectively to environmental disruptions. We conduct stress tests to quantify our exposure to tail risks and highlight potential loss concentrations, which aids in our ability to adapt to unexpected situations. 

The firmwide risk appetite committee is responsible for approving and monitoring risk frameworks, policies, and parameters related to our core risk management processes, including limits and thresholds at firmwide, business, and product levels. We apply a rigorous framework of limits and thresholds to control and monitor risk across transactions, products, businesses, and markets. 

We have established a contingency funding plan that outlines our potential responses in a liquidity crisis, including pre-funding for estimated cash and collateral needs. Our liquidity risk management policies are designed to ensure we have sufficient financing, even when funding markets experience persistent stress. We maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets. 

Our operational resilience is further supported by our comprehensive risk management framework, which includes the identification and assessment of operational risks, monitoring compliance with established risk limits, and utilizing risk mitigants to reduce exposures. This multifaceted approach enables us to confront challenges and maintain organizational health and performance under pressure.

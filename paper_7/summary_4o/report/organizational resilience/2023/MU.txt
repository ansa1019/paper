The memory and storage industry environment deteriorated sharply in the fourth quarter of 2022 and throughout 2023 due to weak demand in many end markets combined with global and macroeconomic challenges. This led to significant reductions in average selling prices and declines in revenue across all business segments. In response to these challenging conditions, we recognized charges to write down inventories and took significant steps to reduce costs and operating expenses, including a restructure plan that involved a headcount reduction of approximately 15%. The 2023 restructure plan was substantially completed and is expected to realize cost savings of approximately $130 million per quarter. We initiated this plan to adapt to the pressures of the current market environment and to maintain operational flexibility. The impact of the China Cyberspace Administration's decision has created uncertainty regarding our revenue opportunities in China, which we are working to mitigate over time. Despite these challenges, we are focused on managing down our inventories and controlling our supply, which reflects our commitment to resilience strategies and operational continuity. We expect wafer starts to remain significantly below peak capacity levels as we navigate through these adverse conditions. Our long-term goal is to retain market share in the DRAM and NAND sectors, which requires us to adapt our strategies in response to external pressures. We are also advancing our global back-end assembly and test network to support our product portfolio and extend our ability to deliver on global customer demand. This includes investments in new facilities in China and India to address future demand. Our board of directors has authorized a discretionary repurchase of up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock, reflecting our strategic response to current market conditions and our commitment to maintaining organizational strength. We continuously evaluate alternatives for efficiently funding our capital expenditures and ongoing operations, which is critical for sustaining our operational capabilities. We expect our cash and investments, cash flows from operations, and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. The need for strategic foresight is underscored by our commitment to invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities, and research and development to achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality. We recognize the importance of resilience in our operational management and strategic planning processes, particularly as we confront the complexities of the current business environment. The anticipated construction of new leading-edge memory manufacturing fabs in the United States is contingent on support through government incentives, which reflects our proactive measures to ensure future growth and adaptability in a turbulent market.

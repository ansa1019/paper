In fiscal 2023, we delivered strong results with growth in revenue and profitability, focusing on delivering innovation across our technologies to assist our customers in executing their digital transformations. We took multiple actions to mitigate component shortages and address supply constraints seen industry-wide, which resulted in significant increased costs and extended lead times. These mitigating actions included partnering with key suppliers, modifying product designs to leverage alternate suppliers, and optimizing inventory build and customer delivery plans. We believe these actions have helped us optimize access to critical components and meet customer demand despite previous supply constraints. Our strategy emphasizes securely connecting everything, driving a trusted customer experience through innovation, solutions, and strategic initiatives. We continue to operate in a challenging macroeconomic and competitive environment, where we aggressively invest in priority areas to drive profitable growth over the long term. The overall environment remains uncertain, but we are committed to adapting our business model to enhance operational flexibility and resilience. We experienced product revenue growth across various customer markets, driven by strong demand in secure, agile networks and end-to-end security, while also addressing declines in collaboration products. Our gross margin increased, primarily due to favorable pricing and product mix, although productivity challenges persist. We recognize the importance of maintaining operational continuity and flexibility in response to external pressures and environmental disruptions. Our ongoing assessment of supply chain management and inventory levels reflects our commitment to resilience and adaptability in meeting customer needs. We have increased our investments in research and development to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely manner, which is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and organizational effectiveness. The restructuring plan announced in fiscal 2023 aims to rebalance the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas, reflecting our focus on strategic adaptation and resource allocation. We are also committed to enhancing our organizational capabilities and fostering inter-organizational collaboration to navigate complex situations and ensure long-term sustainability. Our financial position remains strong, with significant cash reserves that allow us to invest in strategic initiatives and respond to future challenges effectively. The increase in deferred revenue indicates a robust pipeline and reflects our ability to absorb strain while maintaining performance under pressure. We continue to evaluate our exposure to risks and uncertainties, ensuring that our operational practices align with our major objectives of growth and resilience in a turbulent market environment.

In this section, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including a discussion of our results of operations for 2019 compared to 2018, an analysis of changes in our financial condition, and a discussion of our contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements. We executed our product roadmap and introduced a number of high-performance products in 2019, which reflects our ability to adapt and respond effectively to market demands. Our operating results tend to vary seasonally, indicating a need for operational flexibility and strategic initiatives to maintain performance under pressure. We believe our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balance, along with our secured revolving facility, will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, over the next 12 months, demonstrating our preparedness for future challenges. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, and goodwill impairments, which reflects our commitment to organizational health and resilience in the face of uncertainties. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher sales, partially offset by increased operating expenses, showcasing our ability to reconfigure resources effectively. We recognize revenue upon the shipment of the product to our distributors, which requires us to maintain a robust understanding of market conditions and customer needs to ensure business continuity. Our financial performance is based on two reportable segments, and we expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales, highlighting our adaptability in a global market. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts, reflecting our organizational capabilities in risk assessment and management. We perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year, indicating our proactive measures in maintaining organizational integrity and performance. Our aggregate principal debt obligations were reduced significantly, which enhances our financial resilience and ability to confront future pressures. The expected timing of payments of our obligations is estimated based on current information, and we recognize the need to adjust our strategies based on changing conditions, which is essential for organizational survival. The licensing gain recognized during 2019 and the improvements in our balance sheet illustrate our strategic response to market opportunities and challenges. Our operating activities provided significant net cash, driven by changes in working capital, which underscores our operational management and resource generation capabilities. Overall, our financial condition reflects a trajectory of resilience, with a focus on maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions while positioning ourselves for future growth and sustainability.

Mastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses, and other organizations worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks. Our payment solutions offer customers choice and flexibility and are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments system. In 2019, we generated net cash flows from operations of $8.2 billion, reflecting our operational effectiveness and ability to maintain performance under pressure. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities balances, along with our cash flow generating capabilities, are sufficient to satisfy our future operating cash needs, capital asset purchases, and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations and potential obligations. Our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions, which highlights the importance of risk management and operational continuity in maintaining organizational resilience. We rely on existing liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations, credit and settlement exposure, and investments in our business. The risk of loss on guarantees related to transactions between our customers is specific to individual customers but may also be driven by regional or global economic conditions, emphasizing the need for effective crisis management and adaptability to external pressures. Our strategic initiatives include investments in technology and innovation, which are crucial for enhancing our competitive advantage and ensuring business continuity. The effective income tax rate for 2019 was lower than the previous year, primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of earnings and discrete tax benefits, which contribute to our organizational health and financial resilience. Our operational flexibility is demonstrated by our ability to respond to environmental disruptions and transform our operations to emerge stronger from challenging situations. We manage foreign currency balance sheet remeasurement and transactional currency exposure through our foreign exchange risk management activities, which are essential for maintaining system integrity and performance. The impact of foreign exchange activity has not been eliminated in our currency-neutral results, indicating our awareness of the complexities involved in global operations. We continue to operate and serve our Venezuelan issuers, acquirers, merchants, and account holders with our products and services despite the challenges posed by currency devaluation and exchange control regulations. Our ability to foresee and confront sudden disruptive changes is reflected in our strategic planning and operational management practices. The components of our net revenue growth were driven by gross dollar volume growth, cross-border growth, and switched transaction growth, which are indicative of our resilience strategies in adapting to market demands. Overall, our performance maintenance and organizational effectiveness are supported by a multifaceted approach to managing risks and leveraging opportunities in a turbulent business environment.

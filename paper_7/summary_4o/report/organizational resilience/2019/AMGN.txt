Amgen is a biotechnology company committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses, focusing on innovative medicines that have the potential to be first-in-class molecules and that have a large-effect size on serious diseases. Our strategy includes integrated activities intended to maintain and strengthen our competitive position in the industry, which involves advancing our innovative pipeline and expanding our manufacturing capabilities. We have continued to invest in external opportunities to augment our internal programs and products, including collaborations to enhance our human genetics capabilities, which allow us to identify new development targets. We devote considerable resources to research and development activities, but successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain and we face increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy both before and after product launches. Rising healthcare costs and economic conditions continue to pose challenges to our business, including significant pricing pressures and other cost containment measures. Our long-term success depends on our ability to continue to discover, develop, and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. We must develop new products to achieve revenue growth and to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity or when competing products are launched. We are engaged in litigation regarding patents and face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics, which may impact our sales and market position. Our operations are subject to various risks, including those related to legal proceedings and government investigations, which may have outcomes that are difficult to predict. We evaluate developments in these legal proceedings quarterly, as adverse determinations could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. We have a significant focus on maintaining operational flexibility and adaptability in response to external pressures and disruptions, which is essential for sustaining our organizational health and effectiveness. Our financial condition is supported by substantial cash flows from operating activities, which enable us to invest in our business while returning capital to shareholders. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities and access to financing. We have established a commercial paper program and a revolving credit agreement to support our working capital needs, reflecting our proactive measures to ensure financial resilience. Our investment policy is designed to maintain safety of principal and prudent levels of liquidity, which is crucial for navigating the complexities of the biotechnology landscape. We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations, and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital, capital expenditures, and strategic initiatives. We continuously assess our operational resources and capabilities to ensure we can respond effectively to environmental disruptions and maintain our competitive advantage in a turbulent market.

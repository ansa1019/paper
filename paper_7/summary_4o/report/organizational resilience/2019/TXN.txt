We design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. For many years, we have run our business with three overarching ambitions in mind: to act like owners who will own the company for decades, to adapt and succeed in a world that is ever changing, and to be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of. Our business model is designed around sustainable competitive advantages, including a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology, a broad portfolio of differentiated products, extensive market channels, and the diversity and longevity of our products and customer positions. We invest in manufacturing technologies and do most of our manufacturing in-house, allowing us to ensure a consistent supply of products and invest in technology that differentiates our offerings. Our strategic focus is on analog and embedded processing, particularly in the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best growth opportunities due to increasing semiconductor content. This focus provides long product life cycles, intrinsic diversity, and less capital-intensive manufacturing, contributing to stability, profitability, and strong cash generation. We believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our strategy emphasizes returning all free cash flow to shareholders, which underscores our commitment to maximizing shareholder value over the long term. The combined effect of our ambitions, business model, and sustainable competitive advantages has allowed us to build a stronger company over time, gaining market share and returning all free cash flow to our owners. Our segments represent groups of similar products combined based on design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes, and distribution channels, reflecting our resource allocation and operational flexibility. We recognize that changes in customer demand can significantly impact our revenue and profit margins, highlighting the importance of adaptability in our operations. Our focus on maintaining a strong cash flow from operations and managing our capital expenditures demonstrates our commitment to resilience in the face of market fluctuations. Additionally, our diverse product portfolio reduces dependency on any single product, customer, technology, or market, further enhancing our organizational resilience. We believe that our ability to foresee and respond to environmental disruptions is critical for our survival and growth, allowing us to flourish even in challenging conditions. Our operational management strategies are designed to ensure performance maintenance and effective resource deployment, which are essential for navigating complex situations and external pressures. We continuously assess our operational resources and capabilities to adapt to changing market dynamics, ensuring that we can confront adversity and leverage opportunities for transformation and growth.

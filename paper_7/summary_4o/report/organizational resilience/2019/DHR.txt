The company faces a variety of opportunities and challenges, including rapid technological development in most of its served markets, which necessitates operational flexibility and adaptability to maintain performance under pressure. The company is making significant investments to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development, and customer-facing resources. Danaher’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future, which reflects an emphasis on strategic initiatives and future planning.

The anticipated acquisition of the GE Biopharma business is expected to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities, enhancing the company’s product line diversity and service innovation capabilities.

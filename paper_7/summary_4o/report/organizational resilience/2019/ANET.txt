Our cloud networking solutions deliver industry-leading performance, scalability, availability, programmability, automation, and visibility, which are essential for maintaining operational continuity under challenging conditions. The programmability of our EOS software has allowed us to rapidly integrate with a wide range of third-party applications, enhancing our adaptability to environmental perturbations and customer needs. We believe our future success is dependent upon our ability to continue to develop market-leading products and features that address the needs of our end customers, which is a critical aspect of our resilience strategy. We have experienced unpredictability in the timing of orders from large end customers, primarily due to changes in demand patterns, indicating the necessity for operational flexibility and effective crisis management. Our revenue growth has been driven by increased demand from both new and existing customers, reflecting our capability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite external pressures. 

We expect continued variability in customer concentration and timing of sales, which could impact our future revenue growth, highlighting the importance of strategic initiatives and resource allocation. Our operating expenses are expected to continue to increase as we invest in the growth of our business, which is vital for sustaining organizational health and effectiveness. Our research and development efforts focus on maintaining and developing additional functionality for our existing products, which is crucial for our organizational transformation and resilience. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and adequacy of our contract manufacturer liabilities, demonstrating our commitment to risk assessment and management.

We believe that our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and growth strategies, ensuring our organizational survival in turbulent markets. Our contractual obligations will have an impact on our future liquidity, and we believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations. We have recorded provisions for contingent losses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred, reflecting our proactive measures in risk management and crisis agency. 

The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by an increase in product margins due to favorable customer mix, indicating our ability to maintain performance under pressure. Our development model is focused on the rapid development of new features and applications, which enhances our organizational agility and competitive advantage. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time, depending on various factors, including manufacturing-related costs and customer demand, which are critical for maintaining system integrity and resilience. Our strategic planning includes expanding our sales force and marketing activities in key geographies, which is essential for reaching new end customers and enhancing our organizational capabilities.

We are a leading global provider of financial services technology, which is essential for our clients to operate their businesses and is, therefore, non-discretionary in nature. Our operations are comprised of the payments and financial institution services segments, which provide necessary services that enhance operational effectiveness and support numerous types of financial transactions. We continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to help accomplish our mission of providing integrated technology and services solutions that enable best-in-class results for our clients. These initiatives include improving operational effectiveness, being disciplined in our allocation of capital, and differentiating our products and services through innovation. The financial industry regularly introduces and implements new products, and the distinctions among these services continue to narrow as institutions seek to serve the same customers. Regulatory conditions and cybersecurity scrutiny create a challenging operating environment, leading to increased interest in solutions that help financial institutions manage information, maintain regulatory compliance, and offer innovative services. We anticipate that financial institutions will continue to invest significant resources to process transactions and enhance operating efficiency in this rapidly evolving environment. Our sizable and diverse client base provides a solid foundation for growth, and we believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients. The consolidation of financial institutions has transferred accounts among them, impacting our financial results due to early contract termination fees. However, our focus on long-term client relationships and recurring, transaction-oriented products has reduced the impact of industry consolidation. We believe our products can assist financial institutions in addressing regulatory and market challenges by providing new revenue sources and opportunities to reduce costs. Our operational efficiency initiatives have benefited our overall cost structure, and we have experienced improvements in operating income and margin due to revenue growth and scale efficiencies. The operating loss in corporate and other decreased due to lower amortization related to acquisition-related intangible assets, partially offset by acquisition and integration costs. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on various factors, including market conditions and credit ratings. We maintain a revolving credit agreement that provides liquidity to fund operating expenses and capital expenditures. Our strategic acquisitions have enhanced our service offerings and positioned us to respond effectively to environmental disruptions. Our operational flexibility and adaptability are critical in maintaining performance under pressure, ensuring we can confront unexpected situations and reconfigure our strategies as needed. The evolving marketplace necessitates a proactive approach to risk management and resource allocation, which are integral to our organizational resilience and long-term success.

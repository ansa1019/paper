We are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions, with a focus on customer relationship management, or CRM. Our core mission is to help our customers transform by empowering them to connect with their customers in entirely new ways. Our customer success platform provides the tools customers need to succeed in a digital world. Key elements of our strategy include extending existing service offerings, reducing customer attrition, and encouraging the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platforms. We evaluate opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies, which has resulted in significant acquisition activity. We believe factors influencing our ability to achieve objectives include customer willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services, the availability and performance of our service, and our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies. To address these factors, we will need to continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, provide high-quality technical support, and focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal. Our plans for future growth include expanding data center capacity, hiring additional personnel, and developing new services. We regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities to expand our service offerings. We drive innovation organically and through acquisitions, and we have a disciplined acquisition process. Our significant acquisitions have allowed us to expand our offerings, presence, and reach in various market segments. We have increased our headcount to meet higher demand for services and expect to continue investing in our enterprise cloud computing services. Our research and development efforts focus on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, and enhancing the functionality and security of our offerings. The increase in our research and development headcount supports the development of new technologies. We also plan to continue investing in marketing and sales to build brand awareness and attract new customers. Our operating expenses include significant stock-based expenses related to equity plans, and we expect these to increase as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing personnel. We have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles, which have reduced our operating income. Our typical subscription contract term is 12 to 36 months, and we calculate our attrition rate as of the end of each month. We expect our attrition rate to remain consistent as we continue to expand our enterprise business and invest in customer success programs. We derive our revenues primarily from subscription fees and related professional services, with subscription and support revenues accounting for approximately 92 percent of total revenues. We recognize subscription and support revenues ratably over the contract terms, and our deferred revenue balance consists primarily of billings received in advance of revenue recognition. We expect to continue investing in our infrastructure to scale operations and increase productivity, which may include acquiring or investing in complementary businesses. Our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, along with cash provided by operating activities, will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months.

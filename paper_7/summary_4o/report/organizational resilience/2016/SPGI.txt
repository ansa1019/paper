We have repositioned S&P Global as a more focused company in the capital and commodity markets by exiting non-core assets and investing for growth in markets that have size and scale. Our operations consist of three reportable segments: ratings, market and commodities intelligence, and S&P Dow Jones Indices. We strive to deliver on our strategic priorities in the following four categories: financial, growth, excellence, and talent. We seek to deliver strong financial performance and long-term value to our shareholders, engage with the world around us, invest to meet customer needs in high growth areas, and embrace operational excellence in all that we do. We have continued to create a portfolio focused on scalable, industry-leading, interrelated businesses in the capital and commodity markets. Our market and commodities intelligence segment is designed to help the financial community track performance, generate better investment returns, identify new trading and investment ideas, perform risk analysis, develop mitigation strategies, and provide high-value information to the commodity and energy markets that enable its customers to make better-informed trading and business decisions. We have entered into a put option agreement that gives the company the right to put the entire share capital of Quant House SAS to an independent third party, reflecting our strategic response to market dynamics. We have also completed several significant acquisitions and divestitures to enhance our capabilities and streamline our operations, which are critical for maintaining organizational resilience. Our financial data and analytics offerings provide essential information to help clients make decisions, improve efficiency, and manage risk, thereby contributing to our adaptability in a turbulent market environment. The successful integration of acquisitions is vital for enhancing our analytical offerings and expanding our presence in selected markets and geographies. Our focus on operational flexibility and strategic initiatives enables us to confront external pressures and maintain competitive advantage. The completion of our growth and performance plan aligns our efforts against key strategic priorities, which is essential for sustaining organizational health and resilience. We have recorded substantial gains from dispositions, which contribute to our financial strength and capacity for resource generation. The organizational changes we have implemented are designed to enhance our operational management and facilitate effective resource allocation. Our commitment to innovation and service excellence is reflected in our ongoing investments in technology and human capital, which are crucial for fostering a learning organization capable of thriving under adverse conditions. We continuously assess our operational resources and capabilities to ensure preparedness for unexpected situations and environmental disruptions. The strategic alignment of our business segments and the focus on enhancing our organizational coherence are fundamental to our resilience strategies, enabling us to navigate complex situations and maintain performance under pressure.

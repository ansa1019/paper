This management's discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries. Visa is a global payments technology company that connects various participants to fast, secure, and reliable electronic payments, enabling global commerce through the transfer of value and information. Our business performance is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending, reflecting the impacts of continued uneven economic growth. The acquisition of Visa Europe positions us to create additional value through increased scale and efficiencies realized by the integration of both businesses. We believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months, and we continue to assess our liquidity position in view of our operating performance and market conditions. Our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa products, with service revenues reflecting ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives. The increase in operating revenues primarily reflects continued growth in processed transactions and nominal payments volume, as well as the fiscal fourth quarter operating revenues of Visa Europe. The overall revenue growth also reflects the positive impact of select pricing modifications. Our operating expenses include personnel expenses, marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses, which have increased due to the inclusion of Visa Europe expenses and costs related to the acquisition. We maintain policies to manage liquidity risk, ensuring timely completion of payments settlement activities and making planned capital investments in our business. The framework agreement loss incurred upon consummation of the Visa Europe acquisition highlights the need for effective crisis management and operational flexibility in response to significant changes in the business environment. We have established policies and control procedures to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed, reflecting our commitment to organizational resilience. Our financial results are impacted by various legal proceedings, and we assess the probability of loss and the amount of such loss in preparing our financial statements. The effective management of our investment portfolio is crucial for maintaining liquidity, and we continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. The integration of Visa Europe is expected to enhance our operational capabilities and strategic resilience, allowing us to adapt to environmental disruptions and maintain performance under pressure. Our approach to managing client incentives and contractual obligations reflects our focus on sustaining organizational health and effectiveness, ensuring that we can respond to unexpected situations and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

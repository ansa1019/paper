As we continued to focus on our strategy to improve our business, we made progress towards strengthening our competitive position and improving our financial performance. The increase in net revenue from 2015 was due to a 9% increase in computing and graphics segment revenue and a 5% increase in enterprise, embedded and semi-custom segment revenue. During 2016, we continued to closely manage our operating expenses, which decreased to $1.5 billion compared to $1.6 billion in 2015. We also improved our balance sheet by reducing our debt and extending our debt maturities. In connection with our plans to sharpen our focus and operations on designing high-performance products, we entered into joint ventures to support our expansion into the server product market in China, which reflects our adaptability to external pressures and competitive landscape. The joint ventures are designed to enhance our capabilities and resource generation in response to evolving market demands. Our equity share in these joint ventures is a majority and minority interest, respectively, funded by our contribution of certain patents, which illustrates our strategic response to resource allocation and operational flexibility. The sixth amendment to our wafer supply agreement with GlobalFoundries provides us greater flexibility in sourcing foundry services across our product portfolio, demonstrating our resilience strategies in managing supply chain dynamics. We also recorded a licensing gain associated with the joint venture, which indicates our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity. Our total purchases from the ATMP joint venture during the year amounted to approximately $265 million, reflecting our operational management and resource utilization in a complex environment. We have no obligations to fund the ATMP joint venture, which limits our exposure to losses and enhances our organizational health. The restructuring plans implemented in previous years aimed to simplify our business and align resources with our strategic objectives, which is indicative of our organizational change processes and future orientation. The improvement in operating performance in 2016 was due to an increase in net revenue, a reduction in restructuring and special charges, and a licensing gain, partially offset by an increase in cost of sales. Our financial condition and results of operations are influenced by various external and internal factors, including competitive pressures and market conditions. We believe our cash and cash equivalents balance, along with our secured revolving line of credit, will be sufficient to fund operations over the next 12 months, demonstrating our preparedness for unexpected situations. The ongoing evaluation of our financial estimates and judgments reflects our commitment to maintaining organizational effectiveness and resilience in the face of environmental disruptions.

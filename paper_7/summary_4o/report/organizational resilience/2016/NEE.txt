Nee's operating performance is driven primarily by the operations of its two principal subsidiaries, FPL and NEER, which together represent significant capabilities in the energy sector, including the largest generation of renewable energy from wind and sun. The company has demonstrated resilience through its ability to adapt and respond effectively to environmental disruptions, as evidenced by its investments in renewable energy projects and the strategic management of its resources. In 2016, NEER added approximately 1,465 MW of wind capacity and 980 MW of solar capacity in the U.S., reflecting its commitment to service innovation and operational flexibility in the face of changing market conditions. The historical stock performance indicates a total shareholder return of approximately 130.3%, suggesting a competitive advantage and effective resource allocation strategies that support organizational health and performance maintenance. The company’s management utilizes adjusted earnings as a non-GAAP financial measure to provide a more meaningful representation of its fundamental earnings power, which aids in risk assessment and enhances decision-making processes under various operational pressures. The effective management of financial resources is critical, particularly in maintaining access to credit and capital markets, which supports the company's growth and operational continuity. The ability to foresee and confront challenges, such as the termination of merger agreements and fluctuations in market conditions, highlights NE's strategic resilience and adaptability. The company’s liquidity and capital resources are primarily derived from cash flow from operations, borrowings, and equity issuances, ensuring it can meet its obligations and invest in future projects. NEER's focus on developing natural gas pipeline infrastructure and expanding its renewable energy portfolio demonstrates a proactive approach to resource generation and operational management. The organization’s commitment to maintaining a strong investment-grade credit rating is essential for sustaining its operational capabilities and managing risks associated with external disturbances. The strategic initiatives undertaken by NEE, including the acquisition of new assets and the development of renewable energy projects, reflect a multifaceted approach to organizational resilience that encompasses crisis management, resource reconfiguration, and inter-organizational collaboration. The company’s ability to navigate complex situations, such as regulatory changes and market volatility, further underscores its organizational strength and foresight. Overall, NEE's performance under pressure and its strategic adaptation to environmental turbulence illustrate its capacity for positive adjustment and survival in a dynamic business environment.

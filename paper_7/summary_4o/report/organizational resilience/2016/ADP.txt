During fiscal 2016, we continued to focus on our global human capital management strategy, reflecting the strength of our underlying business model and our ability to adapt to the evolving needs of our clients and the changing regulatory environment within our industry. Our focus on product innovation and the high demand for additional solutions, including those that assist businesses in complying with the Affordable Care Act, demonstrate our operational flexibility and resilience in the face of external pressures. We experienced strong new business bookings, driven by our sales force's ability to sell to new and existing clients, which contributed to solid revenue growth despite challenges such as foreign currency translation and elevated losses on legacy client platforms. Our revenue retention rate, while declining, remains a point of internal focus as we upgrade clients from legacy platforms to modern cloud-based solutions, enhancing client experience and organizational health. The workforce optimization effort undertaken during the year is indicative of our strategic initiatives aimed at improving operational efficiency and adapting to market demands. We have incurred charges related to this effort, which underscores our commitment to reconfiguring resources to meet future challenges. Our financial condition remains robust, supported by a high percentage of recurring revenues and the ability to generate consistent cash flows. The introduction of long-term debt to our capital structure is intended to enhance shareholder return while maintaining operational continuity. We believe that our efforts during the fiscal year position us well for future performance, as evidenced by our ability to respond to the challenges presented by the ACA and our ongoing investments in product innovation and service capabilities. The agility demonstrated in adapting to the evolving business environment is a testament to our organizational resilience, allowing us to maintain performance under pressure and navigate complex situations effectively. Our strategic response to market volatility and external disturbances reflects a multifaceted approach to risk management, ensuring that we are prepared for unexpected situations. We continue to prioritize collaboration and inter-organizational partnerships to enhance our resilience strategies, which are essential for sustaining growth and achieving our major objectives. The emphasis on learning organization principles and knowledge management practices supports our adaptability and fosters a culture of continuous improvement. As we move forward, we remain committed to leveraging our organizational capabilities and emotional resources to confront challenges and seize opportunities for transformation and growth.

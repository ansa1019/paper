The increase in revenues in fiscal 2021 was primarily due to higher equipment and services revenues from our QCT segment, reflecting a recovery from the negative impacts of COVID-19, which illustrates the organization's ability to adapt and respond to external pressures. Our business may be impacted by various key items, including increased demand across handset, RFFE, automotive, and IoT revenue streams, indicating operational flexibility and responsiveness to market dynamics. We expect commercial 5G network deployments and device launches to continue, which necessitates strategic initiatives and resource allocation to maintain competitive advantage. The semiconductor industry continues to experience certain capacity constraints, prompting us to enter into multi-year capacity purchase commitments with suppliers, demonstrating proactive measures in resource management to mitigate risks associated with supply chain disruptions. 

Our research and development expenditures were $7.2 billion in fiscal 2021, reflecting our commitment to advancing technologies and products, which is crucial for maintaining organizational health and performance under challenging conditions. The anticipated increase in research and development costs is primarily driven by investments in advancements in 5G and application processor technologies, highlighting our focus on innovation and adaptability in a rapidly evolving market. 

We also face challenges related to current U.S.-China trade relations and national security protection policies, which may negatively impact our business and growth prospects. The ongoing assessment of legal and regulatory proceedings indicates our awareness of external disturbances and the need for strategic responses to ensure organizational resilience. 

The strategic investments and acquisitions we plan to pursue, such as the acquisition of Veoneer, are aimed at enhancing our capabilities and expanding our technological portfolio, which is essential for future planning and sustaining growth. Our capital return program, including stock repurchases and dividends, reflects our strong financial position and commitment to returning value to shareholders, while also maintaining the flexibility to invest in growth opportunities. 

We believe our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, along with expected cash flow generated from operations, will satisfy our working and other capital requirements for at least the next 12 months, underscoring our preparedness for potential adversities. The ability to foresee and confront challenges, such as fluctuations in demand and competitive pressures, is integral to our operational management and strategic resilience. 

Overall, our organizational practices, including stakeholder engagement and collaboration networks, are designed to foster a learning organization that can effectively navigate complex situations and maintain performance under pressure, ensuring long-term sustainability and success in a turbulent business environment.

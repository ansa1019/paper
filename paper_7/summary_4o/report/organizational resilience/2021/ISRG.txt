The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted our operations, leading to a substantial reduction in da Vinci procedures, particularly in China, where procedures declined by approximately 90% in early February 2020 compared to early January 2020. As the pandemic subsided, procedure volumes began to recover, reaching approximately 70% of pre-pandemic levels by the end of the first quarter of 2020. However, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the latter half of 2020 adversely affected procedure volumes in the U.S. and Europe, highlighting the need for operational flexibility and adaptability in response to external pressures. Our response to these challenges has included a focus on the health and safety of all stakeholders, ensuring continuity of supply, and securing our workforce economically. We have implemented strategic initiatives to support our customers according to their clinical, operational, and economic priorities while investing in our development programs and optimizing our supply chain. The pandemic has also led to increased difficulties in obtaining component materials, resulting in inflationary cost pressures and challenges in logistics. Despite these disruptions, we have maintained a holistic approach to our operations, emphasizing the integration of intelligent technology and systems designed to enhance the availability and applicability of minimally invasive surgery. Our business model is structured to generate recurring revenue from the sales of instruments, accessories, and services, which are critical for maintaining operational continuity and organizational health. The installed base of da Vinci surgical systems has grown, reflecting our commitment to innovation and service optimization. We have also introduced an extended use program to reduce costs for customers, thereby enhancing our competitive advantage. The strategic response to the pandemic has included the implementation of a customer relief program, which provided financial assistance to customers facing operational challenges. Our focus on learning and development has been crucial in navigating the complexities of the current business environment, enabling us to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity. The organizational resilience demonstrated through these efforts is essential for future planning and recovery, as we anticipate ongoing variability in market conditions and procedure volumes. We recognize the importance of stakeholder engagement and collaboration networks in fostering organizational success and adaptability. The strategic foresight applied in our operations aims to mitigate risks associated with supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, ensuring that we remain well-positioned to meet customer needs and maintain performance under pressure. As we continue to evolve, our emphasis on organizational learning and innovation will be pivotal in achieving long-term sustainability and resilience in a turbulent market landscape.

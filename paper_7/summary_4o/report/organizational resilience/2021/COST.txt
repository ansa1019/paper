In 2021, we believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales growth. We have been successful historically in adapting our business to changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, which includes increasing the penetration of our private-label items and enhancing our online offerings. Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices, which is integral to maintaining member loyalty and profitability. The health of the economies in which we operate, including the effects of inflation or deflation, significantly impacts our net sales growth and gross margins. We achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses, although the negative aspects of such growth, including lower initial operating profitability and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses, are declining in significance. Our e-commerce business growth has also contributed to increased sales, despite generally having a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse operations. We recognize that our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs, and we have achieved successes in this area, although some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. The incremental wage and benefit costs associated with COVID-19 have required us to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices to drive sales or meet competition, which can negatively impact gross margin as a percentage of net sales. We have experienced delays in real estate and construction activities due to COVID-19, which may affect our future operational continuity. Our operating model is consistent across our U.S., Canadian, and other international segments, although certain operations have relatively higher rates of square footage growth and lower wage costs. We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes, and our cash and investment position is deemed sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical. The impact of changes in foreign currencies and gasoline prices has also influenced our net sales and gross margin, as fluctuations in these areas can significantly affect our financial outcomes. Our approach to risk management includes utilizing a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and participating in a reinsurance program to limit exposures arising from very large losses. We strive to maintain a perception among our members of our "pricing authority" on quality goods, consistently providing competitive values. The resilience of our organizational practices is reflected in our adaptability to market conditions and our focus on long-term objectives, which include enhancing employee satisfaction and reducing turnover. Overall, our strategic initiatives are aimed at ensuring operational flexibility and maintaining performance under pressure, which are essential for our organizational resilience in a turbulent business environment.

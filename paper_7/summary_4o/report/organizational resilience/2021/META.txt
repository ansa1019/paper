In 2021, our business and results of operations have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the preventative measures implemented by authorities, which have caused business slowdowns or shutdowns in certain affected countries and regions. We experienced significant increases in the size and engagement of our active user base across a number of regions as a result of the pandemic. However, these pandemic-related trends have subsided, particularly in certain developed markets, leading to uncertainty in predicting the impact on user growth and engagement. The pandemic has also variedly impacted the demand for and pricing of our ads, with initial reductions in demand followed by an acceleration in online commerce growth. We believe this growth has moderated in many regions, adversely affecting our advertising revenue growth in the second half of 2021. Future advertising revenue growth may continue to be adversely affected by limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating systems and browsers. 

We anticipate that additional investments in our data center capacity, servers, network infrastructure, and office facilities will continue to drive expense growth in 2022. We expect that our year-over-year total expense growth rates may significantly exceed our year-over-year revenue growth rates, which would adversely affect our operating margin and profitability. Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together, and we continue to focus on major social issues facing the internet, including privacy, safety, and security. We are also committed to building new experiences that improve people's lives and supporting businesses that rely on our services to grow.

In response to competitive pressures, we have introduced new features such as Reels, which is growing in usage but is not currently monetized at the same rate as our other products. User growth and engagement have also been impacted by competitive products and services, and we have experienced year-over-year declines in ad impressions delivered in the United States and Canada region. These trends adversely affected advertising revenue growth in the second half of 2021 and are expected to continue affecting our advertising revenue growth in the foreseeable future. 

We have made significant adjustments to our operations to address these challenges, including increasing our headcount and investing in research and development to support our family of products and Reality Labs initiatives. Our operational flexibility and strategic initiatives are critical as we navigate these turbulent market conditions and strive for continued growth and resilience. The ultimate outcome of our efforts to adapt to these challenges remains uncertain, and we will continue to evaluate our strategies and resource allocation to maintain organizational health and effectiveness.

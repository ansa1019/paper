The outbreak of COVID-19 continues to impact the United States and other countries throughout the world, causing disruptions to our business and adversely affecting our financial results. Economic and market conditions, including those caused by the pandemic, have substantial impacts on our financial condition and results of operations, influencing the values of our investments, our ability to exit these investments profitably, and our ability to raise capital from investors. The U.S. federal reserve has indicated its intention to manage inflation, which may lead to significant market volatility. Geopolitical uncertainty, including the actions taken by Russia in Ukraine, has also contributed to uncertainty and volatility in the markets. Our ability to attract new capital and investors is driven, in part, by the extent to which they view the alternative asset management industry as an attractive means for capital appreciation or income. We have expanded into strategies such as real assets, credit, and insurance, and while fundraising remains competitive, we have successfully raised successor funds. However, if we are unable to raise comparably sized or larger funds, our assets under management and associated fees may be lower than in prior years. Our ability to successfully deploy capital is contingent upon identifying and executing attractive investments, which may be impacted by competition, high valuations, and general market conditions. Challenging market and economic conditions may adversely affect our ability to exit and realize value from our investments, resulting in lower-than-expected returns. The strength and liquidity of the U.S. and global equity markets generally affect the valuation of our equity positions and our ability to exit investments in a timely manner. Our insurance business is also affected by fluctuations in market interest rates, which can expose us to risks of reduced income and increased costs related to insurance liabilities. We continuously monitor our investment portfolio and the economic environment to manage risks effectively. Our operational management strategies include maintaining access to sufficient liquidity through various sources, including cash flows from operations, investment activities, and borrowings. We aim to generate cash flow from operations and income from investment activities, while also funding capital commitments and supporting new investment strategies. Our liquidity needs encompass cash required to support and grow our business lines, including funding capital commitments to existing and future funds, paying interest expenses, and servicing debt obligations. We also face potential liabilities from contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments, including commitments to fund investments and obligations arising under our debt agreements. The ability to adapt to changing economic conditions and manage risks effectively is crucial for maintaining organizational resilience.

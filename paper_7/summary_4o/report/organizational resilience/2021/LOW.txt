The increase in total sales was primarily driven by comparable sales growth, which increased 6.9% over fiscal year 2020, indicating operational flexibility and adaptability to changing market conditions. Our total home strategy continues to gain momentum as we provide a one-stop solution for both DIY and pro customers, reflecting our commitment to service innovation and customer needs. Throughout fiscal 2021, we maintained focus on the pro customer with improved in-stock inventory levels and store layout, enhanced service offerings, and expanded brand and product offerings that meet their project needs, demonstrating our ability to reconfigure resources effectively. We enhanced the customer online shopping experience with improved search and navigation functionality and expanded on-trend inventory assortments, which aligns with our strategic initiatives aimed at improving organizational effectiveness. Our disciplined focus on driving operating leverage through our perpetual productivity improvement initiatives resulted in operational process improvements that reduced the amount of time our associates spend on tasking activities and allowed them to focus on serving our customers, thus maintaining performance under pressure. As part of our continued efforts around our total home strategy, we are focused on further enhancing our omnichannel capabilities, indicating a future orientation towards resilience strategies. We believe we are well-positioned to accelerate our market share gains through our total home strategy, even amidst uncertainty in the economy with rising interest rates and inflation, showcasing our organizational strength and ability to confront external pressures. Cash flows from operations supplemented with our short-term and long-term borrowings remain sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to make strategic investments to support long-term growth and return excess cash to shareholders, reflecting our resource allocation strategies. Our capital expenditures generally consist of investments in our strategic initiatives to enhance our ability to serve customers, improve existing stores, and support expansion plans, which are critical for maintaining operational continuity. The availability and borrowing costs of these funds could be adversely affected by a downgrade of our debt ratings or a deterioration of certain financial ratios, emphasizing the importance of financial resources in our resilience framework. Our self-insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for self-insured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience, which highlights our risk management practices. We have expanded our omnichannel fulfillment capabilities, which include same-day and next-day fulfillment options, demonstrating our adaptability to customer demands and operational management. The ongoing assessment of our financial condition, liquidity, and capital resources is crucial for ensuring organizational health and sustainability, allowing us to navigate complex situations and environmental disruptions effectively.

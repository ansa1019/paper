In 2017, we continued to focus on our three main revenue growth priorities, which include helping businesses expand their use of our mobile products, developing innovative ad products that enhance business outcomes, and making our ads more relevant and effective through targeting capabilities and outcome-based measurement. We believe that these strategic initiatives are essential for maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to external pressures in a rapidly changing business environment. Our investments in security, video content, and long-term technology initiatives, such as artificial intelligence and augmented reality, are aimed at enhancing our organizational capabilities and resilience against disruptive events. We anticipate that increased investments in these areas will drive significant year-over-year expense growth, reflecting our commitment to maintaining a competitive advantage and ensuring business continuity. 

The growth in our user metrics, including a 14% increase in daily active users and monthly active users, demonstrates our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite external disturbances. Our advertising revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in mobile advertising, which represented approximately 88% of total advertising revenue, indicating our adaptability to market demands and user engagement trends. The increase in average price per ad and the number of ads delivered were influenced by our ability to innovate and respond effectively to customer needs, showcasing our organizational resilience.

We recognize the importance of resource allocation and strategic response mechanisms in navigating complex situations and environmental perturbations. Our operational management strategies, including the expansion of data center capacity and technical infrastructure, are designed to support user growth and enhance our service innovation capabilities. We also understand that effective crisis management and preparedness are critical for maintaining organizational health and performance under pressure.

Our financial results reflect a robust performance, with a net income of $15.93 billion and a significant increase in revenue, primarily from advertising. This financial strength provides us with the necessary resources to continue investing in our future-oriented initiatives and resilience strategies. We remain committed to fostering a learning organization that emphasizes knowledge management and internal knowledge sharing, which are vital for enhancing our absorptive capacity and organizational intelligence.

As we navigate the challenges posed by market volatility and external pressures, our focus on strategic foresight and proactive measures will enable us to confront uncertainties and sustain growth. We believe that our ability to reconfigure resources and adapt to unexpected situations will be crucial for our long-term success and organizational survival. Our ongoing evaluation of critical accounting policies and estimates ensures that we remain agile and responsive to changing conditions, further reinforcing our commitment to organizational resilience and effectiveness.

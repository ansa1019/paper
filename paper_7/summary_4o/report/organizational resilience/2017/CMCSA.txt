We are a global media and technology company with two primary businesses, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal. Our operations for Comcast Cable are presented in one reportable business segment, referred to as cable communications, while our operations for NBCUniversal are presented in four reportable business segments: cable networks, broadcast television, filmed entertainment, and theme parks. The results of operations of our reportable business segments are affected by competition, as all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven, and rapidly changing environments. Technological changes are intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape, challenging existing business models. Consumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content, which has reduced the number of our video customers and subscribers to our cable networks. The increasing number of entertainment choices available has intensified audience fragmentation, which adversely affects the audience ratings of our cable networks and broadcast television programming. We are responding to this competition through our X1 platform and sales and marketing programs, such as promotions and bundled service offerings. Our cable communications segment generates revenue primarily from residential and business customers that subscribe to our cable services, which we market individually and as bundled services. We continue to invest to increase our network capacity and in customer premise equipment, primarily for our X1 platform, cloud DVR technology, and wireless gateways. We believe our customer base will continue to grow as consumers choose our high-speed internet service and seek higher-speed offerings. Our theme parks segment generates revenue primarily from ticket sales and guest spending at our universal theme parks, which depend heavily on the general environment for travel and tourism. The success of our theme parks is driven by new attractions and guest spending. We continue to develop a universal theme park in Beijing, China, which reflects our commitment to expanding our operational capabilities. Our corporate and other interests include the operations of Comcast Spectacor and other business development initiatives, such as our wireless phone service launched in 2017. We maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facilities and our commercial paper programs to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. Our capital expenditures are focused on continued investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity and the deployment of wireless gateways and cloud DVR technology. We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends and repurchase shares under our publicly announced share repurchase program. Our businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities, which we believe will allow us to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements. We anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows in repaying our debt obligations, funding our capital expenditures, investing in business opportunities, and returning capital to shareholders. The operational flexibility and adaptability of our business model are essential in navigating the challenges posed by competition and technological advancements in the media and entertainment landscape.

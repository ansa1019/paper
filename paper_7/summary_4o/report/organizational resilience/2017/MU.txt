The concept of organizational resilience is reflected in our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations. We continuously evaluate alternatives for efficiently funding our capital expenditures and ongoing operations, which is crucial for maintaining operational flexibility and ensuring business continuity. Our management's discussion highlights the importance of strategic initiatives and resource allocation to adapt to unexpected situations and external pressures.

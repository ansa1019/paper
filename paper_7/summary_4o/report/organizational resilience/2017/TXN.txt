We design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Our business model is designed around sustainable competitive advantages that we believe, in combination, put us in a unique class of companies. We invest in manufacturing technologies and do most of our manufacturing in-house, which helps ensure a consistent supply of products for our customers and allows us to invest in technology that differentiates the features of our products. We have focused on creating a competitive manufacturing cost advantage by increasing factory loadings of our advanced analog 300-millimeter wafers, which support the majority of our analog growth going forward. The breadth of our portfolio means we can solve more customer needs than our competitors, giving us access to more customers and the opportunity to sell more products and generate more revenue per customer system. Our strategic focus is on analog and embedded processing, particularly in the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best growth opportunities. These products serve highly diverse markets with thousands of applications and have long-term growth opportunities. Our business model allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations, underscoring the strength of our operational capabilities. Our cash flow from operations of $5.36 billion reflects our ability to adapt and maintain performance under varying market conditions. We have gained market share in analog and embedded processing and have grown free cash flow, which is critical for maximizing shareholder value over the long term. Our operational flexibility is evident as we allocate resources from areas like manufacturing support into R&D activities, demonstrating our commitment to innovation and resilience strategies. We believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our focus on analog and embedded processing products provides long product life cycles, intrinsic diversity, and less capital-intensive manufacturing, which offer stability and strong cash generation. The combined effect of our sustainable competitive advantages is that we have developed a robust operational framework that enhances our organizational resilience. We have also been returning a significant portion of our free cash flow to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends, which underscores our commitment to maintaining organizational health and performance. Our strategic initiatives are aimed at ensuring that we can confront and benefit from sudden disruptive changes, allowing us to survive, grow, and flourish in a turbulent business environment. We have a diverse and long-lived product portfolio that reduces dependency on any single product or customer, which strengthens our resilience against market fluctuations. Our operational management and strategic response mechanisms are designed to enhance our adaptability and ensure we can effectively manage risks associated with environmental disruptions. Overall, our organizational practices and resource allocation strategies are aligned with maintaining performance under pressure and ensuring long-term sustainability.

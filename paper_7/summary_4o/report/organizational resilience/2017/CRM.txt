We are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions, with a focus on customer relationship management, or CRM. Our core mission is to empower our customers to connect with their customers in entirely new ways through cloud, mobile, social, Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence technologies. We are committed to a sustainable, low-carbon future, advancing equality and diversity, and fostering employee success, integrating social good into everything we do. Our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity, whether internally or through the use of third parties, the hiring of additional personnel, particularly in direct sales and research and development, and the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities. We expect to continue to make investments and acquisitions in the future and plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. We drive innovation organically and through acquisitions, maintaining a balanced portfolio of products and customers. Our ability to achieve our objectives includes factors such as the availability, performance, and security of our service, our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies, and our ability to continue to meet new and evolving privacy laws and regulations. We focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal, which plays a role in maintaining growth in our subscription and support revenues. Our attrition rate has remained consistent, and we continue to invest in customer programs and initiatives to support this stability. We have increased our headcount to meet higher demand for services, and we expect research and development expenses to increase as we invest in adding employees and technology to support the development of new and improved technologies. Our marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost, and we plan to continue investing in these areas to build brand awareness and attract new customers. We also expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we invest in our infrastructure and incur additional costs related to the growth of our business. Our operational management strategies include a focus on improving operating margins, enhancing service offerings, and integrating new technologies. We recognize the importance of maintaining operational flexibility and resilience in the face of external pressures and environmental disruptions. Our strategic initiatives are designed to ensure strong customer adoption and to encourage the development of third-party applications on our platforms. We evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses and technologies to expand our service offerings. Our commitment to a sustainable future and social responsibility reflects our understanding of the interconnectedness of organizational success, community resilience, and environmental stewardship. We strive to create an organizational culture that fosters adaptability, innovation, and collaboration, enabling us to respond effectively to challenges and seize opportunities for growth in a rapidly evolving market landscape.

In fiscal 2017, we experienced solid profitability and strong operating cash flows despite operating in a challenging and highly competitive environment, which has impacted our performance, particularly in the next generation networking routing and switching areas. We continue to aggressively invest in priority areas to drive profitable growth over the long term, reflecting our commitment to operational flexibility and adaptation strategies. Our evolving intent-based technologies are designed to provide customers with a highly secure, intelligent platform for their digital business, demonstrating our focus on service innovation and resilience strategies. We believe that our customers are looking for intelligent networks that provide meaningful business value through automation, security, and analytics, emphasizing our future orientation and strategic initiatives. 

The transition of our business model to increased software and subscriptions is part of our strategy to enhance organizational health and maintain performance under pressure. We have made continued progress on our strategic priorities, which include accelerating the pace of innovation and increasing the value of the network. The overall environment remains uncertain, but we are focused on resource allocation to ensure operational continuity and mitigate risks associated with external pressures and environmental disruptions. 

Our revenue from service increased by 3%, driven by contract initiations and renewals associated with product sales, which reflects our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity. The increase in deferred product revenue related to recurring software and subscription offers grew significantly, indicating our capability to adapt to changing customer needs and market conditions. 

We recognize the importance of maintaining supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times while managing the risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. Our ongoing consideration of various factors, including economic conditions and customer creditworthiness, is critical in assessing the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts and credit losses, which are essential for maintaining organizational resilience.

The restructuring actions announced in August 2016, which impacted up to 6,600 employees, are expected to be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We anticipate reinvesting the cost savings from this restructuring into key priority areas such as security, IoT, collaboration, next-generation data center, and cloud, which are aligned with our strategic adaptation and resilience engineering efforts. 

Our financial position remains strong, with cash and cash equivalents and investments totaling $70.5 billion, allowing us to utilize our resources for strategic investments, acquisitions, and shareholder returns. We believe that our strong cash position and ability to access capital markets will satisfy our liquidity requirements, enabling us to confront future challenges and sustain growth in a turbulent market environment.

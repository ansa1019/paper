During the year ended December 31, 2017, operating fundamentals remained strong for our owned and managed portfolio, which ended the year with occupancy of 97.2%. The operating fundamentals in the markets in which we operate continue to be strong, which has driven rents higher, kept occupancies high, and fueled development activity. We evaluate our business operations based on the net operating income (NOI) of our two operating segments: real estate operations and strategic capital. NOI by segment is a non-GAAP financial measure that helps management and investors understand the core operations of our real estate assets. We consider NOI by segment to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance because it reflects our ability to maintain operational effectiveness under varying market conditions. The change in real estate operations NOI during these periods was impacted by increased occupancy and positive rent rate growth, which are indicative of our adaptability to market demands. Our strategic capital segment includes revenues from asset and property management and other fees for services performed, which fluctuate based on the size of co-investment ventures under management and the timing of promotes. Our ability to generate cash from operating activities, distributions from our co-investment ventures, contributions, and dispositions of properties is considered adequate to meet our anticipated future development, acquisition, operating, debt service, dividend, and distribution requirements. We expect to fund our cash needs principally from available unrestricted cash balances, property operations, fees earned for services performed on behalf of the co-investment ventures, and proceeds from the disposition of properties. Our owned and managed properties are evaluated on an owned and managed basis, which allows management to understand the entire impact on the financial statements, affecting both the real estate operations and strategic capital segments. We have retained more than 75% of our customers based on the total square feet of leases signed for each year during the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, demonstrating our organizational resilience in maintaining customer relationships despite market fluctuations. We capitalize certain costs directly related to our development and leasing activities, which reflects our strategic response to operational demands. Our liquidity and capital resources overview indicates that we are engaged in various stages of negotiations for the acquisition or disposition of individual properties or portfolios of properties, which is part of our proactive measures to ensure organizational health and adaptability. The overall debt decreased by $1.2 billion from December 31, 2016, to December 31, 2017, primarily due to USLF assuming secured debt in conjunction with our contribution of real estate properties, illustrating our capacity to manage financial resources effectively under varying conditions. We recognize the importance of maintaining operational continuity and flexibility in our strategic planning processes to navigate environmental disruptions and ensure long-term organizational success.

In 2017, we launched a number of new high-performance products that reshaped our product portfolio and improved our technology competitiveness, demonstrating our ability to adapt and respond to market demands. The introduction of more than 40 new high-performance CPUs and GPUs, along with strong customer acceptance, reflects our operational flexibility and commitment to innovation. Our financial results improved significantly, with net revenue for 2017 reaching $5.3 billion, a 25% increase compared to 2016, indicating our resilience in maintaining performance under challenging market conditions. We also experienced an improvement in operating income, which rose to $204 million from an operating loss of $372 million in the previous year, showcasing our capacity to recover from past adversities. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by a favorable shift in product mix and higher demand for our GPU products, which illustrates our strategic response to external pressures and changing customer needs. 

Our research and development expenses increased as we made strategic investments in datacenter and high-performance products, reflecting our focus on resource allocation to enhance organizational capabilities. The restructuring plans implemented in previous years, aimed at simplifying our business and aligning resources with our priorities, have been completed, contributing to our operational continuity and resilience. We also recorded a significant licensing gain associated with our intellectual property, which further supports our financial health and adaptability in the competitive landscape.

The management's assessment of our operating performance includes segment net revenue and operating income, which are critical for understanding our organizational effectiveness and resilience strategies. The decision to exit the dense server systems business was part of our strategic adaptation to focus on core competencies and improve operational efficiency. Our liquidity position remains strong, with cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 billion, which we believe will be sufficient to fund operations and capital expenditures over the next 12 months, ensuring our preparedness for any potential disruptions.

We recognize the importance of maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions, as evidenced by our ability to foresee and confront market volatility. Our strategic initiatives, including the expansion of our product offerings and enhancements in customer engagement, demonstrate our commitment to sustaining growth and organizational survival. The ongoing evaluation of our financial condition and results of operations is essential for understanding the implications of our strategic decisions and their impact on future performance. 

In summary, our focus on innovation, operational flexibility, and strategic resource deployment has positioned us to effectively navigate environmental disruptions while maintaining organizational coherence and resilience.

In fiscal 2017, we completed the acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation, which is expected to enhance our organizational resilience by expanding our capabilities and market reach. The acquisition is anticipated to provide significant operational flexibility and improve our ability to respond to external pressures and environmental disruptions. We have undertaken various restructuring actions to improve operational effectiveness and efficiency, which are critical to maintaining organizational health and adaptability under challenging conditions. Our commitment to research and development is essential for maintaining product leadership and fostering innovation, which are key components of our resilience strategies. We believe that continued investment in R&D will enable us to develop innovative technologies and processes that can help us confront unexpected situations and enhance our competitive advantage. 

The increase in revenue across various end markets, particularly in the industrial and automotive sectors, reflects our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite the presence of adversity. We have also recorded significant increases in operational resources, which support our strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing performance under pressure. Our financial resources, including cash and cash equivalents, are being strategically deployed to ensure operational continuity and support our future planning efforts. 

We continuously monitor global macroeconomic conditions and assess opportunities for improved resource allocation, which is fundamental to our crisis management and risk mitigation efforts. The increase in accounts receivable and inventory levels is primarily attributed to the acquisition and our efforts to balance manufacturing production with demand, highlighting our capability to reconfigure resources in response to market needs. 

Our organizational practices emphasize the importance of stakeholder engagement and collaboration networks, which are vital for fostering resilience in a turbulent business environment. We remain committed to enhancing our organizational capabilities through strategic adaptation and learning processes, which will enable us to navigate complex situations effectively.

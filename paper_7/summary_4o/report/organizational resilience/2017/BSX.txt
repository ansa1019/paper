The management believes that our investment-grade credit profile reflects the size and diversity of our product portfolio, our leading share position in several of our served markets, our strong cash flow, our solid financial fundamentals, and our financial strategy. We remain committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses. Our operational net sales growth rates, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, increased significantly, driven by growth in our core franchises. We are in the process of integrating acquisitions into our business and expect these integrations to be substantially complete by the end of the designated periods. Our restructuring plans are expected to result in significant reductions in gross annual expenses, with a substantial portion of these savings being reinvested in strategic growth initiatives. We have increased our investment in infrastructure in emerging markets to maximize opportunities, reflecting our adaptability to varying market conditions. Our cash generated from operations continues to be a significant source of funds for investing in our growth, including acquisitions and strategic alliances, managing our contingencies, and reducing our debt levels. The increase in operating profit for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by our operational flexibility and strategic initiatives. We believe that our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents, future cash generated from operations, access to capital markets, and existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations and invest in our infrastructure. We assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims, indicating our proactive measures in risk management. Our liquidity plans are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including macroeconomic conditions and adverse litigation outcomes, which could limit our ability to execute our business plans effectively. We have established reserves when we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged, reflecting our approach to managing uncertainties. The company maintains effective internal control over financial reporting, which is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements. We have adopted accounting policies that require management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities. Our estimates related to legal and product liability accruals may change as additional information becomes available, emphasizing the complexity of our operational environment. The restructuring initiatives we undertake are distinct from our ongoing operations and are designed to enhance our organizational capabilities. We continue to assess the effectiveness of our internal control processes, which are critical to maintaining organizational resilience in the face of challenges. The companyâ€™s ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is reflected in our strategic planning and operational management practices.

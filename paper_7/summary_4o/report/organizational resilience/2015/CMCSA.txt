We are a global media and technology company with two primary businesses, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal. Our cable communications segment generates revenue primarily from residential and business customers subscribing to our cable services, which we market individually and as bundled services. We expect that our programming expenses will continue to increase, which may negatively impact our operating margin. We will attempt to mitigate increases in operating costs and expenses by growing revenue, particularly in our high-speed internet, video, and business services businesses. Our cable communications segment offers a broad variety of video service packages, and we are actively deploying X1 set-top boxes and cloud DVR technology throughout our footprint to improve performance and customer experience. We are continuing to expand our network of residential, outdoor, and business Wi-Fi hotspots to allow most of our high-speed internet customers to access our services inside and outside the home. The deployment of wireless gateways is aimed at improving the performance of multiple internet-enabled devices used simultaneously within the home. We have begun to offer services to large enterprises with multiple locations, which reflects our strategic initiatives to adapt to market demands and enhance our service offerings. 

In 2015, we experienced significant revenue growth across our segments, with a notable increase in our filmed entertainment segment revenue largely due to the success of major films. Our theme parks segment also saw revenue growth driven by the continued success of attractions, indicating our capacity to adapt and thrive in competitive environments. The results of operations of our reportable business segments are affected by competition, as all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven, and rapidly changing environments. We recognize that our businesses currently face a wide range of competition, and our results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively. 

We utilize operating income before depreciation and amortization as a measure of profit or loss for our operating segments, which helps us evaluate performance and allocate resources effectively. Our operational flexibility is demonstrated through our ability to respond to seasonal and cyclical variations in customer demand, as well as fluctuations in advertising revenue. Our advertising revenue is affected by the strength of the advertising market and general economic conditions, which underscores the importance of maintaining organizational health and resilience in the face of external pressures. 

We believe that adding more content and delivering it on various platforms will help us attract and retain customers, thereby enhancing our competitive advantage. Our ongoing investments in technology and customer experience improvements reflect our commitment to operational continuity and adaptability. We are also focused on strategic planning and resource management to ensure that we can respond effectively to future challenges and opportunities in the media and technology landscape.

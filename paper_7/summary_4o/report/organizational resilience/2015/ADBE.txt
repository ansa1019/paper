During fiscal 2015, we completed our acquisition of Fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, which we integrated into our digital media segment, reflecting our strategic initiative to enhance our service innovation and operational flexibility. Our revenue is derived from various software products and services, and we recognize revenue when all criteria are met, which involves significant assumptions and judgments that can impact our financial performance. We continuously evaluate our assumptions and estimates, particularly in areas such as revenue recognition and business combinations, which require critical assessments of future cash flows and market factors. The adoption of our Creative Cloud has transformed our business model, enabling us to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and maintain a competitive advantage through a subscription-based model. We have built a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers, enhancing our resilience strategies by diversifying our offerings and addressing customer needs. Our digital marketing segment has shown strong growth, driven by the continued adoption of our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions, which reflects our adaptability to market demands and operational management. We recognize the importance of research and development as a critical investment to remain competitive and to foster organizational learning and innovation. Our financial performance indicates a significant increase in annualized recurring revenue, demonstrating our ability to maintain performance under pressure and to adapt to changing market conditions. We also assess our liquidity and capital resources regularly, ensuring that we have sufficient cash and investments to meet our operational needs and to support our strategic initiatives. The restructuring plans we have implemented are aimed at aligning our resources with our business strategies, which enhances our organizational resilience by allowing us to respond to challenges effectively. Our approach to risk management includes assessing potential impacts from external disturbances and ensuring that we have mechanisms in place for crisis management and recovery. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, along with anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and support our growth strategies. The fluctuations in our deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue backlog are indicative of our strategic response to customer contracts and market conditions, which are essential for maintaining operational continuity. We are committed to leveraging our organizational capabilities and resources to navigate complex situations and to ensure long-term sustainability in a turbulent business environment.

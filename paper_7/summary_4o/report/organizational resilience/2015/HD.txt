In fiscal 2015, we completed a major payment security project that provides enhanced encryption of payment card data at the point of sale in all of our U.S. and Canadian stores, demonstrating our commitment to operational continuity and risk mitigation in response to the data breach discovered in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. Our customer experience initiative is anchored on the principles of putting customers first and taking care of our associates, reflecting our focus on organizational health and adaptability to enhance customer service. We have taken steps to improve our operational management through continuous operational improvement in the stores and our supply chain, which is part of our strategy to drive productivity and efficiency. The introduction of innovative new products and the optimization of our supply chain through Project Sync are examples of our resilience strategies aimed at maintaining performance under pressure and adapting to market demands. Our commitment to enhancing customer experience and operational flexibility is evident in our investment in technology and training for associates, which supports our ability to respond effectively to unexpected situations. The integration of our distribution networks and the rollout of new digital platforms are part of our strategic initiatives to enhance interconnecting retail, ensuring we can meet customer needs in a rapidly changing business environment. The focus on enhancing our online sales capabilities, which increased by 25.4% in fiscal 2015, illustrates our proactive measures to adapt to environmental disruptions and maintain competitive advantage. We believe that the ultimate amount paid on claims related to the data breach could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, highlighting the importance of effective crisis management and preparedness in safeguarding organizational resilience. Our financial resources, including $100 million of network security and privacy liability insurance coverage, are part of our strategy to limit exposure to losses and ensure operational integrity. We continue to evaluate information related to ongoing litigation and claims, which may impact our resource allocation and strategic response. The successful execution of our key initiatives, such as the merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, reflects our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite external pressures. Our focus on capital allocation and disciplined investment in growth opportunities, including the acquisition of Interline, aligns with our long-term objectives for organizational evolution and resilience in a turbulent market. The increase in net earnings and cash flow from operations demonstrates our capacity to adapt and thrive under challenging conditions, reinforcing our commitment to organizational success and sustainability.

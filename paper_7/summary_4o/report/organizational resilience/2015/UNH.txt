UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and making the health system work better for everyone. We leverage core competencies in advanced technology, health care data, information and intelligence, and clinical care management to meet the demands of the health system. Our businesses participate in the U.S., Brazilian, and certain other international health economies, where health care spending has consistently grown. We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow due to various factors, including inflation, medical technology advancements, regulatory requirements, and demographic trends. The rate of market growth may be affected by macro-economic conditions and regulatory changes, which have impacted and could further impact our results of operations. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in local markets, considering product positioning, price competitiveness, and environmental, competitive, legislative, and regulatory considerations. We continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across these dimensions. The health care market is changing based on demographic shifts, new regulations, and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are increasingly called upon to work together to improve overall care quality and reduce costs. We reward care providers for delivering improvements in quality and cost-efficiency, which fosters collaboration and enhances organizational capabilities. Our management activities include managing costs across all health care categories, including specialty pharmacy spending, to mitigate increases driven by unit cost pressures. We advocate for actuarially sound rates that align with our medical cost trends and remain dedicated to partnering with states committed to the long-term viability of their programs. The ongoing reductions to Medicare Advantage funding emphasize the importance of effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency. We have made adjustments to partially offset rate reductions, impacting the majority of the seniors we serve. Our strategic initiatives include expanding our individual public exchange offerings and adapting to changing market conditions. We have seen lower consumer participation than expected, prompting a reconsideration of our long-term position in the individual public exchange market. We are intensifying our medical and operating cost management and adjusting member benefits to maintain operational continuity. Our results of operations have been influenced by our acquisition of Catamaran, which has driven revenue growth and organic growth in the number of individuals served across our benefits businesses. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, and working capital balances to meet short-term and long-term obligations while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to financial regulations requiring specified levels of statutory capital. We utilize these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our operations, repay debt, and return capital to stockholders. The availability of financing is influenced by our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, and economic conditions. We expect continued moderated share repurchase activity following the acquisition of Catamaran. Our liquidity and financial position are managed in the context of our overall business strategy, with a focus on maintaining operational flexibility and adaptability in response to environmental disruptions.

We are the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the U.S. and worldwide, operating over 3,600 stores through our four main segments. In fiscal 2016, we posted strong gains in net sales and solid earnings per share growth, reflecting our ability to adapt and maintain operational flexibility in a rapidly changing business environment. We continued to generate strong cash flows, allowing us to return value to our shareholders while reinvesting in our business, including adding new stores and remodeling existing ones. Our financial performance highlights include a 5% increase in same store sales, driven by increased customer traffic, which demonstrates our capability to respond effectively to external pressures and customer needs. The fiscal 2016 increase in net sales to $30.9 billion reflects our strategic initiatives to enhance operational resources and improve performance under pressure. We implemented a wage initiative aimed at enhancing employee engagement and organizational health, which is crucial for maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher store payroll costs associated with this initiative, indicating our commitment to resource allocation that supports our workforce. Our segment profit margins were impacted by higher distribution costs and increased payroll, but we leveraged expense management to mitigate these effects. The operational adjustments made during fiscal 2016, including the transition of our e-commerce businesses to align more closely with our off-price model, reflect our resilience strategies in adapting to market demands. We also engaged in significant stock repurchase programs, which reduced our weighted average diluted shares outstanding, thereby enhancing earnings per share growth. Our liquidity and capital resources remain robust, with net cash provided by operating activities amounting to $2.9 billion, demonstrating our ability to generate cash flow and sustain operational continuity. We expect to continue investing in our infrastructure to support growth, with planned capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion in fiscal 2017, which includes investments in offices and distribution centers. The strategic response to environmental disruptions, including currency fluctuations, has been managed through inventory-related hedging instruments, illustrating our proactive measures in risk management. Our performance under pressure has been supported by a strong focus on customer traffic and merchandise margin improvements, which are essential for organizational effectiveness and resilience. We anticipate further growth in our segments, with plans to increase selling square footage and open new stores, reinforcing our commitment to adaptability and strategic foresight in a competitive landscape. The multifaceted approach to managing operational resources and enhancing organizational capabilities positions us well to confront future challenges and sustain our competitive advantage.

We are a holding company whose subsidiaries and affiliates are engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, other tobacco products, and other nicotine-containing products in markets outside the United States of America. Our products are sold in more than 180 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position. Our portfolio comprises both international and local brands. Our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors, including the volume of products we sell, the price of our products, changes in currency exchange rates, and the mix of products we sell. The changes in our reported diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2015, were influenced by various operational factors, including higher pricing and changes in marketing and administrative costs across different segments. During 2015, we recorded pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs related to severance costs for the organizational restructuring in the European Union segment. The changes did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in any of the periods presented. Our effective income tax rate for 2015 decreased, and the unfavorable currency impact during 2015 resulted from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against various currencies, which has impacted our profitability across primary revenue markets. The increase in diluted earnings per share from our operations was due to higher pricing in various segments, partially offset by higher marketing, administration, and research costs. We estimate 2016 international cigarette volume to decline by approximately 2.0%-2.5%, in line with the estimated decline of 2.4% in 2015. This forecast does not include any share repurchases in 2016 and excludes the impact of future acquisitions, unanticipated asset impairment and exit cost charges, future changes in currency exchange rates, and any unusual events. The factors described in item 1A risk factors represent continuing risks to this forecast. We believe it is appropriate to disclose adjusted diluted earnings per share as it represents core earnings, improves comparability, and helps investors analyze business performance and trends. The organizational restructuring and asset impairment costs reflect our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and operational challenges, highlighting our focus on maintaining performance under pressure and ensuring operational continuity amidst external pressures. Our strategic initiatives are aimed at enhancing organizational effectiveness and resilience in response to market volatility and environmental disruptions.

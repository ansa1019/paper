We design, develop, manufacture, and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy storage products, enhancing our offerings with all-wheel drive capability, autopilot options, and free over-the-air software updates. We have broadened the appeal of our model S by introducing new variants that improve range, performance, and value, and we expect demand for our vehicles to continue to increase worldwide. Our production capacity has been significantly increased through investments in new assembly lines and facilities, which supports our operational flexibility and ability to adapt to market demands. We have achieved significant efficiencies in model S production and plan to deliver 80,000 to 90,000 new model S and model X vehicles in 2016. We expect to continue lowering the cost of manufacturing our vehicles, which will contribute to improved automotive gross margins over time. Our expansion of stores and service infrastructure is aimed at providing timely service and supporting our growth objectives, particularly in international markets where we have limited experience. We are developing the gigafactory to integrate production of battery materials and cells, which is critical for our operational continuity and future growth. The complexity of this project may exceed our current expectations, and we may face challenges in bringing it online. Our liquidity is supported by cash flows from vehicle deliveries and customer deposits, which enable us to fund ongoing operations and research and development projects. We anticipate making significant capital expenditures to support our growth, including investments in manufacturing equipment and infrastructure. Our operating cash flows are influenced by working capital needs and fluctuations in inventory, which are essential for maintaining our production capabilities. We recognize the importance of customer financing options and the potential risks associated with resale value guarantees, which could impact our cash flows. Our strategic initiatives include expanding our supercharger network and enhancing customer engagement through innovative service offerings. We are committed to improving operational efficiency while managing costs, which is vital for maintaining our competitive advantage in a turbulent market. Our financial planning includes assessments of potential risks and uncertainties that could affect our performance and ability to meet delivery plans. We continue to evaluate our estimates and assumptions regarding future performance, which are critical for our strategic resilience and adaptability in a rapidly changing business environment.

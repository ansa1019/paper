In fiscal 2015, we completed the acquisition of Hittite Microwave Corporation, which is expected to enhance our operational capabilities and strengthen our competitive advantage in the market. The acquisition is anticipated to support our strategic initiatives and resource allocation by integrating high-performance technologies into our existing operations. We continue to monitor global macroeconomic conditions and assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency, which are critical for maintaining organizational health and resilience under challenging conditions. Our commitment to research and development is essential for fostering innovation and adapting to environmental disruptions, as we have hundreds of R&D projects underway that are vital for future growth. The increase in operational spending resulting from the acquisition, along with variable compensation linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth, reflects our focus on maintaining performance under pressure. We recognize the importance of operational flexibility and resource management in navigating unexpected situations and ensuring business continuity. Our strategic response to market demands includes ongoing assessments of our operational resources and the implementation of resilience strategies to mitigate risks associated with external pressures. We believe that a continued investment in R&D is crucial for sustaining product leadership and driving future revenue growth, which is a key component of our organizational resilience. The increase in net income in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to an increase in revenue and improved gross margin percentage, which underscores our ability to adapt and thrive in a competitive landscape. Additionally, our cash and cash equivalents position reflects our commitment to maintaining liquidity and operational continuity in the face of potential challenges. We have undertaken various restructuring actions to enhance our operational effectiveness, which are expected to yield significant cost savings and support our long-term objectives. The strategic planning and execution of our initiatives are designed to ensure that we can confront and recover from adverse conditions while continuing to meet customer needs. Our focus on collaboration networks and inter-organizational collaboration enhances our capacity to absorb strain and reconfigure our operations in response to market changes. The performance variability observed in our financial results highlights the need for ongoing vigilance and adaptability in our organizational practices. We are committed to fostering an organizational culture that emphasizes learning and knowledge management, which are essential for navigating complex situations and ensuring long-term sustainability. Our proactive measures in crisis management and emergency preparedness are integral to our resilience framework, enabling us to effectively respond to disruptive events and maintain operational integrity.

The concept of organizational resilience is reflected in our strategic initiatives and operational management, particularly in response to environmental disruptions and the need for adaptation. We continuously evaluate alternatives for efficiently funding capital expenditures and ongoing operations, which is essential for maintaining operational continuity and ensuring our ability to confront unexpected situations. Our management's discussion highlights the importance of resource allocation and the strategic response to pressures that impact our financial condition and results of operations. The expansion of our clean room space in Singapore is a proactive measure aimed at enhancing our capacity to respond to market demands and improve our operational flexibility. This strategic adaptation is crucial for maintaining performance under pressure and ensuring the sustainability of our business model in turbulent markets. 

Furthermore, our commitment to research and development reflects our focus on innovation and the development of new product and process technologies, which are vital for achieving competitive advantage and enhancing organizational capabilities. The integration of advanced manufacturing technologies is designed to facilitate our transition to next-generation memory products, thereby improving our resilience against market volatility. The restructuring activities undertaken to optimize operations and improve efficiency demonstrate our ability to reconfigure resources and enhance organizational strength. 

We recognize the significance of inter-organizational collaboration and stakeholder engagement in fostering a learning organization that can absorb knowledge and adapt to complex situations. The financial resources generated from operations are critical for supporting our strategic initiatives and ensuring that we can navigate through adverse conditions. Our liquidity and capital resources analysis indicates that we have sufficient cash flows to meet our requirements, which is essential for maintaining organizational health and resilience. 

The management of risks associated with our operations, including the assessment of potential impacts from external disturbances, is integral to our resilience strategies. We have established mechanisms for crisis management and emergency preparedness, which are essential for mitigating risks and ensuring recovery from disruptive events. Our focus on operational management and resource generation is aimed at enhancing our ability to function effectively under varying conditions, thereby supporting our long-term objectives and organizational evolution. 

In summary, our organizational practices are designed to foster resilience through strategic foresight, operational flexibility, and a commitment to continuous improvement, enabling us to thrive in a dynamic and often challenging business environment.

We are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions, with a focus on customer relationship management, or CRM. Our mission is to help our customers transform themselves into customer-centric companies by empowering them to connect with their customers in entirely new ways. Our customer success platform provides the next-generation platform of enterprise applications and services to enable customer success. Key elements of our strategy include strengthening our market-leading solutions, expanding strategic relationships with customers, and encouraging the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platforms. We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include the availability, performance, and security of our service, our ability to continue to release and gain customer acceptance of new and improved features, and our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies. To address these factors, we will need to continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions and provide high-quality technical support to our customers. Our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity, the hiring of additional personnel, and the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities. We regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses and technologies in an effort to expand our service offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business. Our attrition rate was between eight and nine percent during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, which is favorable compared to the nine to ten percent attrition rate as of January 31, 2015. We expect our attrition rate to remain in this range as we continue to expand our enterprise business and invest in customer success and related programs. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, and enhancing the functionality and security of our enterprise cloud computing services. Our proprietary architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. We have invested in additional database software and plan to increase the capacity that we are able to offer globally through data centers and third-party infrastructure providers. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity. We believe that this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings. Our operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities and is influenced by the timing of collections from our customers, which is our largest source of operating cash flows. Our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods, including the timing of payments against accounts payable and accrued expenses. We expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars and remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues in future periods as a result of continued office build-outs, other leasehold improvements, and data center investments. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months.

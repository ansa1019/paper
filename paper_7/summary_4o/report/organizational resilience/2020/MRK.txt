The company actively monitors the business development landscape for growth opportunities that meet its strategic criteria, which reflects its adaptability and responsiveness to external pressures. During 2020, despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Merck continued executing on its strategic priorities, reporting year-over-year sales growth. The company’s operations were affected by patients' inability to access health care providers, but it experienced a partial recovery in underlying demand for products across its key growth pillars in the latter part of the year. Merck's employees maintained clinical studies, progressed the pipeline, and ensured supply and patient access to its portfolio of medically important medicines and vaccines, demonstrating operational flexibility and resilience in the face of adversity.

The company is also pursuing a planned spin-off of its women's health, biosimilars, and established brands into a new independent company, which is expected to allow each entity to focus on its strengths and market opportunities. This strategic reconfiguration is part of Merck's broader approach to maintain operational continuity and resilience under challenging conditions. The company’s capital allocation priorities include completing business development transactions and investing in its pipeline, which reflects a commitment to resource generation and future planning. Merck’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic included collaborations to develop antiviral candidates and vaccines, showcasing its crisis management capabilities and ability to adapt to unexpected situations. The company anticipates ongoing residual negative impacts from the pandemic, particularly regarding vaccine sales, but remains confident in the fundamental underlying demand for its products and its prospects for long-term growth. Merck's ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is indicative of its organizational resilience, which is further supported by its commitment to research and development, strategic collaborations, and proactive measures to address market challenges.

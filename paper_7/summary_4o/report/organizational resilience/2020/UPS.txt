During 2020, we began implementing our customer first, people led, innovation driven strategy, as we seek to transform nearly every aspect of our business, improve our financial performance, provide the best customer experience and benefit our shareowners. The unexpected business shutdowns and government restrictions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly impacted the mix of demand for our services, highlighting the need for operational flexibility and adaptability in our response strategies. We believe that the market shift towards e-commerce will persist, which may continue to increase demand but also drive higher operating costs. We are focused on enhancing the capabilities that we believe our customers value the most, including speed and ease of access to our services, which is essential for maintaining organizational health under challenging conditions. Our investments to improve our ground network and digital access program have contributed to our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite the presence of adversity. The pandemic resulted in a reduction in global air cargo capacity, causing market rates in the industry to increase and leading to increased demand for our services. We recognize the importance of strategic initiatives and resource allocation in navigating these environmental perturbations. Our divestiture of the UPS Freight business is expected to allow us to focus on core parts of our business that drive the greatest value, enhancing our competitive advantage and operational continuity. We believe that we are well positioned for long-term growth, although we cannot reasonably estimate the duration or severity of the pandemic or the timing and extent of the anticipated economic recovery. The increase in average daily package volume was driven by business-to-consumer shipping, which reflects our ability to adapt to changing customer needs and market conditions. The growth from small and medium-sized businesses, as well as other large customers, demonstrates our resilience and capacity for resource generation during periods of disruption. Our operational management strategies have been adjusted to better reflect the operational activities associated with our products, ensuring that we maintain performance under pressure. The overall increase in operating expenses was driven by higher pickup and delivery costs, reflecting the need for effective crisis management and resource utilization in response to increased demand. We experienced growth in demand for our healthcare logistics and distribution solutions, partly driven by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which underscores the multifaceted nature of organizational resilience. Our focus on transformation strategy costs, including investments in technology and capacity expansion, is crucial for sustaining performance and ensuring that we can confront future challenges effectively. The anticipated economic recovery will require us to continue refining our operational practices and maintaining a proactive approach to risk management, ensuring that we can navigate the complexities of the current business environment.

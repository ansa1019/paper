The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted our operations, leading to a substantial reduction in da Vinci procedures, particularly in regions like China and the U.S. where procedures per week declined sharply. As the pandemic subsided in some areas, we observed a gradual recovery in procedure volumes, although the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in various regions has led to further declines in elective procedures. The pandemic has created an environment of uncertainty, affecting hospital spending and the timing of system placements. Our response to these challenges has focused on ensuring the health and safety of all stakeholders, supporting our customers' clinical and operational priorities, and securing our workforce economically. We have implemented a customer relief program to provide financial support, which included service fee credits and deferred lease payments, aimed at mitigating the adverse effects of the pandemic on our customers. The deferral of system purchases and leases has resulted in unused capacity in our installed base, which we expect hospitals to address before making new system acquisitions. As hospitals navigate the ongoing disruptions, we anticipate that system placements will lag behind the recovery of da Vinci procedure volumes. The depth and extent of the pandemic's impact on individual markets will vary based on local conditions, including the availability of medical resources and government interventions. Our strategic initiatives include optimizing training pathways and supply chains for new product introductions, such as the da Vinci SP surgical system, which is designed to enhance surgical capabilities and address customer needs in a changing healthcare environment. We continue to invest in our development programs while managing costs to ensure operational continuity. The installed base of da Vinci surgical systems has grown, reflecting our commitment to service innovation and operational flexibility. We utilize metrics such as installed base and utilization rates to inform our financial and operational decision-making, which are critical for maintaining organizational resilience in the face of external pressures. Our focus on collaboration with healthcare providers and investment in advanced technologies positions us to adapt to future challenges and enhance our competitive advantage. As we navigate this turbulent market, we remain committed to fostering organizational health through strategic foresight and resilience strategies that prioritize recovery and transformation in response to disruptive events.

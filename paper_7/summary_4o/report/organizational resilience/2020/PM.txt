We are leading a transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smoke-free future and ultimately replace cigarettes with smoke-free products to the benefit of adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, society, the company and its shareholders. Through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation, we aim to ensure that our smoke-free products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements. Our smoke-free product portfolio includes heat-not-burn and nicotine-containing vapor products. Our business is managed in six operating segments, and our cigarettes are sold in more than 175 markets, holding the number one or number two market share position in many of these markets. We are engaged in the development and commercialization of reduced-risk products, which present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continuing smoking. Our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors, including the volume of products we sell, the price of our products, changes in currency exchange rates, and the mix of products we sell. The change in our net revenues from the comparable 2019 amount was driven by unfavorable volume/mix, primarily due to lower cigarette volume, partially offset by higher heated tobacco unit volume. The unfavorable impact of $253 million resulted from the deconsolidation of our Canadian subsidiary and lower fees for certain distribution rights billed to customers in certain markets. Our marketing, administration and research costs include the costs of marketing and selling our products, and costs incurred to develop new products. As a holding company, our principal sources of funds are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries, which are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions compliant with law. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic particularly impacted our net revenues, with a decrease of $1.1 billion, or 3.7%, from the comparable 2019 amount. The operational flexibility demonstrated during this period reflects our ability to adapt to external pressures and maintain performance under challenging conditions. Our strategic initiatives focus on resilience strategies that enable us to confront and benefit from sudden disruptive changes, ensuring organizational survival and growth. The multifaceted nature of our operations allows us to absorb strain and preserve functionality despite the presence of adversity, thereby enhancing our organizational health and effectiveness. The trajectory model of our organizational resilience emphasizes our capability to reconstitute and reconfigure responses toward disruptive events, ensuring that we emerge stronger from challenging situations. Overall, our strategic response mechanisms and resource management practices are designed to maintain integrity and performance while navigating environmental disruptions and uncertainties.

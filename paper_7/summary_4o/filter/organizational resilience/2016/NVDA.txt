The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-K. Our company has extended its emphasis in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI, delivering value to customers through various architectures. Vertical integration enables us to bring together hardware, system software, and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. Our revenue for fiscal year 2017 grew 38% to $6.91 billion, reflecting growth in each of our market platforms. The GPU business revenue was $5.82 billion, up 39% from a year earlier, led by growth in our GeForce GPU gaming and datacenter platforms. Datacenter growth reflected strong demand for deep learning training and cloud computing. We introduced various new products and collaborated with significant partners to enhance our capabilities in AI and deep learning, demonstrating our adaptability and responsiveness to market demands. Our management's discussion and analysis are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to revenue recognition and inventory management, which are critical for maintaining operational flexibility and addressing market conditions. We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, and we defer recognition of revenue for certain distributors until products are resold, reflecting our strategic response to market variability. Our customer programs, including rebates and marketing development funds, are designed to support our partners' activities while promoting our products, which is essential for sustaining competitive advantage. Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business conditions and unexpected competitive pricing actions, necessitating effective risk management and resource allocation strategies. Our operating expenses reflect growth in headcount and related costs, which are essential for maintaining organizational health and operational continuity. We are involved in legal actions and investigations, which introduce uncertainties that could materially affect our business and financial condition. Our liquidity is primarily derived from cash and cash equivalents, which we believe will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. We have access to external sources of financing if cash is needed, ensuring our resilience in the face of potential financial pressures. Our cash balances are held in numerous locations, and we have not provided for U.S. federal and state income taxes on undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, which reflects our strategic foresight in managing international operations. We intend to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining organizational strength and performance under pressure. Overall, our strategic initiatives and operational management practices are designed to enhance our resilience and adaptability in a rapidly changing business environment.

We also continued to embrace automation across the company, leveraging new tools that we believe will deliver higher rates of production. Our strategies are designed to address key challenges facing our company, including uncertain and volatile macroeconomic conditions, climate change, and political instability, which can impact our operational continuity. We believe that many of these challenges also create new opportunities for our company. We intend to focus on making healthier products and fostering a healthier planet by reducing our environmental impact, which is essential for maintaining our competitive advantage. 

Our risk management framework involves identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and addressing top strategic, financial, and operational risks. The board of directors oversees this integrated risk management framework, ensuring that we are prepared for unexpected situations and can effectively respond to disruptive events. We leverage an integrated risk management framework to manage risks associated with commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, and interest rates, which are critical for maintaining our operational effectiveness. Our commitment to innovation and service quality reflects our aim to enhance organizational resilience and adaptability in the face of external pressures. 

We continuously review our business results and strategies, which encompass financial discipline in our strategic and daily business decisions. Our executive committee is actively involved in monitoring results and controls. We also engage strong corporate governance from our board of directors, which includes oversight of our compliance policies and practices. Our operations are designed to ensure that we can effectively manage resource allocation and respond to environmental disruptions.

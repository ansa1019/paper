We are the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the U.S. and worldwide, selling a rapidly changing assortment of merchandise at prices generally 20% to 60% below department and specialty store regular prices. We continued to generate strong cash flows, allowing us to return value to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, while reinvesting in our business by adding new stores and remodeling existing ones. Our fiscal 2017 was marked by a strong increase in net sales and solid earnings per share growth, driven primarily by an increase in customer traffic. We define same store sales as sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, reflecting our operational flexibility and adaptability to market demands. The increase in same store sales was primarily due to an increase in customer traffic, indicating our ability to absorb strain and maintain functioning despite external pressures. Our consolidated average per store inventories were down 5% at the end of fiscal 2017, demonstrating effective resource management and operational continuity. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment profit or loss, which reflects our strategic initiatives and resource allocation. The increase in segment profit margin was favorably impacted by an increase in merchandise margin and expense leverage, indicating our resilience strategies in response to market conditions. We continue to strengthen our infrastructure in support of our growth, which is essential for maintaining organizational health and effectiveness. Our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates, which can create external disturbances that we must navigate to sustain performance. The improvement in our cost of sales ratio was driven by an increase in merchandise margin, showcasing our ability to adapt to changing market conditions. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher employee payroll costs and investments to support growth, reflecting our commitment to enhancing organizational capabilities. We plan to fund our capital expenditures through internally generated funds, ensuring we have the resources necessary to support our strategic growth initiatives. Our stock repurchase programs and dividend declarations reflect a proactive approach to managing our financial resources and responding to shareholder demands. We have provided for deferred U.S. taxes on all undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries, indicating our strategic foresight in managing tax obligations. The increase in general corporate expense for fiscal 2017 was driven by continued investments in corporate systems and technology, which are critical for enhancing our operational management and resilience. Our liquidity and capital resources are more than adequate to meet our operating needs, demonstrating our organizational strength and ability to confront future challenges. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, along with our credit facilities, position us well to maintain operational continuity and support our strategic objectives in a turbulent market environment.

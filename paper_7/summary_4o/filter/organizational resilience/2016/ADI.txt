We monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years. We expect that annual cost savings resulting from these actions will be used to make additional investments in products that we expect will drive revenue growth in the future. We believe that a continued commitment to research and development is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products. Our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite the presence of adversity is critical to our operational management and strategic adaptation. We have hundreds of R&D projects underway, none of which we believe are material on an individual basis. We are committed to maintaining operational continuity and flexibility in response to environmental disruptions and unexpected situations. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to changes in working capital and higher net income adjusted for non-cash items. Our liquidity and capital resources are designed to support our operational effectiveness and resilience strategies, enabling us to confront challenges and maintain performance under pressure. We expect to finance the proposed acquisition using both short- and long-term indebtedness totaling approximately $11.6 billion, supported by fully underwritten bridge financing commitments. Our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, and dividend payments in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months. The impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant, indicating our resilience in managing external pressures. We recognize the importance of strategic initiatives and inter-organizational collaboration in enhancing our organizational capabilities and ensuring long-term sustainability. Our operational resources are continually monitored to minimize credit risk and ensure effective resource allocation. We believe that our strategic response to market volatility and environmental turbulence will enhance our organizational effectiveness and adaptability. The acquisition of Hittite Microwave Corporation is expected to contribute to our competitive advantage by expanding our capabilities and enhancing our product offerings. We continue to operate and track our results in one reportable segment based on the aggregation of seven operating segments, reflecting our organizational coherence and ability to manage complexity. Our commitment to innovation and learning organization principles supports our resilience in the face of disruptive change, allowing us to foresee and adapt to evolving market demands. We expect that the actions taken to improve operational effectiveness will result in enhanced organizational health and performance maintenance, ultimately contributing to our long-term success and growth.

The objectives of our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are to provide users of our consolidated financial statements with a narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, and certain other factors that may affect future results. Our ability to acquire and retain branded customers is important to our business in the generation of revenues, and we believe our un-carrier strategy, along with ongoing network improvements, has been successful in attracting and retaining customers as evidenced by continued branded customer growth and improved branded postpaid phone and branded prepaid customer churn. The introduction of our un-carrier strategy has focused on eliminating customer pain points and has included various initiatives aimed at enhancing customer experience and operational flexibility. We have seen a significant increase in service revenues primarily due to growth in our average branded customer base as a result of strong customer response to our un-carrier initiatives and the success of our MetroPCS brand. The operational management of our network, including the build-out of our 700 MHz A-block spectrum licenses, reflects our commitment to maintaining organizational resilience through strategic investments in technology and infrastructure. Our financial condition and results of operations indicate that we are well-positioned to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and adapt to changing market conditions. The increase in our operating income and adjusted EBITDA demonstrates our ability to maintain performance under pressure and to generate cash flows that support our ongoing operational needs. We recognize the importance of risk management and have implemented strategic initiatives to mitigate potential risks associated with market volatility and customer churn. Our focus on customer satisfaction and loyalty, driven by improvements in network quality and service offerings, has contributed to our organizational health and resilience. We are committed to fostering an environment that encourages innovation and adaptability, which are critical for thriving in a competitive landscape. The successful execution of our strategic response to external pressures has enabled us to enhance our operational capabilities and to sustain growth even in the face of adversity. Our approach to resource management, including the deployment of financial and operational resources, reflects our understanding of the complexities of the business environment and our commitment to resilience strategies that ensure long-term success. The ongoing assessment of our performance and the implementation of proactive measures to address emerging challenges underscore our dedication to organizational effectiveness and sustainability. The collaborative networks we have established with partners and stakeholders further enhance our capacity to navigate disruptive changes and to maintain a trajectory of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

Our fiscal year ended on October 2, 2016, demonstrated the strength of our global business model and our ability to successfully make disciplined investments in our business and our partners (employees). The growth in company-operated store revenues was primarily driven by a 5% growth in comparable store sales, incremental revenues from net new store openings, and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016. The increase in comparable store sales reflects our focus on service innovation and operational flexibility, which are critical for maintaining performance under pressure. The Americas segment continued to perform well, with revenues growing significantly, driven by beverage innovation and the success of our food offerings, which indicates our adaptability to changing customer needs and market demands. 

In fiscal 2017, we expect continued strength in our revenue, operating margin, and earnings per share results, driven by our strategic initiatives, including the expansion of our store portfolio and investments in our partners and digital platforms. These investments are aimed at enhancing operational continuity and ensuring business resilience in the face of external pressures. Our management team continues to align leadership with evolving business strategies, reinforcing our commitment to organizational health and performance maintenance.

The channel development segment's revenue growth was primarily due to higher sales of premium single-serve products and increased foodservice sales, demonstrating our ability to reconfigure resources and respond effectively to market opportunities. We anticipate that our strategic planning and proactive measures will support our growth agenda, enabling us to confront future challenges and uncertainties in the business environment.

We actively manage our cash and investments to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments, and return cash to shareholders, which reflects our commitment to resource management and financial resilience. Our credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes, ensuring that we have the necessary resources to navigate potential disruptions.

Our financial risk management policy governs how we manage exposure to various market-based risks, including commodity price fluctuations and foreign currency exchange rates, which are essential for maintaining system integrity and resilience. We utilize hedging instruments to mitigate risks associated with market volatility, demonstrating our strategic response to environmental perturbations.

The combination of our disciplined investments, strategic foresight, and focus on operational management positions us to not only survive but flourish in turbulent markets. Our commitment to learning organization principles and knowledge management enhances our absorptive capacity, enabling us to adapt and thrive amid complex situations and unexpected challenges. The emphasis on emotional resources and stakeholder engagement further strengthens our organizational dynamics and collaborative networks, critical for sustaining long-term growth and resilience.

The railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our one reportable business segment. We continued our focus on safety to reduce risk and eliminate incidents for our employees, customers, and the public. We achieved our best ever reportable personal injury incidents per 200,000 employee-hours of 0.75. Our operating income of $7.3 billion reflects a 10% decrease compared to 2015, despite a 7% decrease in carloads, indicating our ability to maintain performance under pressure. Core pricing gains, productivity initiatives, and efficient network operations partially offset lower volumes, demonstrating operational flexibility in response to external pressures. Our operating ratio for 2016 was 63.5%, increasing 0.4 points from last year's record operating ratio of 63.1%, but matching our second-best record from 2014. Continued improvements were made in our operating and service metrics, as our average train speed increased 5% in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting improved network fluidity. We will continue using a multi-faceted approach to safety, utilizing technology, risk assessment, training, and employee engagement, which supports our organizational health. In 2017, we will continue to align resources with customer demand, maintain an efficient network, and ensure surge capability with our assets. Economic conditions in many of our market sectors continue to drive uncertainty with respect to our volume levels, indicating the need for strategic adaptation. We expect volume to grow in the low single-digit range in 2017 compared to 2016, but it will depend on the overall economy and market conditions. Our capital plan for 2017 is expected to be approximately $3.1 billion, which may be revised if business conditions warrant or if new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments. We will continue to invest in our network and terminals, balancing terminal capacity with mainline capacity, which is critical for maintaining operational continuity. We expect to fund our 2017 cash capital plan by using cash generated from operations, proceeds from the sale or lease of various properties, and cash on hand. Our annual capital plan is a critical component of our long-term strategic plan and is designed to enhance the long-term value of the company. We maintain adequate resources and have access to capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements, ensuring organizational resilience. Our access to liquidity through the capital markets is dependent on our financial stability, and we expect to continue to have access to liquidity through various sources. We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, which may impact our operations. We have identified sites at which we may be liable for remediation costs, reflecting the complexity of our operational environment. We do not expect that any known lawsuits, claims, or environmental costs will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is a key aspect of our organizational resilience.

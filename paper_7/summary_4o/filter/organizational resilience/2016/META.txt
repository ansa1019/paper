In 2016, we continued to make progress on our three main revenue growth priorities, including capitalizing on the shift to mobile and growing the number of marketers using our ad products, which reflects our adaptability to changing market conditions. We believe these investments and our increasingly global scale will drive significant overall year-over-year expense growth compared to 2016, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining operational flexibility and resilience in the face of external pressures. Our user growth metrics indicate a 18% increase in daily active users and a 17% increase in monthly active users year-over-year, which are critical for sustaining our performance under pressure and ensuring business continuity. The increase in user engagement and the demand for our ad inventory are indicative of our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite the presence of adversity. We anticipate that our expenses will continue to grow as we execute on priorities such as hiring top engineering talent and investing in research and development, which are essential for fostering innovation and enhancing our organizational capabilities. The trends in our user metrics and monetization by user geography reflect the complexity of our operational environment and our strategic response to varying market conditions. Our revenue growth has been driven by an increase in demand for our ad inventory, which is a testament to our resilience strategies and mechanisms that allow us to confront and benefit from sudden disruptive changes. We have also recognized the importance of effective resource allocation and management in supporting our operational continuity and enhancing our organizational effectiveness. Our financial results indicate a strong performance, with net income of $10.22 billion, reflecting our ability to navigate through economic fluctuations and maintain a competitive advantage. We are committed to ongoing investments in our technology initiatives, which are vital for our long-term sustainability and organizational transformation. The increase in capital expenditures and research and development expenses underscores our proactive measures to adapt to future challenges and enhance our operational management. Our ability to foresee and respond to environmental disruptions is critical for maintaining our organizational health and ensuring we can thrive in a turbulent business environment. We have implemented strategic initiatives that focus on expanding our data center capacity and office facilities to support our rapid growth, which is essential for reconfiguring our resources to meet evolving customer needs. The anticipated growth in cash flow from operations, alongside our strategic planning and resource generation efforts, positions us well to confront future uncertainties and enhance our organizational resilience.

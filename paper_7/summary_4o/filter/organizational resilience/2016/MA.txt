In the fourth quarter of 2016, the company began using the term "switched" transactions instead of "processed" transactions to differentiate its authorization, clearing, and settlement activities from its issuer/acquirer processing activities. The competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of the business. Adverse economic trends, including distress in financial markets and turmoil in specific economies, have impacted the environment in which the company operates. The significant concentration of revenue generated in the United States makes the business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in that region. The company continues to monitor political and economic conditions around the world to identify opportunities for growth and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry. The overall business environment may present challenges for the company to grow its business. The company generates revenue and has financial assets in countries at risk for currency devaluation, which could be negatively impacted if a devaluation of local currencies occurs relative to the U.S. dollar. The company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities balances, along with its cash flow generating capabilities and access to capital resources, are sufficient to satisfy its future operating cash needs and obligations. The company has established a commercial paper program and a committed unsecured revolving credit facility to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes, including business continuity. The company may borrow and repay amounts under these facilities for business continuity purposes. The company’s management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures facilitates an understanding of its operating performance and provides a meaningful comparison of results between periods. The company’s financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies. The company regularly reviews the status of significant claims and legal proceedings and assesses its potential financial exposure, which requires significant judgment. The company’s judgments may be materially different than actual outcomes due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process. The company’s estimates regarding the timing and amount of taxable and deductible items adjust the pretax income earned in various tax jurisdictions, which may impact its effective income tax rate. The company considers business plans, planning opportunities, and expected future outcomes in assessing the needs for future expansion and support of its international operations. The company’s estimates in the valuation of acquired assets and impairment reviews require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. The company’s operational flexibility is influenced by its ability to manage foreign currency risks and the impact of foreign exchange activity on its financial results. The company’s strategic initiatives are designed to support its operational continuity and adaptability in response to external pressures and environmental perturbations. The company’s ability to foresee and confront challenges, as well as its focus on resource allocation and operational management, contribute to its overall organizational resilience.

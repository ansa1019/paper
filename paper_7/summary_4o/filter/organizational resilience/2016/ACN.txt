The provided text primarily discusses net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and does not explicitly address "IT capability" or related concepts. However, the context of organizational structure and financial performance may imply underlying operational frameworks that could involve IT capabilities in supporting business processes and decision-making. The mention of equity interests and subsidiaries suggests a complex organizational environment where effective coordination of assets and management practices could be essential for enhancing overall firm performance. While the text lacks direct references to information technology or its capabilities, it underscores the importance of organizational relationships and financial metrics, which are often influenced by the deployment and management of IT resources in achieving strategic goals. Thus, although not explicitly stated, the operational dynamics and financial structures discussed may indirectly relate to the broader concept of IT capability in facilitating business transformation and competitive positioning.

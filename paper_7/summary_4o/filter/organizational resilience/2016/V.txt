This management's discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries. Our business performance during fiscal 2016 reflects the impacts of continued uneven and tepid economic growth, which presents external pressures that may affect future earnings. The acquisition of Visa Europe positions us to create additional value through increased scale and efficiencies realized by the integration of both businesses. We believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months, reflecting our operational flexibility and preparedness to confront potential challenges. Our treasury policies provide management with guidelines to manage liquidity risk, ensuring timely completion of payments settlement activities and making planned capital investments in our business. We maintain adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios, which is crucial for sustaining organizational health under adverse conditions. 

The integration of Visa Europe is expected to enhance our capabilities and resilience strategies, allowing us to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite the presence of adversity. The overall economic conditions and consumer spending are factors that impact our business, necessitating a systemic perspective on our operations. Our financial results for fiscal 2016 include the impact of several significant one-time items, which we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to acquisition-related costs and severance charges related to personnel reductions, reflecting our adaptive strategies in response to the acquisition. 

We recorded net operating revenues of $15.1 billion for fiscal 2016, driven by continued growth in processed transactions and nominal payments volume. The effect of exchange rate movements resulted in a negative impact on our total operating growth, indicating the need for effective risk management strategies to mitigate external disturbances. Our operating revenues and related processed transactions do not reflect the financial results of Visa Europe from the acquisition date through June 30, 2016, as the impact was immaterial. 

We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations and may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our investment portfolio is designed to meet our working capital and liquidity needs, while our commercial paper program supports our operational management. The ongoing assessment of our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity is critical in view of our operating performance and current economic conditions. 

In conclusion, our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is a reflection of our organizational resilience. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives, which is essential for maintaining performance under pressure and ensuring operational continuity.

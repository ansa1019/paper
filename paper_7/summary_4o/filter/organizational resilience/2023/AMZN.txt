This annual report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements that reflect management's current expectations and are inherently uncertain. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores through improved customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, and offering faster delivery. Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows, driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing accounts receivable, inventory, and cash capital expenditures. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time, influenced by product mix, supply chain disruptions, and our investment in new geographies and product lines. Our technology and infrastructure investments support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in technology and infrastructure to enhance customer experience and improve process efficiencies. The macroeconomic environment, including inflation and supply chain volatility, directly impacts our operations and results. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements and seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate greater selection and in-stock inventory levels. Our operating income is a more meaningful measure than gross profit due to the diversity of our product categories and services. The increase in operating income in 2023 is primarily due to increased unit sales and advertising sales, partially offset by increased shipping and fulfillment costs. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and we seek to mitigate costs of shipping through achieving higher sales volumes and optimizing our fulfillment network. We also expect spending in technology and infrastructure to increase over time as we add employees and infrastructure. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, offset by cash payments for products and services, employee compensation, and other operating expenses. We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, and consider acquisitions or investments that might affect our liquidity requirements. Our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including changes in business operations and developments in tax controversies. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term. We expect some or all of the macroeconomic factors to continue impacting our operations into the future. The increase in technology and infrastructure costs in 2023 is primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure and payroll costs associated with technical teams. We seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture to minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results. We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months, although projections of future cash needs are subject to substantial uncertainty.

The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. emphasizes the importance of business continuity planning (BCP) and operational resilience to ensure that critical functions can continue to operate in the event of a disruption. The firm maintains a comprehensive control framework designed to minimize operational risks, including those arising from inadequate or failed internal processes and external events. The firmwide operational risk and resilience committee oversees operational risk and seeks to ensure business resilience. This includes monitoring threats, assessing risks, and ensuring readiness for significant operational disruptions. The resilience framework incorporates testing of response and recovery strategies to minimize and prevent operational disruptions. The firm also conducts regular stress tests to quantify exposure to tail risks and assess vulnerabilities, which are integral to maintaining adequate capital levels during periods of economic stress. 

Goldman Sachs recognizes that increased reliance on technology and third-party relationships has led to heightened operational risks, including cybersecurity risks. The firm has established a cybersecurity program to identify, assess, and mitigate threats, ensuring that controls are in place to protect data and systems. The board oversees risk management policies, including those related to cybersecurity, and receives regular updates on the effectiveness of the cybersecurity program. 

The firm’s risk management framework includes a comprehensive approach to liquidity risk, ensuring the ability to fund operations even during adverse circumstances. This involves holding sufficient excess liquidity in the form of highly liquid securities and cash to cover potential outflows during a stressed period. The liquidity risk management principles emphasize maintaining a viable contingency funding plan and appropriate asset-liability management. 

In terms of credit risk, Goldman Sachs employs a robust process for assessing and managing credit exposures, which includes monitoring compliance with established credit risk limits and utilizing credit risk mitigants. The firm conducts regular credit analyses and stress tests to evaluate potential losses from adverse market conditions. 

The firm’s capital management policy provides a framework for maintaining appropriate capital levels in both normal and stressed conditions, with an emphasis on ensuring that capital adequacy is aligned with the risks inherent in its business activities. The capital planning process incorporates stress scenarios to ensure that the firm remains adequately capitalized after experiencing severe stress events. 

Overall, Goldman Sachs’ operational risk management, liquidity risk management, and credit risk management processes are designed to enhance organizational resilience, enabling the firm to adapt and respond effectively to unexpected situations and external pressures while maintaining operational continuity and performance under pressure.

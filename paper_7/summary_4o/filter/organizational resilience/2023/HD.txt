The discussion provides an analysis of the company's financial condition and results of operations from management's perspective. We reported net sales of $152.7 billion in fiscal 2023, with net earnings of $15.1 billion. During fiscal 2023, we opened eight new stores in the U.S. and five in Mexico, resulting in a total store count of 2,335. Our inventory turnover ratio was 4.3 times at the end of fiscal 2023, reflecting operational flexibility and resource management. We generated $21.2 billion of cash flow from operations, which, along with cash on hand, was utilized for dividends and share repurchases. The decrease in return on invested capital (ROIC) was primarily driven by lower operating income and increased long-term debt. Net sales for fiscal 2023 decreased by $4.7 billion, or 3.0%, primarily reflecting a negative comparable sales environment driven by macroeconomic factors. The decrease in comparable customer transactions reflects the impact of consumer consumption trends and a higher interest rate environment. We experienced a decrease in gross profit margin, which reflects price stabilization and optimization of our inventory position. Our operating expenses increased due to deleverage from a negative comparable sales environment and wage investments for hourly associates. We believe our current cash position, cash flow generated from operations, and access to long-term debt capital markets should be sufficient for our operating requirements and to enable us to invest in the business. During fiscal 2023, we paid cash dividends of $8.4 billion and announced a 7.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend. We also invested approximately $3.2 billion back into our business in capital expenditures and $1.5 billion on acquisitions, enhancing our capabilities to serve customers. Our disciplined approach to capital allocation prioritizes investing in the business, followed by paying dividends, which reflects our strategic initiatives and resource allocation. We have a commercial paper program and back-up credit facilities that provide liquidity and support operational continuity. We issued $2.0 billion of senior notes for general corporate purposes, demonstrating our ability to adapt to financial conditions. Our aggregate remaining lease payment obligations and purchase obligations reflect our commitment to operational management and resource utilization. Cash flow generated from operations increased, driven by changes in working capital, which were influenced by inventory management and vendor payment terms. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires significant estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Our significant accounting policies and estimates are disclosed, emphasizing the importance of operational resilience in financial reporting. The valuation of our inventory is based on current market conditions, which reflects our adaptability to fluctuations in demand and customer preferences. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood of a material change in our estimates or assumptions, indicating stability in our operational practices.

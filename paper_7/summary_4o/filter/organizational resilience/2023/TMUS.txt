The objectives of our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include providing a narrative explanation of our financial condition, results of operations, and certain factors that may affect future results. Following the merger with Sprint, we initiated restructuring initiatives to realize cost efficiencies, which included contract termination costs and severance costs associated with the reduction of redundant processes. Our integration and decommissioning initiatives aimed to achieve merger synergies in network costs, which involved rationalization activities to identify duplicative networks and the decommissioning of certain small cell sites. We expect to incur all remaining restructuring and integration costs associated with the merger by the first half of 2024, with cash expenditures extending beyond that period. Macroeconomic trends may result in adverse impacts on our business, and we continue to monitor potential impacts, including economic recession and geopolitical risks. We have established a trajectory model of organizational resilience that focuses on how we project responses toward disruptive events and reconfigure trajectories in response to these events. Our operational management strategies are designed to maintain performance under pressure, ensuring operational continuity and adaptability in the face of environmental disruptions. We have implemented strategic initiatives to enhance our organizational capabilities, including the build-out of our nationwide 5G network, which is expected to improve our operational flexibility and responsiveness to customer needs. The integration of our networks and technology systems is a critical component of our strategic adaptation, allowing us to confront challenges and enhance our competitive advantage. We have also recognized the importance of inter-organizational collaboration and knowledge management in fostering organizational resilience, particularly in navigating complex situations and external pressures. Our commitment to resource allocation and management is reflected in our performance maintenance strategies, which aim to optimize operational resources and ensure financial stability. The merger-related costs have been excluded from our calculations of adjusted EBITDA, as these costs do not reflect our ongoing operating performance. We continue to assess the implications of our restructuring activities on organizational health and effectiveness, ensuring that we remain agile and capable of responding to unexpected situations. Our focus on strategic resilience is evident in our efforts to enhance organizational strength and coherence, enabling us to thrive in turbulent markets. The integration of acquired entities, such as Ka'ena Corporation, is expected to further bolster our resilience by expanding our customer base and service offerings. We anticipate that our future planning will be guided by a commitment to sustainability and proactive measures that enhance our organizational foresight and adaptability. The ongoing assessment of our operational performance and strategic initiatives will ensure that we remain well-positioned to navigate the complexities of the business environment and achieve our major objectives.

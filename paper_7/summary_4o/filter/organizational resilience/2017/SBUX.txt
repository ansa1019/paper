Our fiscal year ended on October 1, 2017, demonstrated the strength of our global business model and our ability to successfully make disciplined investments in our business and our partners. We continue to execute on our strategy of repositioning the EMEA segment to a predominantly licensed model, which reflects our adaptability to external pressures and market conditions. The success of our premium food offerings coupled with innovation across our coffee and tea beverage platforms drove the increase in comparable store sales, showcasing our operational flexibility and resilience in responding to customer needs. We anticipate continued growth through thoughtful long-term investments that create value and reward shareholders, which aligns with our major objectives of driving innovation and elevating the customer experience. Our strategic actions, including the pending transaction to acquire full ownership of our joint venture in East China, reflect our commitment to resource allocation and operational continuity in the face of disruptive events. We are in the process of exiting certain activities, including closing Teavana retail stores, which enables us to focus on businesses with the highest growth potential and greatest prospect for returns. The anticipated revenue growth in fiscal 2018 is expected to be driven by comparable store sales and the opening of approximately 2,300 net new Starbucks stores globally. Our capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $2.0 billion, primarily for investments in our new and existing stores and our supply chain. The combination of strong operational performance and prudent leveraging of our balance sheet will enable us to return significant value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We recognize the importance of maintaining our organizational health and resilience in navigating economic challenges, as evidenced by our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite external disturbances. Our financial condition and liquidity are actively managed to support our operational needs and strategic initiatives, ensuring we are well-positioned to confront future uncertainties. We have implemented risk management strategies to mitigate potential adverse impacts from commodity price fluctuations and foreign currency exchange rates, which are essential for maintaining our operational effectiveness. Our approach to managing market risks includes entering into hedging transactions, which reflects our commitment to resilience engineering and proactive measures in the face of market volatility. The strategic foresight demonstrated in our planning processes, including our focus on digital transformation and innovation, positions us to adapt to evolving market dynamics and sustain our competitive advantage. We believe that our ability to foresee and respond to complex situations will contribute to our organizational success and long-term viability in turbulent markets.

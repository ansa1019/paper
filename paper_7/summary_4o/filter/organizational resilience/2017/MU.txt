Our overall gross margin percentage increased due to strong market conditions that drove favorable pricing and manufacturing cost reductions, indicating our resilience in maintaining performance under pressure. We continuously evaluate alternatives for efficiently funding our capital expenditures and ongoing operations, which reflects our strategic management and resource allocation capabilities. Our ability to meet demand was due in part to increases in production, primarily from the ramp of capacity and improvements in product and process technology, including our transition to 3D NAND products, which illustrates our commitment to innovation and operational continuity. We must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies and R&D to support future growth and achieve operating efficiencies, which are essential for maintaining organizational health and effectiveness.

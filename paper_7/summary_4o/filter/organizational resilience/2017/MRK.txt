Merck & Co., Inc. experienced a network cyber-attack on June 27, 2017, which led to a disruption of its worldwide operations, including manufacturing, research, and sales operations. Despite this challenge, the company continued to fulfill orders and ship products, demonstrating its operational flexibility and resilience under adverse conditions. The cyber-attack had an unfavorable effect on sales in 2017 of approximately $260 million and resulted in additional manufacturing-related expenses. The company anticipates that the residual backlog of orders will further affect sales in 2018, highlighting the need for effective crisis management and recovery strategies. In September 2017, Hurricane Maria impacted Puerto Rico, where Merck has a manufacturing plant. The plant did not sustain substantial damage, and production activities resumed, although the company prepared to use alternative sources of power and water, reflecting its adaptability to environmental perturbations. Merck's strategic initiatives include augmenting its portfolio and pipeline with external innovation, which remains an important component of its overall strategy. The company entered into a global strategic oncology collaboration with AstraZeneca to co-develop and co-commercialize Lynparza, demonstrating inter-organizational collaboration as a resilience strategy. Merck's focus on innovation is evident as it continues to advance its late-stage pipeline, addressing unmet medical needs and adapting to changing market conditions. The company prioritizes resources to maximize opportunities for ongoing and upcoming product launches, indicating a proactive approach to resource allocation and future planning. In 2017, Merck achieved multiple regulatory milestones for Keytruda, reflecting its commitment to performance maintenance and operational continuity in the face of competitive pressures and market volatility. The company also recorded significant research and development expenses, reflecting its investment in innovation and resilience engineering to navigate complex situations and maintain organizational effectiveness. The termination of the joint venture with Sanofi Pasteur in December 2016 allowed Merck to record vaccine sales in European markets, further emphasizing its ability to reconfigure operations and respond to changing business environments. The companyâ€™s strong financial profile enables it to fund research and development, support in-line products, and maximize upcoming launches while providing significant cash returns to shareholders, underscoring its organizational strength and commitment to sustaining growth amidst challenges. Merck's approach to managing risks associated with foreign exchange and interest rates through various financial instruments demonstrates its strategic response to external pressures, ensuring system resilience and operational management. The company continues to evaluate its pipeline, focusing on candidates that can provide significant value, which reflects its organizational foresight and commitment to long-term growth and sustainability.

Our goal is to achieve sales growth at the high-end of the medical technology (medtech) industry and maintain our capital allocation strategy that prioritizes acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases. In 2017, we achieved reported net sales growth of 9.9%. We reported net earnings of $1,020 and net earnings per diluted share of $2.68. We continued our capital allocation strategy by investing in acquisitions, which reflects our commitment to innovation and operational flexibility. In December 2017, we announced a definitive merger agreement to acquire Entellus Medical, Inc., a high-growth global medical technology company focused on delivering superior patient and physician experiences. We expect the acquisition to close in February 2018. In August 2017, we initiated a voluntary product recall involving specific lots of our oral care products in response to a warning letter from the FDA regarding potential cross-contamination. We took immediate action by discontinuing business with the third-party supplier and resumed shipping oral care products in October, returning to full supply capacity by the end of 2017. This demonstrates our ability to adapt and recover from unexpected situations while maintaining operational continuity. Our research, development, and engineering expenses represented 6.3% of net sales in 2017, reflecting our ongoing commitment to service innovation and the development of new products. We believe that our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates. Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. We supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund our activities as necessary, which indicates our strategic response to resource allocation and financial management under varying conditions. Our cash position reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that considers liquidity management and economic factors. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs from various sources, including cash from operations and existing credit lines. We have existing credit facilities should additional funds be required. The establishment of our European regional headquarters has contributed to lower effective income tax rates, enhancing our organizational health and resilience. We are involved in various ongoing legal proceedings that could impact our financial position, but we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our estimates regarding the future recoverability of inventory costs and tax positions reflect our proactive measures in risk management and strategic foresight. We maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, which indicates our awareness of potential challenges in the market. Our financial statements include the operations of acquired businesses starting from the completion of the acquisition, demonstrating our commitment to organizational transformation and adaptation strategies. We perform annual impairment tests for goodwill, which requires considerable management judgment to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes, ensuring that we maintain organizational effectiveness and resilience in the face of potential disruptions.

We invest in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for serious diseases, focusing on developing and commercializing therapies for cystic fibrosis and advancing research and development programs in other diseases. Our ongoing research and development programs are conducted independently or in collaboration with third parties, which allows us to balance the risks inherent in drug development and may provide drug candidates that will form our pipeline in future years. We believe that pursuing research in diverse areas enhances our organizational resilience by allowing us to adapt to environmental perturbations and maintain operational flexibility. Our decision-making processes are influenced by the need to monitor the results of our discovery, research, clinical trials, and nonclinical studies, which frequently leads to abrupt changes in focus and priorities as new information becomes available. We actively identify, prevent, and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems, promoting a culture of compliance that supports our organizational health. Our collaboration arrangements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies enhance our research capabilities and provide strategic tools for navigating external pressures. We are committed to fostering scientific innovation and adapting our strategies to meet customer needs, which is essential for maintaining performance under pressure. The successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain and subject to various risks, including regulatory compliance and market dynamics. Our ability to respond effectively to these challenges is critical for organizational survival and success. We continuously evaluate our drug development programs in light of new data and scientific insights, which is fundamental to our resilience strategies. Our financial results and commercial prospects can be significantly affected by regulatory delays or approvals, necessitating a proactive approach to risk management and resource allocation. We maintain substantial resources to support our operations and strategic initiatives, including collaborations that enhance our capabilities and resource generation. Our commitment to research and development is reflected in our substantial and consistent investment in internal research activities, which is crucial for our organizational effectiveness. We expect that cash flows from product sales will be our primary source of liquidity, and we are actively managing our capital structure to strengthen our long-term liquidity profile. Our strategic planning involves assessing the impact of external disturbances and preparing for potential disruptions, ensuring that we remain adaptable in a turbulent market environment. The consolidation and deconsolidation of variable interest entities reflect our ongoing evaluation of our collaborations and the associated risks, which is integral to our operational management and resilience. We are committed to maintaining a culture of learning and adaptability, which is essential for navigating complex situations and ensuring our organizational evolution in response to market demands and technological advancements.

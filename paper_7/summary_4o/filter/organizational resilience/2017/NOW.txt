Servicenow is a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions that help customers improve service quality and reduce costs while scaling and automating their businesses. We continue to invest in the development of our services, infrastructure, and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth. Our subscription revenues increased significantly during the year ended December 31, 2017, driven by upsells and an increase in customer count, reflecting our adaptability to changing customer needs and market conditions. We expect subscription revenues to grow in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to add new customers and upsell to existing customers. Our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues, demonstrating our operational flexibility in diverse markets. The increase in customer agreements, particularly in the quarter ended December 31, is primarily a result of the terms of our commission plans, which incentivize our direct sales force to meet their annual quotas, highlighting our strategic response to market dynamics. We have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements for our services, indicating our awareness of external pressures and customer buying patterns typical in the software industry. Our operating expenses have increased due to headcount growth and related expenses to support our expansion, reflecting our resource allocation strategies to enhance organizational capabilities. We have also invested in research and development to improve the existing functionality of our services and develop new applications to fill market needs, which is essential for maintaining competitive advantage. The gross profit percentage for our subscription revenues increased due to improved data center utilization and economies of scale, demonstrating our ability to manage operational resources effectively under varying conditions. We recognize the importance of knowledge management and continuous learning in enhancing our organizational intelligence and resilience. Our professional services revenues increased due to an increase in the services provided to our growing customer base, indicating our commitment to customer success and operational continuity. The impact of foreign currency movements on our revenues and expenses highlights the need for effective risk management strategies in a volatile market environment. We expect our current cash and cash equivalents balance and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, reflecting our proactive measures in financial management. Our approach to revenue recognition and deferred commissions demonstrates our strategic foresight in aligning financial practices with business objectives. We continue to evaluate our operational strategies and market conditions to ensure we are well-positioned to confront future challenges and capitalize on opportunities for growth.

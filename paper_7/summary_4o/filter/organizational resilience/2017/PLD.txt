During the year ended December 31, 2017, operating fundamentals remained strong for our owned and managed portfolio, ending the year with occupancy of 97.2%. The operating fundamentals in the markets in which we operate continue to be strong, which has driven rents higher, kept occupancies high, and fueled development activity. We evaluate our business operations based on the net operating income (NOI) of our two operating segments: real estate operations and strategic capital. NOI by segment is a non-GAAP financial measure that helps management and investors understand the core operations of our real estate assets. We consider NOI by segment to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance. The change in real estate operations NOI during these periods was impacted by various factors, including increased occupancy and positive rent rate growth. The impact from acquisitions in 2016 was primarily due to the acquisition of the real estate assets and operating platform of KTR Capital Partners, which generated additional net revenues. During these periods, NOI increased as developments stabilized, reflecting our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and maintain operational flexibility. We also experienced contribution and disposition activity, which increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to the contribution of operating properties to our co-investment ventures. Our strategic capital segment includes revenues from asset and property management and other fees for services performed, which fluctuate based on the size of co-investment ventures under management and the transactional activity in the ventures. We allocate the costs of our property management functions to the strategic capital segment and to the real estate operations segment based on the square footage of the relative portfolios. We believe that our ability to generate cash from operating activities, distributions from our co-investment ventures, contributions, and dispositions of properties is adequate to meet our anticipated future development, acquisition, operating, debt service, dividend, and distribution requirements. We expect to fund our cash needs principally from fees earned for services performed on behalf of the co-investment ventures, proceeds from the disposition of properties, and proceeds from contributions of properties to current or future co-investment ventures. Our liquidity and capital resources overview indicates that we are well-positioned to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations. We maintain a focus on maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions, which is critical for our organizational resilience. Our ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive changes is essential for our survival and growth in a turbulent market. We continuously assess our operating performance using a "same store" analysis, which allows us to evaluate the growth or decline in each property's rental revenues without regard to one-time items. Our approach to managing our owned and managed portfolio reflects our commitment to operational continuity and organizational effectiveness, ensuring that we can adapt to complex situations and maintain performance under pressure.

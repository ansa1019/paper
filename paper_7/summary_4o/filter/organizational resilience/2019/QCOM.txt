In fiscal 2019, we entered into settlement agreements with Apple and its contract manufacturers to dismiss all outstanding litigation between the parties, which included a multi-year chipset supply agreement. These developments reflect our strategic initiatives to enhance stability for the long term, as we adapt to external pressures and competitive dynamics within the industry. Our revenues have historically fluctuated based on consumer demand for devices, as well as on the timing of customer/licensee device launches and innovation cycles, which underscores the importance of operational flexibility and resource allocation in maintaining performance under pressure. We expect our business to continue to be impacted by industry dynamics, including increased concentration of device share among a few companies, which may exacerbate the negative impact on our financial results. 

The adoption of new revenue recognition guidance required us to estimate and recognize licensing revenues in the period in which associated sales occur, reflecting our adaptability to changing regulatory environments and market conditions. We also recognize that unfavorable resolutions of legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, emphasizing the need for effective risk management and strategic response mechanisms. Our cost plan, designed to align our cost structure with long-term margin targets, involved targeted actions across our businesses to reduce annual costs, demonstrating our resilience strategies in the face of operational challenges.

We continue to invest significant resources in research and development to drive innovation and maintain our competitive advantage, particularly in the development of 5G technologies, which we believe will empower a new era of smartphones and connected devices. This investment is critical for sustaining and growing our business, as it enables us to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform our operations to emerge stronger from challenging situations. 

Our historical trends were impacted by disputes with Apple and its contract manufacturers, which were settled in April 2019, and we expect to begin recording revenues for new chipset models under our recently announced multi-year chipset agreement with Apple in the second half of fiscal 2020. The ongoing negotiations with Huawei regarding royalty payments further illustrate the complexities of our operational environment and the need for effective inter-organizational collaboration. 

As we look forward, we anticipate that the growth of device share by Chinese OEMs and the competitive landscape will continue to challenge our business model. We remain committed to leveraging our internal knowledge and capabilities to navigate these complexities, ensuring that we maintain organizational health and effectiveness. Our approach to managing these challenges is multifaceted, focusing on strategic foresight, operational continuity, and the development of collaborative networks to enhance our resilience in a turbulent market.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, operating fundamentals remained strong for our O&M portfolio, indicating a level of operational flexibility and resilience in the face of market conditions. Our occupancy decreased to 96.5% at December 31, 2019, as compared to 97.5% at December 31, 2018, due to our focus on rental rate growth, which reflects our ability to adapt to changing market demands. We generated net proceeds of $2.4 billion and realized net gains of $719 million, primarily from contributions of properties to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, demonstrating our capability to reconfigure resources effectively in response to market opportunities. The strategic capital segment includes revenues from asset and property management, which fluctuate due to changes in the size of portfolios through acquisitions and dispositions, indicating a dynamic approach to resource allocation and risk management. We evaluate our business operations based on the NOI of our two operating segments, which helps management understand our operational effectiveness and resilience strategies. The operating fundamentals in the markets we operate continue to be strong, which has increased rents and kept occupancies high, reflecting our organizational strength and adaptability to external pressures. Our development portfolio, including properties under development and pre-stabilized properties, was 50.0% leased and expected to be completed before December 2021, showcasing our commitment to maintaining operational continuity and performance under pressure. We believe that reviewing our fundamentals on an O&M basis allows management to understand the entire impact on the financial statements, which is crucial for sustaining organizational health. Our liquidity position, with total liquidity of $4.8 billion, including unrestricted cash balances, provides a buffer against potential adverse conditions, enhancing our resilience in turbulent markets. We consider our ability to generate cash from operating activities, distributions from our co-investment ventures, and available financing sources to be adequate to meet our anticipated future development and operational needs, which is essential for organizational survival. The formation of new co-investment ventures and strategic partnerships reflects our proactive measures in adapting to market changes and enhancing our competitive advantage. Our approach to capital expenditures and leasing costs on properties in our operating portfolio indicates a focus on long-term sustainability and resourcefulness. We manage our business and compensate our executives based on the same store results of our O&M portfolio, which underscores our commitment to performance maintenance and organizational effectiveness. The ability to foresee and confront sudden disruptive changes is integral to our strategy, allowing us to flourish despite challenges. Our operational management practices, including the assessment of carrying values of long-lived assets and the evaluation of market conditions, reflect a systemic perspective on organizational resilience. We continuously engage in strategic planning and resource management to ensure that we can adapt to complex situations and maintain our operational integrity.

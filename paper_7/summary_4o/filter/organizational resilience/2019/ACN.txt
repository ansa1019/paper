The provided text primarily discusses net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and does not directly address "IT capability" or related concepts. However, it can be inferred that the financial performance of subsidiaries, such as Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. and Avanade Inc., may reflect the underlying effectiveness of their IT capabilities in managing resources and processes. The coordination of financial activities and the management of equity interests could imply a reliance on robust IT systems for accurate information processing and reporting. While the text does not explicitly mention IT capabilities, the financial structures and organizational relationships described may suggest an implicit connection to the broader themes of resource management and operational efficiency that are essential for leveraging IT capabilities in support of business strategies. Thus, the operational context hints at the importance of effective IT governance and resource allocation in achieving organizational goals and enhancing firm performance.

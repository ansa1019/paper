Mastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses, and other organizations worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks. We make payments easier and more efficient by providing a wide range of payment solutions and services using our family of well-known brands. Our payment solutions offer customers choice and flexibility and are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments system. Our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions. We guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions between our customers, and the risk of loss on these guarantees may be driven by regional or global economic conditions, including the health of the financial institutions in a country or region. Our existing cash, cash equivalents, investment securities balances, and cash flow generating capabilities are sufficient to satisfy our future operating cash needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations and potential obligations. We rely on existing liquidity, cash generated from operations, and access to capital to fund our global operations, credit and settlement exposure, capital expenditures, investments in our business, and current and potential obligations. We continue to operate and serve our Venezuelan issuers, acquirers, merchants, and account holders with our products and services despite the challenges faced due to foreign exchange regulations. Our net revenue increased 13%, or 16% on a currency-neutral basis in 2019 versus the prior year, primarily due to an increase in transactions and dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands. The components of net revenue were driven by domestic assessments, transaction processing, and other payment-related products and services. We have invested in strategic initiatives to enhance our operational flexibility and adaptability in response to changing market conditions. Our operational management includes preparing for potential disruptions and ensuring business continuity through effective resource allocation and risk management strategies. The effective management of our operational resources and strategic response mechanisms is crucial for maintaining organizational resilience in the face of external pressures and environmental disruptions. We have completed acquisitions to strengthen our capabilities and enhance our service offerings, which are essential for sustaining competitive advantage and responding to customer needs. Our financial results reflect our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite the presence of adversity, demonstrating our commitment to organizational health and operational continuity. We have also engaged in proactive measures to mitigate risks associated with currency devaluation and legal proceedings, underscoring our focus on maintaining system integrity and performance under pressure. The continued investment in our organizational practices and collaborative networks is vital for fostering resilience and ensuring long-term success in a turbulent market environment.

During the third quarter of 2019, we completed the acquisition of BTG plc, which was composed of three key businesses, enhancing our operational capabilities and resilience in the market. This acquisition was integrated into our peripheral interventions division, demonstrating our strategic response to external pressures and the need for operational flexibility. Our financial condition reflects a positive adjustment under challenging conditions, with net sales increasing to $10.735 billion in 2019, driven by operational growth and strategic initiatives that foster resilience. We have established controls and procedures to escalate enterprise-level issues, including cybersecurity matters, to ensure organizational health and maintain performance under pressure. Our commitment to research and development is evident as we invest in meaningful projects across our businesses to sustain a pipeline of new products, which is critical for adapting to market changes and enhancing our competitive advantage. The integration of BTG's interventional medicine business is expected to strengthen our resilience strategies by providing complementary technologies in the areas of venous disease and interventional oncology. Our operational management practices include ongoing cost optimization initiatives that support resource allocation and enhance organizational effectiveness. We assess our performance period over period to identify trends that inform our strategic planning and resource generation efforts. The restructuring initiatives we have undertaken are designed to improve our operational continuity and address localized strain within our operations. We are committed to maintaining our internal control over financial reporting, which is essential for ensuring the integrity of our operations and facilitating effective decision-making. Our liquidity plans are subject to various risks, including macroeconomic conditions and adverse litigation outcomes, which could impact our ability to execute our business plans. We have established a framework for managing these risks, including a focus on crisis management and preparedness for unexpected situations. Our focus on emerging markets reflects our future orientation and the strategic foresight necessary to navigate environmental turbulence. We continuously evaluate our organizational dynamics and capabilities to ensure we can confront challenges and adapt to complex situations.

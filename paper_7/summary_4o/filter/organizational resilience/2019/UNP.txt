The railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our one reportable business segment. Despite significant operational changes in 2019, we remained committed to the safety of our employees, customers, and the public, focusing on identifying and managing risk and training our employees as their work environment changed. Our operational changes were impacted by significant weather events, including heavy snowfall and flooding, which disrupted network operations. However, we remained focused on the implementation of unified plan 2020, aimed at operating a safe, reliable, and efficient railroad by increasing service reliability, reducing variability in network operations, and improving resource utilization costs. We have seen improvements in key performance indicators year-over-year, including asset utilization and productivity metrics, indicating our ability to adapt and respond to environmental perturbations. Our efforts to reduce "car touches" on our network have led to terminal rationalization, which is designed to enhance operational flexibility and efficiency. We expect uncertainties in various markets to continue, with external pressures such as fluctuating natural gas prices and weather conditions impacting demand. Our capital plan includes investments intended to improve productivity and operational efficiency, which are critical for maintaining organizational resilience. We anticipate that our strategic initiatives will better align our management structure and decision-making processes to be more agile and responsive to customer needs. Our focus on safety and risk assessment strategies allows us to identify and mitigate potential hazards, contributing to our organizational health and performance maintenance. We are committed to utilizing data to enhance our operational practices and improve service delivery. Our financial results reflect a strong operating income, driven by productivity initiatives and improved pricing, despite challenges in certain markets. We believe our ability to generate cash without additional external financing is vital for sustaining our operations under adverse conditions. Our liquidity management strategies, including access to credit facilities and capital markets, are designed to ensure we can meet foreseeable cash requirements. The ongoing implementation of unified plan 2020 and G55+0 initiatives will further enhance our operational capabilities and resilience in the face of market volatility. We are committed to balancing investments in our network infrastructure and terminal capacity to meet customer demand and capitalize on opportunities for long-term growth. Our approach to safety, risk management, and operational continuity is integral to our organizational resilience, enabling us to confront challenges and maintain performance under pressure.

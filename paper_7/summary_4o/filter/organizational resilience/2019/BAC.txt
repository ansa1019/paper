The corporation's risk management framework emphasizes the importance of maintaining a strong and flexible financial position to withstand challenging economic conditions and take advantage of growth opportunities. The board and executive management are responsible for overseeing the corporation's risk appetite, which indicates the amount of capital, earnings, or liquidity the corporation is willing to put at risk to achieve strategic objectives. This risk appetite is formally articulated in a risk appetite statement that includes both qualitative components and quantitative limits. The corporation's strategic plan is aligned with its risk appetite, capital plan, and liquidity requirements, addressing strategic risks that may arise from incorrect assumptions about external or internal factors, inappropriate business plans, or ineffective execution. 

The corporation conducts capital scenario management and stress forecasting to understand balance sheet, earnings, and capital sensitivities to various economic and market scenarios, including severe conditions. These stress forecasts provide insights into the potential impacts of the corporation's risk profile on its financial resiliency. Contingency plans are developed to prepare for adverse economic, financial, or market stress, including capital contingency plans that enable the corporation to access funding sources and reduce risk through various strategies. 

Operational risk management is critical, as it encompasses the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes, people, and systems, or from external events. The corporation's operational risk management includes a comprehensive information security program designed to protect against cybersecurity risks, which can impact the integrity of operations and sensitive data. 

The corporation also emphasizes the importance of adaptability and operational flexibility in response to environmental perturbations and unexpected situations. This includes the ability to reconfigure resources and deploy them effectively to meet changing customer needs and market demands. The corporation's approach to risk management incorporates a systemic perspective, recognizing the interconnectedness of various risks and the need for strategic initiatives that foster resilience. 

The management of credit risk involves ongoing assessments of borrower profiles and the implementation of proactive measures to mitigate losses, particularly in the consumer and commercial portfolios. The corporation employs a variety of tools to monitor and manage credit risk, including statistical models that evaluate historical loss experience and current economic conditions. 

In summary, the corporation's resilience strategies focus on maintaining operational continuity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions through effective resource management, strategic foresight, and a commitment to learning and adaptation. This multifaceted approach is essential for navigating the complexities of the financial landscape and ensuring long-term organizational success.

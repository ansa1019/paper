In 2019, we continued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities, which include helping marketers use our products to connect with consumers and making our ads more relevant and effective. We invested based on company priorities that we believe will further our mission, including making progress on major social issues facing the internet, building new experiences that improve lives, supporting businesses that rely on our services, and communicating transparently about our role in the world. We anticipate that additional investments in our data center capacity, network infrastructure, and office facilities will drive expense growth in 2020. Trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we can show and the value of our ads to marketers. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products across our platforms, and the number of ads delivered increased significantly due to user engagement. We expect future advertising revenue growth to be determined by the number of ads delivered and price. Our cost of revenue increased due to operational expenses related to data centers and technical infrastructure, as well as higher costs associated with consumer hardware devices and traffic acquisition. We plan to continue hiring technical employees and increasing our investment in research and development initiatives to support growth. We are involved in legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business, and we evaluate developments regularly, accruing a liability when we believe a loss is probable. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, and the outcome of these matters is inherently uncertain. We review goodwill for impairment at least annually and assess long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Our liquidity and capital resources are primarily sourced from cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2019, we had significant cash reserves, which we believe will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future. We have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented, and we continue to monitor our financial condition and operational performance under various market conditions. Our organizational practices and strategic initiatives are designed to enhance our resilience in the face of external pressures and environmental disruptions, ensuring that we can adapt and maintain performance under challenging conditions. We recognize the importance of operational flexibility and resource allocation in achieving our major objectives and sustaining organizational health. The complexities of our business environment necessitate a proactive approach to risk management and strategic adaptation, allowing us to confront unexpected situations and support our growth trajectory.

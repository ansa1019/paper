Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. The investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one's career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Economic conditions, challenges, and risks indicate that the markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. Our research and development expenses increased, driven by investments in cloud and AI engineering, indicating a commitment to innovation and adaptation. We recognize that our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Our ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change is crucial for survival, growth, and flourishing. The commercial cloud revenue increased significantly, reflecting our ability to adapt to market demands and customer needs. We have recast certain prior period commercial cloud metrics to provide a comparable view of our commercial cloud business performance, demonstrating our focus on maintaining operational flexibility and coherence amidst external pressures. Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses, and changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses, highlighting the need for effective risk management and adaptability. Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in certain periods, which requires strategic planning and operational continuity. We continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, which reflects our commitment to resilience strategies and mechanisms for recovery and adaptation. The transition tax imposed by the TCJA has required us to adapt our financial strategies, demonstrating our ability to manage external pressures and maintain organizational health. We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, which is essential for sustaining organizational resilience. Our fair value processes include controls designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded, which is part of our broader risk assessment and management strategy. The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty, requiring us to evaluate the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make reasonable estimates of potential losses. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate, reflecting our proactive measures in managing potential risks.

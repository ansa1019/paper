Stryker is committed to internal innovation to develop products and services that improve outcomes and deliver greater cost savings and efficiencies. Our success depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day. We believe our success in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate depends to a large degree on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products. We express this through our mission statement: "together with our customers, we are driven to make healthcare better." We achieved sales growth of 7.3% in 2014, in line with our ongoing goal to grow organic sales at the high-end of the medtech industry. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes investments in acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses, which supports our operational flexibility and adaptability in the face of market changes. We believe that our increased presence in Europe will strengthen our brand, support the growth of our global business, and provide operational efficiencies. Our acquisitions, including those of Small Bone Innovations, Berchtold Holding, and Patient Safety Technologies, are designed to enhance our capabilities and address customer needs effectively. Our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and ready access to capital markets at competitive rates. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs from various sources, including cash from operations and existing credit lines. We continually evaluate our receivables, particularly in regions with economic challenges, and believe our current reserves related to receivables are adequate. Our operational management strategies include maintaining debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating cash flow expectations and overall cost of capital. We have strong short-term and long-term debt ratings, which should enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due. Our commitment to research, development, and engineering is evident in our increased spending levels, driven by the impact of acquisitions and our continued investment in new technologies. We manage capital spending to support our business growth, focusing on integration of acquisitions, capacity expansion, and innovation. Our operational continuity is supported by a robust cash management strategy that considers liquidity management, economic factors, and tax considerations. We have established a liability for uncertain income tax positions and are involved in various ongoing legal proceedings that may impact our financial position. Our organizational practices emphasize resilience through strategic initiatives that enhance our operational capabilities and prepare us for unexpected situations. We are committed to learning and adapting to complex situations, ensuring that we can confront external pressures and maintain our performance under challenging conditions. The multifaceted nature of our business requires us to continuously assess risks and opportunities, enabling us to reconfigure our strategies and resources to thrive in a turbulent market environment.

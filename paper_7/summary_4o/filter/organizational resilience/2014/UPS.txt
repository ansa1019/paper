The broad portfolio of product offerings and the flexibilities inherent in our transportation network have helped us adapt to changing trends. We have continued to undertake several initiatives to improve the flexibility and capacity in our delivery network, improve yield management, and increase operational efficiency and contain costs across all segments. The continued deployment of technology improvements should increase our network capacity and improve operational efficiency, flexibility, and reliability. We have adjusted our transportation network and utilized new or expanded operating facilities to improve time-in-transit for shipments in each region. In response to the uneven nature of economic growth worldwide, we have adjusted our air capacity and cost structure in our transportation network to better match the prevailing volume mix levels. These adjustments are part of our strategy to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations. The combination of these factors has allowed us to maintain performance under pressure and improve our operational management. We have continued to adjust our air and ground networks to better match higher volume levels and utilize technology to increase package sorting and delivery efficiency. These improvements have enabled us to process increased volume at a faster rate than the increase in average daily aircraft block hours and vehicle miles driven. We have also elected to operate on one additional day during the fourth quarter to further improve service levels. However, the significant variability in package volume during the holiday shipping season resulted in a sub-optimized transportation network and a reduction in productivity. We have experienced higher employee compensation costs, largely due to an increase in average daily union labor hours, union contractual wage rate increases, and increased employee healthcare expenses. The increase in labor hours was driven by volume growth, additional overtime, and training hours during the holiday shipping season, as well as adverse weather conditions. We have incurred higher expenses associated with outside contract carriers due to volume growth and service performance issues. These cost increases were partially offset by a reduction in workers' compensation expense due to actuarial adjustments attributable to operational safety and claims management initiatives. We have continued to implement network efficiency and productivity improvements, which have allowed us to process increased volume at a faster rate than the increase in average daily union labor hours and aircraft block hours. The ongoing adjustments to our operational practices and resource allocation reflect our commitment to maintaining organizational resilience in the face of external pressures and environmental perturbations. We believe that these strategic initiatives enhance our organizational capabilities and contribute to our overall effectiveness and adaptability in a turbulent market environment.

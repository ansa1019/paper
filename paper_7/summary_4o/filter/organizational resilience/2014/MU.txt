The following discussion contains trend information and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from our historical results and those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to, those identified in risk factors. We have entered into various restructure activities to optimize operations, improve efficiency, and increase our focus on core memory operations. In connection with the MMJ acquisition, we recorded net assets and a gain on the transaction, which included a significant increase in our operational capabilities and market position. Our management believes that to develop new product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities, and capital equipment. We are continuously evaluating alternatives for efficiently financing our capital expenditures and ongoing operations. Our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite the presence of adversity is reflected in our operational flexibility and strategic response to market demands. We expect that SG&A expenses will approximate a certain range for the first quarter of 2015, indicating our focus on maintaining organizational health and performance under pressure. Our process technology R&D efforts are focused primarily on the development of successively smaller line-width process technologies designed to facilitate our transition to next-generation memory products. The MMJ acquisition has significantly contributed to our sales growth and operational improvements, enhancing our competitive advantage in the market. Our overall gross margin percentage improved due to manufacturing cost reductions and higher average selling prices, demonstrating our adaptability to changing market conditions. We believe that the integration of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures will further enhance our resilience strategies. The transition of production at one of our wafer fabrication facilities from DRAM to NAND flash is substantially complete, reflecting our commitment to reconfiguring operations in response to market shifts. Our management continues to evaluate future financial performance to determine whether such performance is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of valuation allowances. The restructuring of our debt has been aimed at reducing dilution and improving our financial position, which is essential for maintaining operational continuity. We are in negotiations regarding the extension of the Inotera supply agreement, which is critical for our resource allocation and operational management. Our commitment to investing in R&D and manufacturing technologies is vital for sustaining our organizational capabilities and ensuring resilience against external pressures. The MMJ group's products include mobile DRAM targeted to mobile phones and tablets, indicating our focus on customer needs and market demands. We are continuously adapting our strategies to ensure that we can confront and benefit from sudden disruptive changes, thereby enhancing our organizational resilience and ability to flourish in turbulent markets.

In fiscal 2015, we continued to generate strong cash flows, allowing us to return value to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases while reinvesting in our business by adding new stores, remodeling existing ones, and strengthening our infrastructure to support our next level of growth. Our fiscal 2015 pre-tax margin was 12.2%, reflecting a slight increase compared to fiscal 2014, indicating operational flexibility in managing costs. The increase in same store sales was driven by increases in the value of the average transaction and customer traffic, demonstrating our adaptability to changing market conditions. We believe that unfavorable weather in many regions negatively impacted sales during certain quarters, highlighting the need for effective crisis management strategies to mitigate external pressures. Our segment profit margin remained flat at 14.6%, supported by improvements in merchandise margin and reductions in administrative costs, which are critical for maintaining organizational health and resilience. We have a reserve for the remaining future obligations of operations we have closed, sold, or otherwise disposed of, which reflects our proactive measures in managing resource constraints and ensuring operational continuity. Our liquidity and capital resources remain robust, with net cash provided by operating activities increasing year-over-year, indicating our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity. We expect to spend approximately $975 million on capital expenditures in fiscal 2016, which includes investments in offices and distribution centers to support growth, demonstrating our commitment to strategic adaptation and resilience. The change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a favorable impact on cash flows, showcasing our effective resource management and operational agility. We also plan to repurchase approximately $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2016, reflecting our strategic response to market conditions and commitment to shareholder value. Our segment profit increased significantly, driven by expense leverage on same store sales, which is indicative of our organizational capabilities to navigate complex situations and enhance performance under pressure. The increase in segment profit margin for our homegoods segment was primarily due to expense leverage on same store sales and an increase in merchandise margins, further illustrating our resilience strategies in adapting to customer needs and market demands. We have also entered into a lease agreement for the construction and occupancy of a new home office facility, which is part of our strategic initiatives to enhance operational efficiency and support future growth. Overall, our financial performance reflects a multifaceted approach to maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions, ensuring organizational survival and success in a turbulent market environment.

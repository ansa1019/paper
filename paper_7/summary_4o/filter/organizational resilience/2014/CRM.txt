We are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions, focusing on customer relationship management. Our mission is to help customers transform into "customer companies" by empowering them to connect with their customers in new ways. Key elements of our strategy include strengthening our market-leading solutions, extending distribution into new categories, and expanding strategic relationships with existing customers. To achieve our objectives, we must address factors such as customer willingness to migrate to cloud services, service availability, performance, security, and successful integration of acquired businesses and technologies. We continue to invest in our infrastructure to support growth, including expanding data center capacity and hiring additional personnel. Our research and development efforts focus on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, and enhancing the functionality and security of our offerings. We have increased our headcount significantly to meet the demand for our services, which facilitates the adoption of our service offerings. Our attrition rate has remained consistent, reflecting our investment in customer programs and initiatives that help maintain customer retention. We expect to continue investing in marketing and sales to build brand awareness and attract new customers. Our operating segments are evaluated regularly by our chief operating decision maker, who assesses performance on a consolidated basis. We derive revenues primarily from subscription fees for accessing our cloud services and related professional services. Our subscription contracts are typically non-cancelable, and we recognize revenues ratably over the contract terms. We have observed a significant increase in subscription and support revenues, driven by new business and upgrades from existing customers. Our cost of revenues includes expenses related to hosting our services, providing support, and employee-related costs. We continue to invest in our enterprise cloud computing services to enhance our capabilities and maintain operational flexibility. Our marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost, reflecting our commitment to expanding our customer base and increasing penetration within existing accounts. We regularly evaluate acquisitions and investment opportunities to expand our service offerings and maintain competitive advantage. The seasonal nature of our business affects our billing patterns, with our fourth quarter historically being our strongest for new business and renewals. We expect to continue making investments in our infrastructure and technology to support our growth and adapt to changing market conditions. Our strategic initiatives include enhancing our operational management and crisis response capabilities to ensure resilience in the face of external pressures and environmental disruptions. We are focused on maintaining our organizational health and effectiveness while navigating the complexities of the competitive landscape. Our approach to resource management and allocation is designed to optimize performance under pressure and ensure sustainability in turbulent markets. We recognize the importance of collaboration networks and inter-organizational relationships in enhancing our resilience strategies and overall organizational success.

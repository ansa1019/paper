During fiscal 2014, we reported financial results consistent with the continued execution of our long-term plans for our two strategic growth areas, digital media and digital marketing, while continuing to market and license a broad portfolio of products and solutions. We believe that investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products. Our subscription revenue is derived primarily from fees we charge for our subscription and hosted service offerings, which we recognize ratably over the term of agreements with our customers. We expect our subscription revenue will continue to increase as a result of our investments in new SaaS and subscription models, which will increase the amount of recurring revenue we generate as a percentage of our total revenue. We are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our digital marketing segment, and our Adobe Marketing Cloud includes solutions addressing the expanding needs of marketers. The transition to a subscription-based model has transformed our business, enabling more predictable revenue and operational flexibility. We have established a trajectory model of organizational resilience that focuses on how actors project temporal trajectories of responses toward disruptive events and reconfigure these trajectories toward the ensuing future. Our strategies include increasing the value that users receive and targeted promotions to attract past customers and potential users. We continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration, and purchase of subscriptions to our Creative Cloud offering. The increase in our digital media annual recurring revenue (ARR) demonstrates the progress we have made with the transformation of our business to a more recurring, ratable, and predictable revenue model. We also believe that the assumptions, judgments, and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business combinations, and goodwill impairment have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, reflecting our capacity to adapt and respond to changes in the business environment. Our financial performance indicates a strong adoption of our subscription offerings, which has resulted in a significant increase in our ARR. The resilience strategies we employ, including our focus on operational continuity and the ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions, are critical to maintaining our competitive advantage. We have also seen increased customer adoption of term-based licensing, which has resulted in larger customer engagements and more predictable revenue. Our ongoing assessment of market conditions and strategic initiatives supports our ability to navigate external pressures and maintain organizational health. We continue to evaluate our assumptions and estimates regularly, which is essential for effective risk management and ensuring our operational effectiveness in the face of potential adversities.

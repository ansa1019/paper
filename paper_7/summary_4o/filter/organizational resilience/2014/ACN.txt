The provided text does not contain explicit references to "IT capability" or related concepts such as information technology resources, business transformation, or operational efficiency. It primarily discusses net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and does not address any aspects of IT capabilities, strategic resource allocation, or the coordination of a firmâ€™s assets and internal processes. However, the context of financial performance and organizational structure may imply an underlying framework where IT capabilities could play a role in enhancing business operations and decision-making processes. The absence of direct mentions of IT capability limits the ability to extract specific insights related to the evolving nature of IT resources and their impact on business strategies and performance outcomes.

In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, our workforce has had and continues in most instances to spend a significant amount of time working from home, which reflects our organizational flexibility in response to external pressures. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations, and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, indicating the need for effective risk assessment and adaptation strategies. While we and our partners have resumed productions and related operations in many parts of the world, our ability to produce content remains affected by the pandemic, demonstrating the challenges of maintaining operational continuity under adverse conditions. We anticipate that actions taken by governments around the world to contain COVID-19 will continue to negatively impact business activity across the globe, highlighting the importance of crisis management and preparedness in maintaining organizational health. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required, which underscores our commitment to resilience strategies that prioritize the interests of our employees, customers, partners, and stockholders. The increase in operating margin is due primarily to increased revenues and decreased marketing costs, coupled with cost of revenues, technology and development, and general and administrative costs growing at a slower rate compared to the increase in revenues, illustrating our operational management capabilities in navigating complex situations. Our ability to obtain financing will depend on our development efforts, business plans, operating performance, and the condition of the capital markets, reflecting the interconnectedness of our organizational dynamics and external economic factors. We expect to continue to significantly increase our investments in global content, particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity and necessitate strategic planning and resource allocation. The timing and magnitude of future capital allocation may depend on our development efforts and operating performance, indicating a proactive approach to managing resource needs and ensuring organizational survival. Our business model is subscription-based, and we recognize content assets as "content assets, net" on the consolidated balance sheets, which requires considerable management judgment and reflects our organizational learning processes. The increase in technology and development expenses was primarily due to a rise in personnel-related costs to support increased production activity and improvements in our streaming service, demonstrating our commitment to innovation and adaptation in a turbulent market. We believe that cash flows from operations, available funds, and access to financing sources will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next twelve months, which is indicative of our organizational resilience in maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

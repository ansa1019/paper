In 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic affected Abbott's diversified health care businesses in various ways. Some businesses performed at the levels required to successfully meet new demands, while others faced challenges. Abbott mobilized its teams across multiple fronts to develop and launch new diagnostic tests for COVID-19, demonstrating operational flexibility and adaptability in response to disruptive events. The pandemic negatively impacted routine core diagnostic testing volumes and the number of cardiovascular and neuromodulation procedures performed globally, which reduced demand for Abbott's cardiovascular and neuromodulation devices. The extent of the impact and the timing of recovery depended on the progression of COVID-19 cases in specific regions. Abbott is continually implementing business continuity plans in the face of the pandemic, ensuring operational continuity and maintaining its ability to absorb strain while preserving functioning despite adversity. The company was generally exempt from governmental orders requiring businesses to cease operations due to the critical nature of its products and services. Abbott took aggressive steps to limit exposure and enhance the safety of facilities for its employees, reflecting a commitment to organizational health and resilience strategies. The unpredictability of the pandemic's duration and impact on business, financial condition, or results of operations remains uncertain. Despite these challenges, Abbott's sales growth over the last three years reflects volume growth due to the introduction of new products across various businesses. The company has focused on driving market adoption and geographic expansion of its Alinity suite of diagnostics instruments, which enhances operational management and strategic initiatives. Abbott's nutritional and diabetes care businesses were the least affected by the pandemic, indicating resilience in these segments. The company has also recorded improvements in operating margins, driven by sales volume increases in its rapid and molecular diagnostics businesses. In 2021, Abbott will continue to focus on meeting the demand for COVID-19 tests and invest in product development areas that provide opportunities for sustainable growth. The company plans to expand its market position in various areas, including diabetes care and structural heart, while enhancing its portfolio with the introduction of line extensions of its science-based products. Abbott's strategic response to the pandemic illustrates its ability to foresee and confront unexpected situations, leveraging its organizational capabilities and knowledge management to navigate complex challenges. The company has also implemented restructuring plans to streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve efficiencies across various business segments. As part of its future planning, Abbott continues to monitor credit worthiness and establish allowances for doubtful accounts, ensuring resilience in its financial management. Overall, Abbott's actions during the pandemic reflect a multifaceted approach to maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions, thereby enhancing its organizational resilience and ability to thrive in turbulent markets.

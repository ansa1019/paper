During 2020, we continued to build on our technical, operational and financial foundation to drive our long-term growth strategy. Despite the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced limited financial disruption and maintained normal business operations subject to local government health measures. We consistently executed our product roadmap and launched multiple products in leading-edge manufacturing technologies, demonstrating our operational flexibility and adaptability in response to changing market conditions. We monitored demand signals and adjusted our supply chain requirements based on changing customer needs and demands, reflecting our ability to reconfigure operations in unexpected situations. Our strategy to establish AMD as the industry's high-performance computing leader included entering into a definitive agreement to acquire Xilinx, Inc., which is expected to enhance our capabilities and resilience in the face of competitive pressures. We recognized a significant income tax benefit due to the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, which was supported by our history of profitable operating results and favorable forecasts of future profitability. Our financial condition improved, with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments increasing significantly, providing a solid foundation for future resource deployment. We maintained a valuation allowance for certain tax attributes, reflecting our proactive measures in risk assessment and management. Our ability to sustain and grow profitability is supported by the continued positive momentum of our consumer and commercial products, which have been well received in the market. We continue to assess our product schedules and roadmaps to make necessary adjustments, ensuring operational continuity and alignment with market demands. The increase in our operating income was primarily driven by higher sales, which more than offset increased operating expenses, demonstrating our organizational effectiveness and resilience in navigating financial challenges. Our international sales represented a significant portion of total sales, indicating our capacity to operate effectively in a global business environment. We believe our cash reserves and access to capital markets will be sufficient to fund operations and support strategic initiatives over the next 12 months. Overall, our performance during 2020 illustrates our organizational resilience, characterized by our ability to absorb strain and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, while continuing to innovate and respond to external pressures.

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted our operations, leading to a substantial reduction in da Vinci procedures, particularly in regions like China, where procedures per week declined by approximately 90% at the peak. As the pandemic subsided, we observed a recovery in procedure volume, reaching about 70% of pre-COVID levels by the end of the first quarter of 2020 in China. However, as the pandemic spread to Western Europe and the U.S., we experienced a significant decline in da Vinci procedures, with volumes dropping to approximately 30% of pre-pandemic levels in April 2020. The resurgence of COVID-19 cases led to further declines in elective procedures, demonstrating the need for operational flexibility and adaptability in response to external pressures. Our response to the pandemic included prioritizing health and safety, supporting customers with financial relief programs, and ensuring continuity of supply by collaborating with suppliers and distributors. The customer relief program, initiated in April 2020, aimed to mitigate the impact of underutilization by providing service fee credits, deferring lease payments, and extending payment terms. The pandemic has also underscored the importance of maintaining organizational health and resilience, as we navigated disruptions in healthcare operations and patient flow. We anticipate that system placements will lag behind the recovery of da Vinci procedure volume, as hospitals focus on filling unused capacity before making new purchases. The depth of the pandemic's impact on individual markets varies based on local conditions, including the availability of testing capabilities and government interventions. We expect that the ongoing uncertainty will continue to affect hospital spending and procedure volumes in the near term. Our strategic initiatives are focused on ensuring operational continuity and supporting customers through this challenging environment, while also investing in development programs to enhance our offerings. The resilience strategies we have implemented are designed to enable us to adjust to unexpected situations and maintain performance under pressure. We recognize the need for effective risk management and resource allocation to navigate the complexities of the current business environment. The pandemic has highlighted the importance of collaboration networks and inter-organizational collaboration in ensuring recovery and future growth. As we move forward, we will continue to assess the implications of external disturbances on our operations and adapt our strategies accordingly to sustain organizational resilience and effectiveness.

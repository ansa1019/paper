Nee and its subsidiaries require funds to support and grow their businesses, which are primarily provided by cash flows from operations, borrowings, or issuances of short- and long-term debt. The ability to maintain a strong investment-grade credit rating is essential for accessing liquidity and capital markets, which are significant sources of support for operational continuity and resilience against external pressures. Nee and FPL are closely monitoring the global outbreak of COVID-19 and are taking steps intended to mitigate the potential risks posed by the pandemic, demonstrating a proactive approach to crisis management and preparedness. FPL's service area was impacted by hurricanes, and it determined not to seek recovery of storm restoration costs through customer surcharges, instead recording these costs as storm restoration expenses, reflecting an adaptive strategy to manage operational impacts under extreme conditions. The use of available reserve amortization to offset storm restoration costs indicates a strategic response to maintain organizational health and operational flexibility during adverse events. Nee's management believes that adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of its fundamental earnings power, which is critical for performance maintenance under challenging conditions. The companyâ€™s investments in renewable energy and infrastructure are aimed at enhancing its operational capabilities and resilience, as evidenced by the addition of new wind and solar generating capacity, which contributes to long-term sustainability and competitive advantage. The strategic initiatives undertaken by Nee, including the acquisition of assets and the development of renewable projects, reflect a commitment to organizational transformation and adaptability in response to market volatility and environmental disruptions. The management's approach to risk assessment and resource allocation is integral to navigating complex situations and ensuring organizational effectiveness. The reliance on inter-organizational collaboration and strategic tools for resource generation further supports the company's resilience strategies. The ability to foresee and confront challenges, such as economic downturns or regulatory changes, is essential for maintaining performance under pressure and achieving major objectives. The company's financial strategies, including the management of interest rate exposure and credit risk, are designed to enhance its resilience against market fluctuations and ensure operational continuity. The emphasis on knowledge management and the development of human capital are vital for fostering a learning organization capable of thriving in turbulent markets. Overall, Nee's multifaceted approach to organizational resilience encompasses strategic foresight, operational management, and the cultivation of social capital, enabling it to adapt and flourish amidst adversity.

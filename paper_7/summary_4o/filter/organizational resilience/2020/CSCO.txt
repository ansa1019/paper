During fiscal 2020, we delivered growth in margins and earnings per share in a very challenging environment with the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating our ability to maintain operational continuity and adapt to unexpected situations. The pandemic has driven organizations globally to digitize their operations and support remote workforces at a faster speed and greater scale than ever before. Our actions included a seamless transition to work from home, leveraging a long-standing flexible work policy, which allowed us to maintain productivity and support systems for our employees, customers, and partners. We introduced a Cisco Capital Business Resiliency Program, leveraging available funds to provide organizations with access to financing solutions that support business continuity and resource generation. This program aims to help customers and partners access the technology they need now, invest for recovery, and defer payments, thereby enhancing their operational flexibility and resilience. We remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, which is critical as our customers navigate change at an unprecedented pace. Our strategic priorities include transforming infrastructure, expanding applications and analytics, and addressing security needs, which collectively contribute to our organizational resilience. The overall environment remains uncertain, yet we continue to invest aggressively in priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term, reflecting our commitment to adaptability and strategic resilience. We experienced broad-based weakening in the global macroeconomic environment, impacting our commercial and enterprise markets, yet we believe that our strategic initiatives and investments will enable us to confront these challenges effectively. The restructuring plan initiated during fiscal 2020 aims to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas, which is expected to generate cost savings and enhance our organizational capabilities. Our liquidity and capital resources remain strong, allowing us to utilize cash resources for strategic investments, customer financing activities, and operational management. We believe our strong cash and cash equivalents position is critical during this time of uncertainty and will support our resilience strategies. The increase in deferred revenue and remaining performance obligations indicates our ability to adapt to customer needs and maintain service innovation. We continue to assess the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial condition, ensuring that we are prepared to respond to environmental disruptions and maintain our performance under pressure. Our commitment to stakeholder engagement and collaboration networks further enhances our organizational strength and capacity to recover from adversity. The multifaceted nature of our resilience strategies reflects our focus on sustaining operational effectiveness and fostering an environment conducive to growth and flourishing amidst turbulent markets.

The global economy continued to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, many countries and regions, including the United States, showed signs of slowing economic activity, potentially indicating the early stages of a recession. Economic activity began to be adversely impacted by the effects of monetary and fiscal policy tightening as years of fiscal stimulus from governments and accommodative monetary policy from global central banks began to wane. Despite various economic headwinds, several key economic indicators in the U.S., including employment, have demonstrated resilience. The growth in economic activity and demand for goods and services, alongside supply chain complications, contributed to significant inflationary pressures. Various supply bottlenecks contributed to inflationary pressure throughout much of 2022. The Russia-Ukraine conflict, including the sanctions imposed in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, have exacerbated and may further exacerbate these issues and trends globally, contributing to substantial market volatility and increased pressures on labor supply. The actions taken by Russia in Ukraine starting in February 2022 have caused volatility in the commodities markets. Higher interest rates in conjunction with slower growth or weaker currencies in some emerging market economies have caused, and may further cause, the default risk of these countries to increase, impacting the operations or value of investments that operate in these regions. Labor disputes, shortages of material and skilled labor, work stoppages, and increasing labor costs can adversely impact operations. The ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity is critical for maintaining organizational resilience. The companyâ€™s ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations is essential. The overall liquidity framework and cash management approach are based on seeking to build an investment portfolio that is cash flow matched, providing cash inflows from insurance assets that meet expected cash outflows to pay liabilities. The management of liquidity and capital requirements focuses on cash flows before the consolidation of funds and seeks to maintain access to sufficient liquidity through various sources. The company's primary sources of liquidity consist of amounts received from operating activities, realizations on carried interest from investment funds, and cash inflows in respect of new premiums and policyholder deposits. The overall business environment is influenced by economic conditions, which can have a substantial impact on financial performance and operational results. The ability to adapt and respond to unexpected situations and external pressures is vital for organizational health and effectiveness. The management's discussion emphasizes the importance of strategic initiatives, resource allocation, and operational flexibility in navigating complex situations and ensuring organizational survival in turbulent markets.

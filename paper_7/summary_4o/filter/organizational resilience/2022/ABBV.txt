AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people, and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases, reflecting its commitment to organizational resilience. The company’s strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, maximizing the benefits of the Allergan acquisition, and ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. Following the closing of the Allergan acquisition in 2020, AbbVie implemented an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization, which resulted in $2.5 billion of annual cost synergies in 2022. In response to the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, AbbVie announced the suspension of operations for all aesthetics products in Russia while ensuring that essential pharmaceutical products continue to be sold to help ensure patients receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines, demonstrating adaptability under challenging conditions. The company continues to closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources around the world in response to COVID-19 to ensure that patients receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines, which reflects its operational flexibility and crisis management capabilities. AbbVie’s mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines and products that solve serious health issues today and address the medical challenges of tomorrow while achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution. The company intends to execute its strategy by maximizing the benefits of a diversified revenue base with multiple long-term growth drivers and leveraging its commercial strength and international infrastructure across therapeutic areas. AbbVie continues to invest in and expand its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, and eye care, as well as investment in key on-market products, which is indicative of its commitment to resource generation and future planning. The company’s financial performance in 2022 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $58.1 billion, reflecting growth across its immunology, neuroscience, and aesthetics portfolios, which underscores its ability to maintain performance under pressure. AbbVie expects to achieve its strategic objectives through revenue growth driven by increasing market share and indication expansion, effectively managing the impact of Humira biosimilar erosion, and continuing investment in the global expansion of aesthetics. The company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt, or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by material declines in demand for its products or other unfavorable changes in business conditions, highlighting the importance of strategic resilience. AbbVie’s long-term success depends on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, reflecting its commitment to organizational learning and knowledge management. The company regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances and establishes an allowance for credit losses equal to the estimate of future losses, demonstrating its proactive measures in risk management and credit risk mitigation.

2022 was a transformative year for AMD as we took several major steps that scaled and reshaped our business. We completed our strategic acquisition of Xilinx, Inc., which expanded our technology and product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware acceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies. This acquisition established AMD in multiple embedded markets where we have traditionally not had a significant presence, thereby enhancing our organizational capabilities and resilience. We also expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc., positioning us to provide the industry's broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators, which help enable best performance, security, flexibility, and total cost of ownership for leading-edge data centers. Our financial results reflect the strength of our diversified business model despite challenging market conditions. The increase in net revenue was driven by significant growth in our data center segment, primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC server processors, indicating our adaptability to changing market demands. Although we experienced a decrease in client segment revenue due to lower processor shipments driven by a weak PC market, our operational flexibility allowed us to navigate these challenges effectively. We continued executing our product technology roadmap by delivering new leadership products and technologies, which are designed to address the demand for compute-accelerated data center workloads and reduce the time to insights and discoveries. Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced limited disruptions during 2022 and continued to monitor our operations and public health measures implemented by governmental authorities. Our strategic initiatives, including the establishment of a new commercial paper program and a revolving credit agreement, reflect our commitment to maintaining financial resilience and operational continuity. The increase in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments was primarily driven by the cash acquired from the Xilinx acquisition and cash flows from operations, which further strengthens our financial position. We believe our cash resources, along with our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, will be sufficient to fund operations over the next 12 months and beyond, demonstrating our proactive measures in resource management and risk mitigation. Our ability to foresee and confront challenges, such as the significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain, underscores our organizational resilience and commitment to maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The strategic investments across all segments, including an increase in headcount through acquisitions and organic growth, further enhance our operational capabilities and support our long-term objectives. Overall, our performance under pressure and strategic response to environmental disruptions illustrate our organizational strength and commitment to thriving in a complex and dynamic business environment.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the various responses to it created significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption. We cannot predict the future impacts of this ongoing and any new pandemic(s). The increase in operating margin is primarily due to revenues growing at a slower rate as compared to the increase in content amortization, which was impacted by delays in content releases due to the pandemic. Revenue growth during the year was impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, highlighting the need for adaptability in our business operations. We expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change, indicating a strategic response to external pressures. Our ability to obtain financing will depend on our development efforts, business plans, operating performance, and the condition of the capital markets, which reflects our organizational resilience in navigating financial uncertainties. We anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds, and access to financing sources will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months and beyond, demonstrating our operational flexibility and resource management capabilities. The contractual obligations related to content acquisition, licensing, and production reflect our strategic initiatives to maintain a competitive advantage and ensure business continuity. We have built our own global content delivery network to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members, which enhances our organizational capabilities and resilience strategies. The increase in technology and development expenses was primarily due to a rise in personnel-related costs, underscoring the importance of human capital in our organizational transformation efforts. Our business model is subscription-based, which requires us to continuously assess customer needs and adapt our service offerings accordingly. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, reflecting the complexity and dynamic capabilities of our operations. Our investments in original content require more cash upfront, indicating a strategic allocation of resources to enhance our future performance and resilience. We believe that it is more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets will ultimately be realized, which reflects our organizational foresight and planning. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was driven by a significant increase in revenues, coupled with a decrease in cash payments for content assets, demonstrating our ability to maintain performance under pressure. The anticipated timing of payments related to our content obligations indicates a proactive approach to managing our financial commitments and ensuring operational continuity. Overall, our organizational practices and strategic tools are designed to enhance our resilience in the face of environmental disruptions and to support our long-term growth objectives.

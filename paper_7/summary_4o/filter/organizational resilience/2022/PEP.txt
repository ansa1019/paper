PepsiCo faced many challenges in 2022, including supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, shifting consumer preferences, and the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. To address these challenges, the company is driven by a strategic transformation approach called pep+ (PepsiCo Positive), which emphasizes sustainability and human capital. This approach aims to create growth and value by operating within planetary boundaries and inspiring positive change. The company is focused on building a circular and inclusive value chain, achieving net-zero emissions by 2040, and becoming net water positive by 2030. PepsiCo continues to monitor existing and proposed laws and regulations that may impact its operations, considering actions to mitigate any unfavorable impacts. The company’s risk management framework is designed to identify, assess, prioritize, and address various risks, including those related to cybersecurity, food safety, sustainability, and supply chain inflation. The board of directors oversees the integrated risk management framework, which includes regular updates on key risks and the impact of disruptive events such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and COVID-19. PepsiCo's operations are impacted by international risks, including unstable economic and political conditions, which necessitate a proactive approach to risk management. The company has implemented measures to manage commodity price fluctuations and foreign exchange risks, utilizing fixed-price contracts and derivative instruments. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has introduced additional risks, including supply chain disruptions and increased operational costs, which the company continues to monitor closely. PepsiCo’s operations in Russia and Ukraine accounted for a small percentage of consolidated net revenue, but the conflict has created significant geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. The company is committed to adapting its strategies to navigate these challenges effectively, ensuring operational continuity and resilience in the face of adversity. The board and management evaluate risks considering short-, medium-, and long-term impacts on the business, fostering a corporate culture of integrity and risk awareness. The company’s strategic initiatives are aimed at enhancing organizational flexibility and responsiveness to external pressures, ensuring that it can maintain performance and adapt to changing market conditions.

In 2018, we continued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities, which included helping marketers use our products to connect with consumers and making our ads more relevant and effective. We anticipate that additional investments in expanding our data center capacity, network infrastructure, and office facilities will support our growth and enhance our operational flexibility. We are committed to investing in safety and security, marketing, video content, and long-term technology initiatives, which we believe will further our mission to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. The increase in advertising revenue was driven by an increase in the number of ads delivered and the average price per ad, influenced by user engagement and demand for our ad inventory. Trends in user metrics, including daily active users and monthly active users, affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show and the value of our ads to marketers. We expect that user growth will continue to be concentrated in regions with relatively lower average revenue per user, which may impact our overall revenue growth trajectory. Our operational management strategy includes a focus on research and development, with significant increases in payroll and benefits expenses due to headcount growth in engineering and technical functions. We also anticipate continued hiring in marketing and sales to support our strategic initiatives. The complexities of our business environment necessitate a proactive approach to risk management, including the evaluation of legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory inquiries that could impact our financial condition. Our ability to adapt and respond to external pressures is critical for maintaining organizational health and effectiveness. We recognize the importance of strategic resilience and the need for ongoing assessment of our operational resources and capabilities to ensure continued performance under pressure. The integration of intellectual property from acquisitions involves intercompany transactions that may affect our provision for income taxes, highlighting the interconnectedness of our strategic planning and financial management. We are committed to maintaining a trajectory of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, emphasizing the importance of resilience strategies and mechanisms to navigate environmental disruptions and uncertainties. Our organizational practices are designed to enhance our adaptability and responsiveness to market volatility and evolving customer needs, ensuring that we remain competitive in a turbulent business landscape. The anticipated growth in capital expenditures reflects our commitment to investing in the infrastructure necessary to support our long-term objectives and operational continuity. We believe that our strategic foresight and resource allocation will enable us to confront future challenges effectively, thereby enhancing our organizational resilience and capacity for transformation.

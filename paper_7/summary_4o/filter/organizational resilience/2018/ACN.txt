The provided text primarily discusses net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and does not contain explicit references to organizational resilience or related concepts. However, the context of financial performance and the structure of equity interests may imply an underlying framework for organizational health and stability, which are essential for resilience. The mention of income attributable to shareholders and the involvement of leadership in equity interests could suggest a focus on maintaining stakeholder engagement and financial performance, which are critical components of a resilient organization. While the text does not directly address themes such as adaptability, resource allocation, or strategic initiatives that are typically associated with organizational resilience, the financial metrics and structures referenced may reflect the organization's capacity to navigate challenges and sustain operations, albeit indirectly.

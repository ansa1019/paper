The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. We have extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI, which reflects our adaptability to changing market demands. Our revenue for fiscal year 2019 increased 21% year over year, reflecting growth in each of our market platforms, including gaming, professional visualization, datacenter, and automotive. We experienced significant volatility in our gaming revenue during fiscal year 2019, which we believe was influenced by external pressures such as deteriorating macroeconomic conditions in China, impacting consumer demand. We believe that customers across broad-based vertical markets and geographies became increasingly cautious due to economic uncertainty, which affected our visibility and expectations for recovery in the datacenter market. Our operational flexibility is demonstrated by our ability to adjust our product shipments in response to fluctuations in end-user demand, allowing us to manage inventory effectively. Our commitment to research and development, which increased by 32% in fiscal year 2019, reflects our strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing our organizational capabilities and maintaining competitive advantage. The gross margin for fiscal year 2019 was 61.2%, which reflects our continued shift toward higher-value platforms, demonstrating resilience in our operational performance despite challenges. We have also implemented measures to mitigate risks associated with inventory management, including adjusting our inventory provisions based on future demand forecasts and market conditions. Our liquidity position, with $7.42 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, provides us with the financial resources necessary to navigate potential adversities. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net income, which underscores our operational effectiveness and resilience strategies. We recognize that our ability to foresee and confront sudden disruptive changes is crucial for our survival and growth. Our strategic response to environmental disruptions includes ongoing investments in innovation and technology, which are essential for maintaining our organizational health and performance. We believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, which is indicative of our preparedness for future challenges. Our management's discussion and analysis reflect our commitment to maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions, which is central to our organizational resilience.

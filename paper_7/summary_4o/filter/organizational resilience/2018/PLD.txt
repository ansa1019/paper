During the year ended December 31, 2018, operating fundamentals remained strong for our O&M portfolio, with occupancy at 97.5%. We completed significant activities, including the DCT transaction for $8.5 billion, which involved the issuance of $6.6 billion of equity and the assumption of $1.9 billion of debt. We repaid $1.8 billion of the assumed debt using proceeds from debt issuances. Our O&M disposition program of non-strategic assets generated approximately $14 billion in proceeds, allowing us to focus on high-quality properties in the best markets. We ended 2018 with vacancies at historic lows, strong customer and investor demand, and record-long lease terms. However, we remain cautious due to current market volatility caused by trade disputes and uncertainty regarding the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. We evaluate our business operations based on the NOI of our two operating segments: real estate operations and strategic capital, which are impacted by development, acquisition, and disposition activities. The operating fundamentals in our markets continue to be strong, increasing rents and maintaining high occupancies. Our strategic capital segment includes revenues from asset and property management and other fees, which fluctuate due to changes in the number of real estate assets and transactional activity. We monitor our operating performance using a "same store" analysis to evaluate ongoing business operations, which allows us to assess the impact of external pressures on our financial performance. Our ability to generate cash from operating activities and distributions from co-investment ventures is adequate to meet anticipated future development and operational needs. We expect to fund our cash needs principally from fees earned for services performed, proceeds from property dispositions, and borrowing capacity under credit facilities. We maintain sufficient liquidity and work with co-investment ventures to refinance maturing debt, which is critical for sustaining operational continuity and addressing potential risks. Our overall debt increased by $1.7 billion primarily due to the DCT acquisition, and we have taken measures to reduce our effective interest rate and lengthen the maturities of our debt. We recognize the importance of maintaining a strong balance sheet and operational flexibility to navigate environmental disruptions and market volatility. Our strategic initiatives focus on enhancing organizational capabilities and resilience, ensuring we can adapt to complex situations and maintain performance under pressure. The management of our business and review of operating fundamentals on an O&M basis allows us to understand the entire impact on our financial statements, which is essential for effective decision-making and resource allocation. We are committed to proactive measures in crisis management and organizational transformation to foster resilience and support long-term growth.

Our goal is to achieve sales growth at the high-end of the medical technology (medtech) industry and maintain our capital allocation strategy that prioritizes acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases. We reported net earnings and continued our capital allocation strategy by investing in acquisitions, which reflects our adaptability and strategic response to market conditions. The transfer of certain intellectual properties between tax jurisdictions resulted in a significant non-cash tax benefit, demonstrating our ability to reconfigure resources effectively. Our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates. We supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund our activities as necessary, indicating operational flexibility in resource allocation. We maintain debt levels that we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment, and financing plans, which reflects our strategic management and resilience in the face of economic pressures. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to increased payments for acquisitions, indicating our proactive measures to enhance organizational capabilities and market position. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs from a variety of sources, including cash from operations, commercial paper, and existing credit lines, which underscores our organizational health and preparedness for unexpected situations. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangibles are primarily based on factors including competitive environment and market share, which reflects our organizational foresight and strategic planning. We are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions, and claims arising in the normal course of business, which could impact our operational continuity and necessitate effective crisis management strategies. The ultimate cost to resolve these matters may be materially different than the current estimates and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, highlighting the need for robust risk management practices. We believe that the ultimate outcomes of our tax positions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, reflecting our confidence in navigating complex regulatory environments. Our assessment as to the useful lives of intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment and macroeconomic conditions, which illustrates our commitment to maintaining organizational coherence and effectiveness. We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill, as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values exceeded their respective recorded values, demonstrating our organizational strength and resilience. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance, which aligns with our focus on sustaining growth and adaptability in a turbulent market.

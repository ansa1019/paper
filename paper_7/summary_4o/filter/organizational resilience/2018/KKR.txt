As a global investment firm, we are affected by financial and economic conditions globally, which have a substantial impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Global and regional economic conditions impact the values of the investments we make, our ability to exit these investments profitably, and our ability to raise capital from investors. The economic environment can present substantial risks but also opportunities to invest at reduced valuations that position us for future growth and investment returns. Our ability to attract new capital and investors is driven by their perception of the alternative asset management industry and our investment products as attractive vehicles for capital appreciation or income. We have expanded into strategies such as energy, infrastructure, real estate, and growth equity, which may enhance our organizational resilience by diversifying our investment portfolio and adapting to changing market conditions. Our ability to maintain and grow our revenue base is dependent upon successfully deploying capital and participating in capital markets transactions, which may be impacted by greater competition and high valuations. Challenging market and economic conditions may adversely affect our ability to exit and realize value from our investments, resulting in lower-than-expected returns. The strength and liquidity of the U.S. and relevant global equity markets affect the valuation of our investments and our ability to successfully exit our equity positions. We may experience periods of reduced investment activity, which tends to result in reduced potential future investment gains, lower transaction fees, and lower fees for our capital markets business line. Our segment revenues consist of fees, performance income, and investment income, and our ability to grow revenues depends in part on attracting new capital and investors. Our investments are influenced by various economic conditions that are difficult to quantify or predict, which may have a significant impact on their valuation and, therefore, on the investment income we realize. We manage our liquidity and capital requirements by focusing on our cash flows and anticipate that our primary liquidity needs will consist of cash required to grow our business lines, fund capital commitments, and service debt obligations. We have access to funding under various credit facilities and other borrowing arrangements, which may enhance our operational flexibility in times of economic strain. The performance of our investments is significantly impacted by the global financial markets, and fluctuations in net gains from investment activities are driven primarily by changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio. Our ability to adapt to environmental disruptions and maintain operational continuity is critical for our organizational health and success. We continuously assess our strategic initiatives and risk management practices to ensure resilience against external pressures and market volatility. Our organizational capabilities, including knowledge management and strategic foresight, are essential for navigating complex situations and ensuring long-term sustainability.

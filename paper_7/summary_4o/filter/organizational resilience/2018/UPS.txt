During 2018, we produced strong revenue growth across all three segments, realizing improvements in revenue per piece as pricing and growth initiatives drove an increase in yields in all major products. We achieved solid operating profit growth in both our international package and supply chain & freight segments, although operating profit in our U.S. domestic segment was negatively impacted by planned costs related to our transformation strategy, higher pension expenses, and the impact of bringing new facility and technology projects on-line. The benefits of our efficiency and growth initiatives in the U.S. will not be fully realized until future periods. We believe that these adjusted financial measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and analysts in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance, reflecting our organizational capabilities and operational flexibility. Our allocation methodologies are refined periodically to reflect changes in our businesses, which is essential for maintaining organizational health and resilience. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher volume, increased employee compensation costs, and higher fuel prices, indicating our adaptability to environmental perturbations. The growth in pickup and delivery and network costs was impacted by several factors, including higher employee compensation and benefit costs largely resulting from volume growth, which reflects our resource allocation strategies and operational management. We incurred higher costs associated with outside contract carriers due to volume growth, higher fuel surcharges, and general rate increases, demonstrating our ability to confront external pressures. The increase in total cost per piece was primarily impacted by the cost increases described previously, which underscores our need for strategic adaptation in response to market conditions. Our overall average daily volume increased largely due to strong demand from several sectors, indicating our capability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity. The increase in revenue per piece was positively impacted by base rate increases and higher fuel surcharge rates, which reflects our strategic response to fluctuating market conditions. We recognized pre-tax mark-to-market losses related to our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans, which may affect our financial resources and require proactive measures in our financial planning. Our investments in technology and infrastructure are part of a multi-year transformation strategy aimed at enhancing our operational continuity and resilience. We continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize our capital structure, which is essential for sustaining our competitive advantage in turbulent markets. Our commitment to maintaining a strong cash position and access to capital markets is critical for supporting our strategic initiatives and ensuring long-term organizational success. The changes in our expense allocation methodologies and the impact of transformation strategy costs on our financial performance highlight the multifaceted nature of our organizational dynamics and the importance of effective resource management. Overall, our performance under pressure and ability to adapt to complex situations are key indicators of our organizational resilience and capacity for future growth.

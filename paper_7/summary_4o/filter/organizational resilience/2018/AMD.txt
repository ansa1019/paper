We are a global semiconductor company primarily offering x86 microprocessors, chipsets, discrete and integrated graphics processing units, and server and embedded processors. Our 2018 financial results demonstrate the success of our strong product roadmap execution, with customers continuing to adopt our high-performance products, which accounted for over 65% of our annual revenue. We significantly expanded our desktop processor offerings in 2018 with the launch of new products that enhance our competitive advantage and operational flexibility. Our operating income improved significantly, driven by higher demand for our products, which reflects our ability to adapt and respond to market needs effectively. The increase in revenue and gross margin was primarily due to the ramp of new products with higher gross margins than the corporate average, indicating our strategic response to external pressures and market dynamics. Our operating results tend to vary seasonally, and we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to revenue recognition and inventory valuation, which are critical for maintaining organizational health and performance under pressure. We believe our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balance, along with our secured revolving line of credit, will be sufficient to fund operations over the next 12 months, demonstrating our preparedness and resilience in managing financial resources. We are committed to ongoing research and development, which increased significantly in 2018, reflecting our focus on innovation and adaptation strategies to enhance our product offerings and market position. The increase in operating expenses was driven by higher product engineering and design-related costs, which are essential for maintaining our competitive edge and ensuring operational continuity. We have established provisions for rights of return and price protection on unsold products, which are critical for managing risks associated with inventory and sales. Our international sales as a percentage of net revenue were substantial, indicating our ability to navigate and respond to global market conditions and demands. We have entered into various operating leases and contractual obligations that reflect our strategic planning and resource management, ensuring we can adapt to future operational needs. Our financial condition and liquidity position are bolstered by our ability to access capital markets, which is crucial for sustaining growth and resilience in a turbulent business environment. We continuously assess the likelihood of recovering deferred tax assets and manage uncertainties in tax liabilities, which are integral to our financial resilience. Overall, our organizational practices, including risk assessment and resource allocation, are designed to support our long-term objectives and enhance our adaptability in the face of environmental disruptions and competitive challenges.

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted our operations, resulting in a substantial reduction in da Vinci procedures, particularly in early 2020, with a decline of approximately 90% in China. As the pandemic subsided, we observed a recovery in procedure volume, yet fluctuations continued due to resurgences of COVID-19, affecting our ability to maintain operational continuity and respond effectively to external pressures. Our response to these challenges has included prioritizing the health and safety of all stakeholders, supporting customers according to their operational and economic priorities, and ensuring continuity of supply by collaborating with suppliers. We have also focused on securing our workforce economically, recognizing that our team will be critical in navigating the recovery phase post-pandemic. The pandemic has highlighted the importance of adaptability and resilience in our business model, as we continue to invest in development programs while managing resource constraints. 

Our business model emphasizes decreasing variability in surgical outcomes through dependable, consistent functionality and an integrated user experience, which is essential for maintaining organizational health. We have implemented a customer relief program to support clients during periods of underutilization, reflecting our commitment to inter-organizational collaboration and resource generation. The ongoing challenges posed by staffing shortages and supply chain issues have underscored the need for operational flexibility and strategic adaptation to ensure we meet customer needs effectively.

We have experienced strong demand for our systems as utilization levels recovered, indicating a positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The installed base of da Vinci surgical systems has grown, and we utilize this metric to assess future performance and operational effectiveness. Our strategic initiatives include expanding our product offerings and enhancing our training technologies to optimize efficiency and support our customers in navigating complex situations. 

The resilience strategies we have adopted, including the introduction of extended use instruments and the development of new product lines, are designed to enhance our competitive advantage and address evolving market demands. We recognize that the ability to foresee and confront disruptive changes is critical for survival and growth, and we remain committed to fostering an organizational culture that embraces learning and innovation. Our focus on maintaining system integrity and performance amidst environmental disruptions is paramount as we continue to navigate the complexities of the current business landscape.

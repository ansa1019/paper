Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has necessitated substantial modifications to employee work locations and operations. While we have not experienced significant disruptions to our operations, the full impact of the pandemic on our future financial performance remains uncertain, including demand for our offerings and the actions that may be taken by governmental authorities. Our growth strategy depends upon our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, enter new markets, and drive broad adoption of our products and services. To remain competitive, we are investing significant resources in product development, marketing, and sales capabilities, which are essential for operational flexibility and adaptability in a dynamic business environment. The ongoing operation and availability of our platforms and systems are increasingly important as we help customers manage their financial lives, necessitating significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and privacy and security capabilities. We have implemented additional security measures and are working with state and federal governments to implement industry-wide security and anti-fraud measures. Our business is subject to significant seasonality, and we believe this seasonality will continue to impact our financial results. In August 2020, we reorganized certain technology and customer success functions to support our overall platform, which reflects our commitment to continuous improvement and resilience in the face of external pressures. The acquisition of Credit Karma has expanded our operational capabilities and is expected to enhance our competitive advantage. We are committed to maintaining our organizational health by managing costs effectively while investing in strategic initiatives that foster innovation and resilience. Our financial resources allow us to manage potential impacts from external disturbances, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect to continue generating significant cash from operations to meet our liquidity requirements. We believe that our strong liquidity profile enables us to respond quickly to opportunities, including the acquisition of technology or businesses, which is vital for sustaining growth and organizational success. Our operational management strategies include assessing risks and uncertainties associated with our business environment, which is critical for effective decision-making and strategic planning. The integration of acquired entities, such as Credit Karma, is managed to ensure alignment with our overall business objectives, thereby enhancing our organizational resilience. We continuously evaluate our operational resources and capabilities to ensure we can adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs, reinforcing our commitment to organizational effectiveness and performance maintenance.

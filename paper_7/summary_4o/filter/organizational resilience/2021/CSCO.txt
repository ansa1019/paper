In fiscal 2021, we delivered growth in revenue in a very challenging environment, as customers accelerated their digitization and cloud investments stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. We focused on executing and innovating to support and assist that transition, demonstrating our operational flexibility and adaptability to unexpected situations. Our strategy is to help our customers connect, secure, and automate in order to accelerate their digital agility in a cloud-first world, reflecting our commitment to resilience strategies that enable us to respond effectively to environmental disruptions. We have partnered with several of our key suppliers utilizing our volume purchasing and extending supply coverage to address supply chain challenges, which is critical for maintaining operational continuity and ensuring competitive advantage. The pandemic has driven organizations globally to digitize their operations and support remote workforces at an unprecedented scale, highlighting the importance of organizational health and the ability to absorb strain while preserving functioning. We remain focused on providing the technology and solutions our customers need to accelerate their digital organizations, which involves reconfiguring our trajectories toward the future and enhancing our resilience mechanisms. The actions taken include a seamless transition to work from home, ensuring the health and safety of employees who must be in the office, and providing technology and financial support for non-profits and first responders. Our ongoing consideration of supply chain management and inventory reflects our strategic response to external pressures and resource constraints, allowing us to optimize access to critical components. The restructuring plan initiated in fiscal 2021 aimed to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas, which is expected to generate significant cost savings and enhance our organizational capabilities. We continue to operate in a challenging macroeconomic and highly competitive environment, and while the overall environment remains uncertain, we are committed to driving profitable growth over the long term. Our focus on research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses reflects our strategic initiatives to maintain performance under pressure and ensure future planning aligns with customer needs. The increase in deferred revenue associated with our recurring software offerings indicates our ability to foresee and respond to market demands effectively. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents position is critical during this time of uncertainty, allowing us to use our resources for strategic investments and operational management. The COVID-19 pandemic has not materially impacted our liquidity and capital resources to date, but it has led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets, necessitating ongoing assessment of our organizational resilience and adaptability to future challenges.

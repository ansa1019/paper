In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented business continuity plans, including establishing a medical advisory group for employees and leveraging work-from-home infrastructure to facilitate social distancing. Our global crisis management team has focused on protecting our employees and customers, optimizing our operations, and securing our supply chain. We continue to monitor our return-to-office strategy based on science and data for the health and safety of our employees. The pandemic's impact on our operations and financial performance remains uncertain, particularly due to procedural delays and staffing shortages within healthcare facilities, which may continue to negatively affect demand for our products and overall performance. We have taken proactive measures to manage outstanding borrowings and increase available liquidity, including creating a cross-functional strategic cash management team to optimize funds to execute our core mission. Our efforts to adapt to the challenges posed by the pandemic have included significant cost reductions and a targeted lifting of spending controls implemented in response to the escalating situation. We remain committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses, which we believe will contribute to profitable sales growth. Our strategic initiatives are designed to ensure operational flexibility and resilience in the face of external pressures, including the challenging labor market and supply chain constraints. We have also focused on enhancing our organizational capabilities by investing in infrastructure to maximize opportunities in emerging markets, which we define as countries with strong growth potential based on their economic conditions and healthcare sectors. Our organizational health is further supported by our commitment to sustainability and corporate social responsibility, which underpin our business practices and stakeholder engagement. We are continuously assessing our operational resources and capabilities to ensure we can effectively respond to environmental disruptions and maintain performance under pressure. The multifaceted nature of our resilience strategies allows us to confront adversity and adapt to complex situations, ensuring that we can reconfigure our operations and resource allocation as necessary. Our approach to crisis management emphasizes the importance of collaboration networks and inter-organizational collaboration, which enhance our ability to recover from unexpected situations and maintain a focus on our major objectives. We believe that our long-term fundamentals remain strong, and we will manage through these challenges with strategic focus and the collective strength of our global team. As we navigate these turbulent markets, we are committed to fostering an organizational culture that promotes learning, adaptability, and innovation, ensuring our continued success and sustainability in the face of future challenges.

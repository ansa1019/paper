In fiscal 2015, we completed a major payment security project that provides enhanced encryption of payment card data at the point of sale in all of our U.S. and Canadian stores, which reflects our commitment to operational continuity and risk mitigation in response to the data breach. We have also rolled out EMV chip card technology in our U.S. stores, adding extra layers of payment card protection for customers. Our customer experience initiative is anchored on the principles of putting customers first and taking care of our associates, demonstrating our focus on organizational health and service innovation. We have taken a number of steps to enhance this initiative to provide our customers with a seamless and frictionless shopping experience, which is essential for maintaining performance under pressure. Our approach to driving productivity and efficiency is advanced through continuous operational improvement in the stores and our supply chain, which is indicative of our strategic response to external pressures. We initiated a multi-year program called Project Sync to optimize and efficiently operate our supply chain, aiming to reduce lead time from supplier to shelf and improve inventory turns, thereby enhancing our operational flexibility. The acquisition of Interline for $1.7 billion is intended to leverage its capabilities and expertise in MRO products to expand our share of the market, reflecting our strategic resilience and adaptability in a competitive landscape. We believe that our current cash position, access to long-term debt capital markets, and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases, and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years, which underscores our organizational resourcefulness and financial health. The expenses incurred related to the data breach, including costs to investigate and provide identity protection services, highlight our commitment to crisis management and recovery strategies. We recorded $198 million of pretax gross expenses related to the data breach in fiscal 2015, partially offset by expected insurance proceeds, which reflects our proactive measures in managing risks associated with such events. Our focus on interconnecting retail is based on building a competitive and seamless platform across all commerce channels, which is critical for enhancing customer engagement and operational effectiveness. We expect to reach 90% of our U.S. customers in two business days or less with parcel shipping through our distribution centers, demonstrating our commitment to operational continuity and responsiveness to customer needs. The increase in net sales for fiscal 2015 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales driven by increased customer transactions and average ticket growth, which is a testament to our organizational capabilities in adapting to market conditions. Overall, our strategic initiatives and operational improvements are designed to ensure that we maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, thereby enhancing our organizational resilience.

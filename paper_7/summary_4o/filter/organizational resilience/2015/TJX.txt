We are the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the U.S. and worldwide, operating over 3,600 stores through our four main segments. Fiscal 2016 was another successful year for TJX as we posted strong gains in net sales and solid earnings per share growth, while continuing to strengthen our infrastructure in support of our continuing growth. We implemented the first phase of an initiative to raise wages for our U.S. full- and part-time hourly store associates, reflecting our commitment to organizational health and employee engagement. The increase in same store sales was driven by an increase in customer traffic, indicating our ability to adapt to market demands. Our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2016 totaled $30.9 billion, a 6% increase over the previous year, reflecting our operational flexibility and resilience in a competitive landscape. The increase in same store sales was primarily due to an increase in customer traffic, demonstrating our capacity to respond effectively to external pressures. We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, which underscores our focus on maintaining performance under pressure. The fiscal 2016 increase in customer traffic and units sold, despite a reduction in the average ticket, reflects our strategic initiatives to enhance customer experience and operational management. Our segment profit margin for fiscal 2016 was 14.3%, compared to 14.6% in fiscal 2015, indicating our ongoing efforts to manage costs while navigating environmental perturbations. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher employee payroll costs associated with our wage initiative, which is a strategic response to enhance our organizational capabilities. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds, and credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year, reflecting our resilience strategies in financial resource management. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating results demonstrates the complexities of our international operations and the need for effective risk management. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on "segment profit or loss," which we define as pre-tax income or loss before general corporate expense, loss on early extinguishment of debt, and interest expense, emphasizing our focus on operational effectiveness. Our commitment to reinvest in our business by adding new stores and remodeling existing ones illustrates our proactive measures to ensure future planning and organizational evolution. The increase in same store sales for home fashions and apparel demonstrates our adaptability and responsiveness to customer needs, while the strategic planning for fiscal 2017 includes an increase in store openings, reflecting our organizational foresight. Our stock repurchase programs, which reduce our weighted average diluted shares outstanding, benefited our earnings per share growth, showcasing our resource generation capabilities. Overall, our performance in fiscal 2016 reflects our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite the presence of adversity, aligning with the principles of organizational resilience.

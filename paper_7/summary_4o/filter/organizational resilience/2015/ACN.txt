The provided text primarily discusses net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and does not contain explicit references to "IT capability" or related concepts. However, it is important to recognize that the management of financial performance, including net income, can indirectly relate to IT capabilities in the context of how organizations leverage technology to enhance operational efficiency, support financial activities, and optimize resource allocation. While the text does not directly address IT resources or capabilities, the underlying financial structures and organizational governance may imply a need for robust IT systems that support accurate financial reporting and decision-making processes. Thus, while no direct mention of IT capability is present, the financial management context suggests that effective IT resources and capabilities could play a crucial role in achieving organizational goals and enhancing performance outcomes.

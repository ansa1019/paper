Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities. Our operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis, with minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities. This operational flexibility allows for effective resource allocation and adaptation to changing market conditions. Our management views insurance businesses as possessing distinct operations, which include underwriting and investing, with underwriting decisions being the responsibility of unit managers. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, reflecting the need for effective risk management strategies. Our insurance businesses maintain extraordinary capital strength, which creates opportunities to negotiate and enter into contracts designed to meet the unique needs of buyers. The operational improvements in our railroad business, including improved service levels and lower fuel costs, demonstrate our ability to adapt and maintain performance under pressure. 

We continue to decline business when we believe prices are inadequate, yet we remain prepared to write substantially more business when appropriate prices can be attained relative to the risks assumed. Our utilities and energy businesses have benefited from the inclusion of newly-acquired businesses and higher earnings from several operations, showcasing our resilience strategies in response to external pressures. The operational management of our businesses reflects a commitment to maintaining organizational health and effectiveness, even in the face of environmental perturbations. 

In 2015, we recorded estimated losses in connection with a property loss event, highlighting the importance of preparedness and crisis management in our operations. Our management's discussion emphasizes the importance of maintaining significant liquidity and a strong capital base to support operational continuity and resilience in the face of adversity. We utilize various techniques to establish liabilities for unpaid losses, reflecting our commitment to effective resource management and risk assessment. The ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is evident in our approach to underwriting and investment activities, which are designed to mitigate risks and enhance organizational resilience.

Our strategy includes maintaining a diversified portfolio of investments and a focus on long-term performance, which supports our organizational capabilities and adaptability. The emphasis on collaboration networks and inter-organizational collaboration enhances our ability to respond to complex situations and market volatility. Our commitment to operational management and strategic adaptation ensures that we can confront challenges and leverage opportunities for growth. The dynamic capabilities of our businesses enable us to navigate uncertainties and maintain a trajectory of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

The organizationâ€™s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity is critical, particularly in the context of pharmaceutical research and development, where a high rate of failure is inherent. The process to bring a drug from discovery to regulatory approval can take over a decade and cost more than $1 billion, indicating the need for effective resource allocation and risk management strategies. We manage research and development spending across our portfolio of molecules, and a delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending. Our long-term success depends significantly on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on molecules currently in development. The acquisition of Novartis Animal Health has expanded our global commercial presence and increased our animal health product portfolio, which enhances our resilience against market fluctuations. We face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates, and while we manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques, significant fluctuations can impact our revenue and operating expenses. The pressures on national and regional healthcare budgets due to a growing aging population and ongoing economic challenges may lead to increased cost-containment measures, affecting our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions. The legislative debate surrounding pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement continues to drive risks that may affect our operational flexibility and strategic initiatives. Our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values, and we address these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. We recognize that various risks and uncertainties, including those related to health care legislation and economic conditions, may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations. We continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment and the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers. Our corporate risk-management policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of foreign currency exposures, which is essential for maintaining operational continuity. The nature of the pharmaceutical business is high-risk, requiring investments in a large number of projects to build a successful portfolio of approved products. We must make significant cost estimations and allocations, some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms. We believe that cash provided by operating activities and planned repatriations of foreign earnings will be sufficient to fund our domestic operating needs. The ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change is essential for survival and growth, and we must remain adaptable to maintain our competitive advantage in a turbulent market environment.

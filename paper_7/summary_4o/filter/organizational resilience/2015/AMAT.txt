Management believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in research, development and engineering (RD&E) to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers' most advanced designs. Applied's strategic priorities include developing products that help solve customers' challenges at technology inflections and expanding its served market opportunities in the semiconductor and display industries. The mobility trend remains the largest influence on industry spending, driving device manufacturers to continually improve their ability to deliver high-performance, low-power processors and affordable solid-state storage. Applied's results can vary significantly year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter due to cyclical industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips, display technologies, and other factors such as global economic conditions and technological advances. Applied's investments in new product growth focus on supporting the adoption of new technologies and addressing customer needs for future nodes. The company has maintained a commitment to investing in RD&E to continue to offer new products and technologies. Applied's backlog consists of orders for which written authorizations have been accepted and assigned shipment dates within the next 12 months, and approximately 70 percent of the backlog as of the end of fiscal 2015 is anticipated to be shipped within the first two quarters of fiscal 2016. The evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment requires significant judgment, and management believes that its consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Applied's ability to borrow under credit facilities is subject to bank approval, and the company has not utilized these facilities recently. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the amounts reported, and changes in estimates may occur as new events arise. Applied's management believes that cash generated from operations, together with existing cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to satisfy its liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. The company has also established a short-term commercial paper program and may issue commercial paper notes under this program in the future. Applied's marketing and selling expenses remained relatively flat due to continued cost management efforts, while general and administrative expenses decreased due to lower acquisition-related costs and continued cost management. The company has a history of responding to environmental disruptions and transforming itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations, reflecting its multifaceted approach to organizational resilience. Applied's operational flexibility and strategic initiatives are designed to address customer needs and adapt to changing market conditions, ensuring the maintenance of performance under pressure and the ability to recover from unexpected situations.

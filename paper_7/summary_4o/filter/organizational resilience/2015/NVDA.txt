Nvidia has transformed into a specialized platform company that targets four large markets where visual computing is essential and valued. Our vertical integration enables us to bring together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, systems, and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. The company is focused on delivering value through PC, mobile, and cloud architectures, which reflects our adaptability and operational flexibility in response to changing market conditions. During fiscal year 2016, we released many new products that deliver better performance and power efficiency, which helped double the number of users of our Geforce Experience PC gaming platform. Additionally, we launched Nvidia GameWorks VR, a software development kit that creates more immersive gameplay, demonstrating our commitment to service innovation and addressing customer needs. Our research and development expenses decreased due to the wind-down of Icera modem operations, allowing for continued investment in strategic growth areas, including deep learning and self-driving cars. This strategic response to operational challenges underlines our organizational resilience in confronting adverse conditions. 

We expect to incur additional restructuring charges related to the wind-down, which reflects our proactive measures in managing resource allocation and operational continuity. Our cash flow from operating activities increased, driven by changes in working capital and higher non-cash expenses, showcasing our ability to maintain performance under pressure. The overall gross margin was positively impacted by a richer product mix in our GPU business, which reflects our operational effectiveness and strategic initiatives to enhance profitability. 

Our investments are managed to ensure compliance with our investment policy, which requires the purchase of high-grade investment securities and diversification of asset types. As of January 31, 2016, we had $5.04 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, indicating strong financial resources that support our resilience strategies. The companyâ€™s ability to foresee and adapt to market volatility is evidenced by our partnerships in the automotive sector, where we utilize our Nvidia Drive PX platform for autonomous driving efforts. 

We recognize that external pressures, such as competitive pricing actions and changes in consumer demand, could impact our operations. However, our strategic foresight and organizational capabilities position us to navigate these challenges effectively. The wind-down of Icera operations allows for a reconfiguration of resources toward growth initiatives, reinforcing our organizational strength and commitment to innovation. Our liquidity and capital resources are managed to ensure we can meet operational needs, and we believe our existing cash balances will be sufficient for the next twelve months. We are also prepared for potential future challenges, as we continuously evaluate our strategic adaptation and resilience mechanisms to sustain growth and performance.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed several transactions that repositioned our portfolio and streamlined our co-investment ventures, which reflects our strategic resource allocation and operational flexibility. Our operating fundamentals remained strong, driven by high occupancy rates and positive rent growth, indicating our capability to respond to market dynamics effectively. The operating fundamentals in the markets in which we operate continue to be strong, which has driven rents higher and fueled development activity, demonstrating our ability to leverage technology resources and enhance firm performance. We evaluate our business operations based on the net operating income (NOI) of our two operating segments: real estate operations and strategic capital, which helps management understand the core operations of our real estate assets. The strategic capital segment includes revenues from asset and property management and other fees for services performed, as well as promotes earned from the unconsolidated co-investment ventures, indicating our management capability in optimizing revenue streams. We allocate the costs of our property management functions to the real estate operations segment through rental expenses and to the strategic capital segment through strategic capital expenses based on the square footage of the relative portfolios, which reflects our organizational integration and resource management practices. Our owned and managed operating portfolio does not include value-added properties or properties held for sale to third parties, allowing us to focus on our core operational capabilities. We believe reviewing these fundamentals allows management to understand the entire impact on the financial statements, which is essential for strategic decision-making. Our investments in real estate development and acquisitions are significant, with a total investment of $1.6 billion during 2017, which underscores our commitment to operational efficiency and market responsiveness. We also recognize the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other capabilities to enhance business strategies and work processes. The ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, and security is critical for our operational success. Our strategic capital revenues fluctuate due to the size of co-investment ventures under management and the transactional activity in the ventures, which highlights the impact of external influences on our financial performance. We expect to continue to develop and contribute properties to these ventures, depending on market conditions and other factors, indicating our agility in navigating the business environment. Our overall debt decreased by $1.2 billion from December 31, 2016, to December 31, 2017, primarily from the contribution of real estate properties, which reflects our strategic resource allocation and financial management practices. The ability to generate cash from operating activities, distributions from our co-investment ventures, and available financing sources is deemed adequate to meet our anticipated future development, acquisition, and operational requirements, demonstrating our organizational effectiveness and strategic alignment with business goals.

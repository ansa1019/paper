Servicenow is a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions that define, structure, manage, and automate services for global enterprises, helping customers improve service quality and reduce costs while scaling and automating their businesses. The company continues to invest in the development of its services, infrastructure, and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth. Our service management products include our platform, ITSM, ITBM, customer service management, HR service delivery, and security operations, which have similar features and functions and are generally priced on a per-user basis. Our ITOM products improve visibility, availability, and agility of enterprise services. We expect subscription revenues to grow in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to add new customers and upsell to existing customers. The average contract term for new customers was 32 months, reflecting our focus on customer relationships and the ability to tailor services in response to changing business needs. Our professional services revenues consist of fees associated with professional services, which include process design, implementation, configuration, and optimization of our products. We assess collectibility based on factors such as past collection history and customer creditworthiness, which are critical for effective information management. We recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term, which aligns with our operational efficiency and strategic resource allocation. The increase in subscription revenues was driven by upsells and an increase in customer count, indicating our capability to leverage technology resources effectively. Our gross profit percentage increased due to improved data center utilization and economies of scale, showcasing our operational flexibility and capability enhancement. We expect our cost of subscription revenues to increase in absolute dollar terms but at a slower rate than the increase in subscription revenues, leading to a slight increase in our subscription gross profit percentage. The company’s international operations have provided a significant portion of total revenues, representing 33% and 32% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Our research and development expenses increased as we continue to improve the existing functionality of our services and develop new applications to fill market needs, demonstrating our commitment to innovation and business transformation. The increase in headcount across departments reflects our strategic decisions to enhance organizational capabilities and support our growth. We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents balance and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including the expansion of data centers and investments in infrastructure capability. Our expectations for future revenues, cost of revenues, and operating expenses are based on the new revenue recognition standard and foreign exchange rates, which are critical for our financial activities and operational planning. The company’s ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities has become essential in transforming Servicenow into a competitive force in the market.

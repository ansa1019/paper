In 2017, we produced solid growth and operating results across all operating segments, with consolidated revenue increasing 8.2% to $65.872 billion, driven by shipment growth and benefits recognized from our network investments and portfolio initiatives. We believe that these adjusted financial measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and analysts in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Additionally, we supplement the reporting of our financial information with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted operating profit and operating margin, which are used internally by management for business unit operating performance analysis and resource allocation. Our overall volume increased across all products in 2017, largely due to continued growth in retail sales, particularly in e-commerce, which represents a larger percentage of total growth. Business-to-consumer shipments grew significantly, driving increases in both air and ground shipments. The growth in business-to-business shipments was slightly offset by declines in volume in professional services due to increased digitization and high-tech industries. We continue to deploy and utilize technology to increase package sorting and delivery productivity, which is critical for operational efficiency and enhancing our service capabilities. Our operating expenses for the period increased significantly, driven by volume growth and the costs associated with operating our domestic integrated air and ground network. We incurred higher employee compensation due to an increase in average daily union labor hours and growth in workforce size, which reflects our commitment to aligning human resources with operational demands. The increase in operating expenses was also influenced by higher costs associated with outside contract carriers and the implementation of new operational strategies, including expanded Saturday operations. We recognize the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to transform our firm into a competitive force. Our IT capabilities are essential in supporting business needs and enhancing our operational flexibility, which is vital in responding to market dynamics and consumer demands. The deployment of technology, such as our smart logistics network and capitalized software projects, is integral to our strategy for business innovation and transformation. We have made significant investments in technology infrastructure to support our operational processes and enhance our service offerings. The integration of digital technologies into our operations has enabled us to improve our performance metrics and achieve better market responsiveness. Our strategic resource allocation decisions are guided by the need to optimize our technology portfolio and enhance our organizational capabilities. We are focused on ensuring that our IT governance aligns with our business strategy and operational goals, enabling us to navigate regulatory contexts and capitalize on emerging opportunities in the marketplace. The ability to provide timely and reliable information to our users is central to our information management capability, which supports decision-making processes and enhances our overall business performance.

The company continues to believe that focused investments in research and development are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the company's core business strategy. The company designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices and personal computers, and sells a variety of related software, services, accessories, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications. The company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. The company’s capital expenditures are anticipated to include investments in data centers, corporate facilities, and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software, and enhancements. The company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis, aligning with the location of its customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. The company expects to continue to take product pricing actions in response to competitive pressures, which could adversely affect gross margins. The company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products will also impact its financial performance. The company’s investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses related to changes in fair value are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. The company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the company to record an impairment charge. The company accrues for estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled, which may adversely affect its results of operations. The company has entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk and foreign currency swaps to manage foreign currency risk. The company’s capital return program includes share repurchases and dividends, which are funded from current domestic cash, cash generated from ongoing U.S. operating activities, and borrowings. The company’s operational flexibility is supported by its ability to leverage technology resources and capabilities to enhance business strategies and work processes. The company’s strategic resource allocation decisions are influenced by market dynamics and competitive positioning, which are essential for maintaining its market-based performance and achieving operational efficiency. The company’s management believes that its IT capabilities, including the effective support of business needs and the mobilization of IT-based resources, are key to transforming the firm into a competitive force. The company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors, including industry-wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, and compressed product life cycles. The company’s organizational capabilities, including its management skills and technology management practices, are fundamental to its business process focus and overall firm performance.

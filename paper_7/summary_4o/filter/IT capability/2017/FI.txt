We are a leading global provider of financial services technology, offering account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, internet and mobile banking systems, and related services. Our operations are comprised of the payments and financial institution services segments, which provide essential services necessary for our clients to operate their businesses. The market for products and services offered by financial institutions continues to evolve rapidly, with traditional financial institutions and new market entrants regularly introducing and implementing new payment, deposit, lending, investment, and risk management products. This evolution has heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers, generate incremental revenue, comply with regulations, and enhance operating efficiency. We expect financial institutions to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information, maintain regulatory compliance, and offer innovative new services to their customers in this competitive environment. Our strategic initiatives include enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships and delivering innovation and integration that enables differentiated value for our clients. We anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions will continue to increase, creating revenue opportunities for us. The integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients, and we believe that our sizable and diverse client base provides a solid foundation for growth. We frequently review our portfolio to ensure we have the right set of businesses to execute our strategy, expecting to acquire businesses that meet client demand or change industry dynamics. Our acquisitions, such as those of online banking solutions and mortgage software providers, are intended to enhance our technology capabilities and better serve our clients. We recognize that the financial institutions marketplace has experienced significant changes, including a steady decline in the number of financial institutions due to mergers and acquisitions. These consolidations can impact our financial results, particularly through early contract termination fees. Our focus on long-term client relationships and recurring, transaction-oriented products and services has mitigated the impact of industry consolidation. We believe that our products and services can assist financial institutions in addressing regulatory and market challenges by providing new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce costs. Our commitment to operational effectiveness and disciplined capital allocation supports our ability to leverage IT capabilities to enhance business performance. The evolving regulatory conditions and cybersecurity scrutiny present challenges that we navigate through our strategic management practices and technology infrastructure. Our ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with other capabilities is vital for transforming our firm into a competitive force in the financial services technology sector.

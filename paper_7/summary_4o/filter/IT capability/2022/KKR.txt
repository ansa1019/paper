The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of KKR & Co. Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Our asset management and insurance businesses are materially affected by economic conditions and financial markets. Economic activity has been adversely impacted by monetary and fiscal policy tightening, which has led to significant inflationary pressures. The ability to raise capital from investors and make new investments is influenced by these economic conditions. Our investments are affected by market volatility, which can significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations. The performance of our investments is closely tied to market dynamics, including equity prices and credit spreads. The ability to deploy capital effectively is essential for maintaining operational flexibility and achieving competitive advantage. 

In our asset management segment, the management fees we earn are based on the performance of our investment strategies, which require effective coordination of our internal processes and resources. The management of our investment funds necessitates a focus on technology capabilities that enhance our operational efficiency and support our business needs. Our technology infrastructure plays a crucial role in facilitating communication and ensuring the reliability of information management. The integration of digital technologies into our operations is vital for optimizing our business processes and enhancing our market responsiveness.

Our insurance segment, which includes Global Atlantic, has seen significant growth in net investment income due to an increase in average assets under management and higher yields. The management of insurance liabilities requires sophisticated data management and analytics capabilities to ensure that we can meet future policy obligations. The valuation of embedded derivatives and other financial instruments is influenced by market conditions and requires robust information processing capabilities. 

The competitive landscape necessitates that we continuously innovate and adapt our strategies to align with market demands. Our ability to leverage technology resources and enhance our IT capabilities is essential for driving performance gains and achieving our organizational goals. The challenges posed by regulatory contexts and economic uncertainties require strategic resource allocation and effective governance practices to navigate successfully.

Our operational effectiveness is further supported by our commitment to process optimization and the development of internal capabilities. The strategic decisions we make regarding investments and resource deployment are informed by comprehensive data analytics and performance metrics. The alignment of our business strategy with technological advancements is crucial for maintaining our competitive positioning in the market. 

As we continue to evolve our business model, the integration of IT capabilities into our operational framework will remain a priority, enabling us to respond agilely to changing market conditions and consumer demands.

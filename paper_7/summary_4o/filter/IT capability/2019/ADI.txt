The following discussion includes a comparison of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for the fiscal year ended November 2, 2019, and the fiscal year ended November 3, 2018. Our fiscal year is the 52-week or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to the last day in October. The acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation on March 10, 2017, has been significant in transforming our capabilities, as it involved the integration of technology resources and management skills that enhance our operational efficiency and support business strategies. The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points, including the technical characteristics of the product, which reflects our commitment to evolving our information management capability to provide data and information with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, and reliability. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time, indicating our adaptability to market dynamics and consumer demands. We believe that a continued commitment to research and development is essential to maintain product leadership and provide innovative new product offerings, which aligns with our strategic resource allocation and investment decisions. Our ongoing assessments of global macroeconomic conditions inform our operational effectiveness and efficiency, as well as our alignment of expenses with revenues. The repositioning actions undertaken in fiscal 2019, aimed at aligning our workforce skill set with our long-term strategic plan, underscore the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other capabilities. The increase in gross margin percentage in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, was partially due to a mix shift in favor of higher margin products resulting from the acquisition, which reflects our strategic management practices in enhancing organizational capabilities. We expect that our existing sources of liquidity and cash generated from future operations will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, and dividend payments, demonstrating our operational flexibility and commitment to business transformation. The adoption of new revenue accounting rules has also necessitated changes in our revenue recognition policy, which reflects our focus on strategic alignment and operational efficiency. The evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results, which are critical to our performance outcomes and organizational effectiveness. Our strategic management practices involve assessing the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit fair values, allowing us to reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units to our current market capitalization. The significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues and operating income margins are essential for determining the fair value of our reporting units, which in turn impacts our overall business performance and strategic capabilities. The integration of technology capabilities and the management of our technology portfolio are vital to our competitive positioning and market responsiveness, ensuring that we remain a competitive force in the industry.

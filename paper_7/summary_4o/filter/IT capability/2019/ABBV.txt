Abbvie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, advancing and investing in its pipeline, and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. The company intends to continue to advance its mission by growing revenues through diversifying revenue streams, ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches, and driving late-stage pipeline assets to the market. Abbvie remains committed to driving continued expansion of operating margins and expects to achieve this objective through continued leverage from revenue growth, productivity initiatives in supply chain, and ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs, and general corporate expenses. The combination of Abbvie and Allergan will create a diverse entity with leadership positions across various medical specialties, enhancing Abbvie's existing product portfolio and pipeline with numerous Allergan assets, while benefiting from Abbvie's commercial strength, expertise, and international infrastructure. Abbvie's long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. The company has approximately 60 compounds or indications in clinical development, with a focus on important medical specialties, and is committed to leveraging its research and innovation capabilities to drive business transformation and enhance firm performance. Abbvie's financial performance reflects continued funding to support all stages of its emerging pipeline assets and investment in on-market brands, which underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. The company monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers, and government regulations, which are critical for effective resource management and operational flexibility. Abbvie's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt, or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by material declines in demand for its products or changes in business conditions. The effective management of its IT capabilities, including information management and data analytics, is essential for supporting business needs and enhancing operational efficiency. The company’s strategic objectives include the completion and successful integration of the proposed Allergan acquisition, effective management of international biosimilar erosion, and the favorable impact of pipeline products and indications recently approved or currently under regulatory review. Abbvie's commitment to innovation and strategic resource allocation is evident in its ongoing investments in research and development, which are fundamental to maintaining competitive advantage and responding to market dynamics. The company’s focus on operational efficiency, business process management, and technology integration is aimed at optimizing performance outcomes and ensuring organizational effectiveness in a rapidly changing business environment.

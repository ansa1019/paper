Mastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses, and other organizations worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks. We make payments easier and more efficient by providing a wide range of payment solutions and services using our family of well-known brands. Our payment solutions offer customers choice and flexibility and are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments system. The primary drivers of our net revenue growth were switched transaction growth and other revenues growth, which includes contributions from our cyber and intelligence and data and services solutions. Our continued investment in strategic initiatives has driven growth in operating expenses, reflecting our commitment to enhancing our IT capabilities and supporting business needs. We have additional payment capabilities that include automated clearing house transactions and integrated value-added offerings such as cyber and intelligence products, information and analytics services, consulting, loyalty and reward programs, and processing. Our operational flexibility is supported by our unique and proprietary global payments network, which we refer to as our core network, through which we switch payment transactions and deliver related products and services. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities balances, along with our cash flow generating capabilities, are sufficient to satisfy our future operating cash needs and capital asset purchases. Our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions and the outcome of any legal or regulatory proceedings. We rely on existing liquidity, cash generated from operations, and access to capital to fund our global operations and investments in our business. Our technology infrastructure and IT governance are critical in managing our operational efficiency and supporting our strategic resource allocation. We continuously evaluate our technology deployment and investment decisions to enhance our IT capabilities, which are essential for maintaining competitive advantage and responding to market dynamics. Our ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities has become key in transforming our firm into a competitive force.

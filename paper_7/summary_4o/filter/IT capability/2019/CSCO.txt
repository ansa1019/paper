Cisco designs and sells a broad range of technologies that have been powering the internet since 1984. Across networking, security, collaboration, applications, and the cloud, Cisco is integrating intent-based technologies to help customers manage more users, devices, and things connecting to their networks. This integration enables the provision of a highly secure, intelligent platform for digital business. The company remains focused on accelerating innovation across its portfolio and believes it has made continued progress on its strategic priorities. Cisco's strategic priorities include accelerating the pace of innovation, increasing the value of the network, and transforming its business model. The firm’s IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources, such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, and business process understanding, to further organizational goals. Cisco continues to operate in a challenging and highly competitive environment, expecting ongoing uncertainty in the service provider customer market. Despite this, the company continues to aggressively invest in priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term. The increase in product revenue reflects growth in infrastructure platforms, applications, and security, and the company is transitioning its business model to increased software and subscriptions. The firm’s revenue management is organized geographically, with product revenue growth driven by enterprise, public sector, and commercial markets, partially offset by a decline in the service provider market. The infrastructure platforms product category represents core networking offerings related to switching, routing, wireless, and data center, with revenue growth driven by sales of intent-based networking and SD-WAN products. The applications product category includes collaboration offerings and analytics software, with double-digit growth in unified communications and IoT software. Revenue from the security product category increased significantly, driven by higher sales of various security products, including those from the recent acquisition of Duo Security. Cisco's gross margin increased due to productivity improvements, although it faced unfavorable impacts from pricing and product mix. The firm is committed to maintaining supply chain flexibility to ensure competitive lead times while managing the risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. The company’s financing arrangements include leases, loans, and financed service contracts, with an expectation to expand the use of financing programs. Cisco believes its strong cash position allows for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, customer financing activities, and share repurchases. The firm’s liquidity and capital resources are expected to satisfy its requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, and other operational needs. Cisco's ongoing evaluation of its non-marketable equity and other investments is crucial for determining potential impairments and ensuring alignment with its strategic goals. The company’s approach to IT capability emphasizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to transform the firm into a competitive force.

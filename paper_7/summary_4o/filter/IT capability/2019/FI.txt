We are a leading global provider of financial services technology. Our operations are comprised of segments that provide a range of technology resources, including account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, and internet and mobile banking systems. The acquisition of First Data Corporation has expanded our portfolio of services and enhanced our capabilities in merchant acquiring, e-commerce, and mobile commerce. This acquisition is expected to deliver integration value and enhance client relationships, particularly in digital and payment solutions, thereby supporting our strategic initiatives to improve operational effectiveness and differentiate our products through innovation. The global payments landscape continues to evolve with rapidly advancing technologies, necessitating modernization of technology and enhancement of customer experience to meet rising business and consumer expectations. Financial institutions are increasingly focused on solutions that help them win and retain customers, comply with regulations, and enhance operating efficiency, which drives their investment in technology to manage information and process transactions. We anticipate that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources in technology to remain competitive in this evolving marketplace. Our focus on long-term client relationships, combined with our position as a provider of non-discretionary, recurring revenue-based products and services, supports our growth strategy. The integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for clients, providing new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce costs. Our strategic initiatives also include active portfolio management and enhancing the value of existing client relationships, which are critical for leveraging our IT capabilities to support business needs and drive performance gains. The evolving regulatory and cybersecurity landscape presents challenges for financial institutions, further emphasizing the need for robust IT governance and management capabilities. As we continue to implement integration plans post-acquisition, we are focused on reducing costs and improving efficiencies, which will enhance our operational flexibility and overall effectiveness. The demand for products that facilitate customer interaction through digital channels is expected to increase, creating additional revenue opportunities. Our investments in technology infrastructure and capabilities are aimed at optimizing processes and enhancing our service offerings, thereby aligning with market dynamics and consumer demands. We are committed to leveraging our IT resources to support our strategic objectives and enhance our organizational capabilities, ensuring we remain a competitive force in the financial services technology sector.

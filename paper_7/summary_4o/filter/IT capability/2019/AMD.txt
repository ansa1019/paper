The introduction of our 7 nanometer product portfolio in 2019 marked a significant milestone in our journey, showcasing our capability to execute our product roadmap and introduce high-performance products. The computing and graphics segment net revenue increased by 14%, primarily driven by a richer mix of client processors due to strong demand for our Ryzen processors, highlighting our ability to respond to market dynamics and consumer choice. Our operating income improved, reflecting higher sales and effective management of operational efficiency. The enterprise, embedded and semi-custom segment also demonstrated resilience, with increased operating income due to higher sales of our EPYC server processors, illustrating our strategic resource allocation and capability to leverage technology resources effectively. 

We recognize the importance of information management capability, which encompasses our ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, and security. This capability is critical in transforming our firm into a competitive force, as it underscores the mobilization and deployment of IT-based resources in conjunction with other organizational capabilities.

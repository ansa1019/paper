During the year ended December 31, 2019, operating fundamentals remained strong for our O&M portfolio, which is impacted by our development, acquisition, and disposition activities. Our financial condition and results of operations reflect the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. The operating fundamentals in the markets in which we operate continue to be strong, which has increased rents and kept occupancies high. We evaluate our business operations based on the NOI of our two operating segments: real estate operations and strategic capital. NOI by segment is a non-GAAP performance measure that helps management and investors understand our operating results. We consider NOI by segment to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance because it reflects our ability to effectively support business needs through the application of IT capabilities. The strategic capital segment includes revenues from asset and property management, other fees for services performed, and promote revenue earned from the unconsolidated entities, which fluctuate due to changes in the size of the portfolios through acquisitions and dispositions. Our ability to generate cash from operating activities, distributions from our co-investment ventures, and available financing sources is adequate to meet our anticipated future development, acquisition, operating, and debt service requirements. We capitalize certain internal costs related to our development activities, which reflects our strategic resource allocation and operational flexibility in managing our investments. The strategic capital revenues are influenced by our management of technology resources and the operational efficiency of our processes. We recognize the importance of IT governance and the management skills required to navigate market dynamics and external influences. Our investments in technology infrastructure and digital transformation initiatives are critical for enhancing our operational capabilities and achieving competitive advantage. We also assess the performance linkage between our IT capabilities and overall firm performance, which is essential for maintaining market responsiveness and agility. The integration of IT systems into our business processes supports our strategic management practices and enhances our organizational effectiveness. We focus on actionable investments that leverage our IT capabilities to optimize resource deployment and improve performance outcomes. Our operational decisions are guided by the need for information accuracy, reliability, and timeliness, which are fundamental to our information management capabilities. The ongoing evaluation of our technology portfolio and the strategic alignment of our IT resources with business needs are pivotal for sustaining our competitive positioning in the market. As we continue to transform our business through innovation and process optimization, our IT capabilities will play a crucial role in supporting our organizational goals and enhancing our overall business value.

Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions, and governments to fast, secure, and reliable electronic payments. We provide our financial institution clients with a global payments infrastructure and support services for the delivery of visa-branded payment products. Our business performance reflects the impacts of overall economic conditions and consumer spending, which influence our operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation. We continue to explore opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment solutions we provide, which involves leveraging technology resources and capabilities to support business needs and drive innovation. Our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on visa-branded cards and payment products, as well as the number of transactions processed on our network. The growth in processed transactions and nominal payments volume is critical for our service revenues and data processing revenues, which are influenced by our investments in technology assets and infrastructure. We recognize the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other resources to achieve organizational goals and enhance operational efficiency. Our investments in technology infrastructure are aimed at supporting our digital solutions and core business initiatives, which are essential for maintaining market agility and responding to competitive actions. The increase in personnel expenses is primarily due to our strategy to invest in internal technology resources, reflecting our commitment to capability enhancement and organizational effectiveness. We have also entered into various contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients to build payments volume and increase visa-branded card acceptance, which are designed to optimize our business processes and improve performance outcomes. Our financial results indicate a strong linkage between our IT capabilities and market-based performance, as we continue to adapt to changing business environments and consumer demands. The acquisition of Visa Europe is expected to further enhance our technology capabilities and expand our operational footprint, aligning with our strategic management practices and long-term growth objectives. We believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our operational needs, which are supported by our ongoing investments in technology and infrastructure. The effective management of our technology portfolio is vital for ensuring that we remain competitive in the evolving payments landscape, as we strive to deliver value creation through innovation and enhanced customer relationships. Our strategic decisions are guided by a focus on information management capability, ensuring that we provide accurate, timely, and reliable data to our stakeholders, which is essential for informed decision-making and performance improvement.

AbbVie’s strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, advancing and investing in its pipeline, and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. The company’s financial performance in 2015 included delivering fully diluted earnings per share of $3.13, which reflects the operational efficiencies and favorable product mix across its portfolio. AbbVie’s mission is to be an innovation-driven, patient-focused specialty biopharmaceutical company capable of achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution and a consistent stream of innovative new medicines. The company intends to continue to advance its mission by growing revenues through continued strong performance from its existing portfolio, expanding gross and operating margins, and investing in its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology, and virology. AbbVie’s pipeline currently includes more than 50 compounds or indications in clinical development, which are focused on important medical specialties such as immunology, oncology, and neurology. The company expects to achieve its revenue growth objectives through driving biologic penetration across disease categories, increasing market leadership, and strong commercial execution. AbbVie also anticipates several regulatory submissions and key data readouts from key clinical trials. The acquisition of Pharmacyclics is expected to accelerate AbbVie’s clinical and commercial presence in oncology, strengthen its pipeline, and establish a leadership position in hematological oncology. The company’s financial results reflect continued funding in support of its emerging mid- and late-stage pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVie’s growth brands. AbbVie’s research and innovation are the cornerstones of its business, and its long-term success depends on its ability to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products. The company has augmented its pipeline through strategic licensing and partnering activities, which are critical for enhancing its capabilities and ensuring competitive positioning in the market. AbbVie’s financial position and liquidity are supported by cash flows from operations, which were $7.5 billion in 2015, enabling the company to invest in its pipeline and return cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. The company’s operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation are essential in navigating market dynamics and ensuring that it can respond effectively to competitive actions and external influences. AbbVie continues to monitor economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers, and government regulations, which are vital for managing its operational and financial risks. The company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms is crucial for supporting its growth objectives and maintaining its competitive advantage in the biopharmaceutical industry.

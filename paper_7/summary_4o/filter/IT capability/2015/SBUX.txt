Starbucks' results for fiscal 2015 demonstrate the continued strength of our global business model and our ability to successfully make disciplined investments in our business and our partners (employees). The increase in comparable store sales was primarily driven by growth in our core beverages, paired with the success of our food offerings and beverage innovation, which reflects our focus on business innovation and technology deployment. The Americas segment continued to perform well, with revenues growing primarily driven by comparable store sales growth, as well as incremental revenues from net new store openings. Looking forward, we expect to continue to drive revenue growth and moderate margin expansion through new stores and leveraging investments in both our store partners and our digital platforms, such as mobile order and pay, which indicates a strategic alignment with digital technologies and operational flexibility. Our capital expenditures are expected to support ongoing growth initiatives, including systems and technology investments in our stores and in the support infrastructure, highlighting the importance of IT capability in enhancing business strategies and work processes. The ownership change in Starbucks Japan reflects a shift in our operational model, which has implications for our information management capability and the coordination of our assets and internal processes. Investments in our digital platforms related to in-store initiatives are expected to enhance customer relationships and operational efficiency, demonstrating the integration of technology capabilities into our business processes. We anticipate that continued investments in our technology infrastructure will facilitate improved performance metrics and organizational effectiveness. Additionally, the expansion of our retail store presence and increasing transaction growth in China indicates our responsiveness to market dynamics and consumer demands. Our strategic resource allocation and investment decisions are focused on leveraging existing capabilities and further building our business in support of our growth agenda. We believe that future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses and shareholder distributions. Changes in our business strategy, including the shift to more licensed stores, reflect our ongoing efforts to optimize our operational capabilities and enhance our competitive positioning. The overall increase in operating margin was driven by strong sales leverage and strategic management practices, which are essential for maintaining market agility and responding to external influences. The combination of these factors underscores the critical role of IT capability in transforming our firm into a competitive force and achieving performance excellence.

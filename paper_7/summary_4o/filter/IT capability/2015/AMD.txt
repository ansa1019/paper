We faced a challenging business environment in 2015, with the impact of global macro-economic conditions contributing to a decrease in demand for our products. Additionally, competitive pressures contributed to an overall challenging year. During 2015, we continued to focus on introducing a more diverse product portfolio. As part of our long-term strategy to deliver great products, we introduced a number of new products in 2015, including our 6th generation AMD A-series mobile processors and various graphics products designed to reinforce our graphics leadership. We also expanded our AMD FirePro server GPU family designed for high-performance compute environments. Our restructuring plan in 2015, which included outsourcing certain IT services and application development, was aimed at simplifying our business and better aligning resources around our priorities and business outlook. The 2015 restructuring plan resulted in operational savings, primarily in operating expenses, and is expected to yield further savings in 2016. We made important changes to our business, including a workforce reduction and the consolidation of certain real estate facilities. Our operational flexibility was enhanced through these strategic decisions, which were guided by our focus on aligning resources with business needs and market dynamics. The decline in operating performance in 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in net revenue and gross margin, as we experienced reduced demand from our original equipment manufacturers in advance of the launch of Microsoft Windows 10. The decrease in revenue was attributed to lower client processor sales and lower server and embedded revenue. We also took steps to simplify our business and better align resources around our priorities and business outlook. Our cash and cash equivalents balance, along with the savings from our restructuring plans, is expected to be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, over the next 12 months. We believe that in the event we decide to obtain external funding, we may be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Our total purchases from GlobalFoundries related to wafer manufacturing and research and development activities were substantial, reflecting our ongoing commitment to resource allocation in support of our operational capabilities. The equity interest purchase agreement with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. is expected to enhance our operational capabilities by providing assembly, testing, marking, packing, and packaging services. The transaction will result in the joint ventures providing critical support to our operations, which underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other capabilities. We continue to evaluate our investment choices and strategic resource allocation to enhance our IT capabilities, which are essential for transforming our firm into a competitive force in the market.

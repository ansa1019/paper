During the twelve months ended June 30, 2015, we focused our attention on our global human capital management (HCM) strategy, which reflects the strength of our underlying business model and our success in the market. Our commitment to service excellence lies at the core of our relationship with each of our clients, and we believe our success in HCM requires deep expertise and outstanding service to help our clients manage their employees and build better workforces. Our business strategy is predicated on our ability to drive innovation and service excellence, which includes investing to grow and scale our HR business process outsourcing solutions by leveraging our platforms and processes. The increased focus on product development and the high demand for additional HCM solutions, including products that assist businesses in complying with the Affordable Care Act, led our salesforce to deliver exceptionally strong new business bookings, reflecting our operational efficiency and capability to respond to market dynamics. Systems development and programming costs increased due to investments in product innovation and the costs to develop, support, and maintain our products, which are essential for enhancing our IT capabilities. Our total expenses increased primarily due to investments in product innovation and expenses related to the increase in new business bookings. This investment in technology resources is critical for maintaining our competitive advantage and supporting our growing revenue. We recognize the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to transform our firm into a competitive force. Our strategic pillars include leveraging our global presence to offer clients HCM solutions where they do business, which emphasizes the integration of technology capabilities into our service offerings. The increase in our average client funds balance and the strong client revenue retention rate demonstrate our effective management of resources and operational flexibility. Our financial performance reflects the successful alignment of our business strategy with technology deployment, which enhances our ability to meet client needs and respond to external influences. We continue to enhance value for our shareholders through consistent revenue growth and effective resource allocation, which are supported by our IT governance and management capabilities. The strategic decisions made in fiscal 2015, including the separation of our former dealer services business, highlight our commitment to innovation and transformation within our organizational structure. Our focus on technology functionalities and the integration of digital infrastructure into our operations positions us to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the market. The emphasis on operational efficiency and the ability to adapt to changing business needs are critical components of our overall strategy, ensuring that we remain agile in a competitive environment.

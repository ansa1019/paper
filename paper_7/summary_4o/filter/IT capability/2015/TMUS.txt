The ongoing success of our un-carrier proposition and continued modernization of our network has further repositioned T-Mobile to provide customers with an exceptional customer experience, which requires substantial investment in our business. We have substantially completed the process of upgrading our network to LTE, which provides our customers with the fastest nationwide 4G LTE network in the United States. Our ability to acquire and retain branded customers is important to our business in the generation of revenues, and we have continued to focus on retaining customers through our un-carrier initiatives and ongoing network improvements. These initiatives have continued to provide an improved customer experience as evidenced by our strong improvement in branded postpaid phone churn. The increase in branded postpaid revenues was primarily attributable to growth in the number of average branded postpaid customers driven by strong customer response to our un-carrier initiatives and promotions for services and devices. Additionally, we are currently in the process of building out our network to utilize our 700 MHz A-block spectrum licenses, which enhances our technology portfolio and operational capabilities. Our cash capital expenditures for property and equipment were $4.5 billion in 2015, reflecting our commitment to technology deployment and infrastructure capability. We intend to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses in private party transactions and future FCC spectrum license auctions to further enhance our portfolio of U.S. nationwide broadband spectrum and enable the expansion of LTE coverage to new markets. The comparability of results in this form 10-K to the year ended 2013 is affected by the inclusion of MetroPCS results after the completion of the business combination. The ongoing investment in our network infrastructure is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and operational efficiency. We believe that our strategic resource allocation towards network modernization and customer experience enhancement will drive future performance gains and market agility. Our management practices emphasize the importance of leveraging IT capabilities to support business needs and enhance overall organizational effectiveness. The introduction of Jump! on Demand allows customers to lease a new wireless device and upgrade it for a new one, which reflects our focus on innovative business processes and technology functionalities. The increase in customer adoption of upgrade and insurance programs, as well as the growth in regulatory program revenues, further demonstrates our ability to respond to market dynamics and consumer demands. We regularly review and update projections for changes in current and projected financial and operating results, general economic conditions, and the competitive landscape. Our strategic management practices facilitate key operating performance comparisons with other companies in the wireless industry, highlighting our commitment to operational flexibility and resource management. The financial condition of the parent, issuer, and guarantor subsidiaries is substantially similar to the company's consolidated financial condition, reflecting our integrated approach to organizational performance and resource deployment. Our commitment to information management capability ensures that we provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, and security, which is critical for supporting our business strategies and enhancing customer relationships.

In this annual report, we continued to focus on our strategy to improve our business, which included strengthening our competitive position and enhancing our financial performance. The improvement in operating performance was due to an increase in net revenue, a reduction in restructuring and other special charges, and a licensing gain related to an intellectual property license agreement. We executed our roadmap by delivering new products and technologies across our business segments, which are designed to provide productivity and performance with maximum mobility for consumers. Our research and development expenses increased, primarily due to product engineering and design costs, reflecting our commitment to enhancing our technology capabilities. The enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment saw an increase in net revenue driven by higher unit shipments of semi-custom system-on-chip products, indicating a positive market response to our technology deployment. We also formed joint ventures to expand our market presence and support our expansion into the server product market in China, which underscores our strategic resource allocation and capability leverage. The sixth amendment to our wafer supply agreement with GlobalFoundries provides us with greater flexibility in sourcing foundry services across our product portfolio and establishes a framework for technology collaboration, which is essential for our operational efficiency and innovation capabilities. Our total purchases related to wafer manufacturing and research and development activities reflect our ongoing investment in technology resources. The licensing agreement with the joint venture is expected to generate royalty income based on product sales, further enhancing our information management capability and supporting our business transformation efforts. The strategic decisions made during the year, including the exit from certain business lines and the restructuring of operations, were aimed at aligning our resources with our business goals and improving overall organizational effectiveness. We continue to monitor market dynamics and external influences that could impact our performance, ensuring that we remain agile and responsive to consumer demands and competitive actions. The ongoing evaluation of our financial condition and results of operations is critical in understanding the impact of our strategic initiatives on firm performance and market-based performance metrics. Our focus on digital transformation and IT capability development is evident in our product offerings and operational strategies, which are designed to enhance our competitive advantage and drive value creation. As we navigate the complexities of the business environment, our commitment to leveraging technology functionalities and capabilities remains a cornerstone of our strategic management practices.

We have invested in a variety of technologies that have allowed us to achieve efficiencies and increase our investments in real estate with minimal increases to general and administrative expenses. We will continue to leverage these technologies in order to further streamline our operations and reduce our costs as a percentage of assets under management, along with advanced data analysis to enhance decision making. Our plan to grow revenues, earnings, and cash flows is based on maintaining control of well-positioned land and realizing value through development. The carrying value of our land bank is below its current fair value, and we expect to realize this value primarily through development. Our owned and managed real estate assets have increased significantly, and we have integrated these assets with only minimal increases in overhead related to property management and leasing functions. The operating fundamentals in the markets we operate continue to improve, positively affecting both rental rates and occupancy, which fuels development activity. We evaluate our business operations based on the net operating income of our business reporting segments, which helps management and investors understand the core operations of our business. Our owned and managed portfolio includes operating properties and does not include properties under development or held for sale. We believe reviewing these fundamentals allows management to understand the entire impact on the financial statements. Our strategic capital segment includes revenues from asset management and other fees, which fluctuate based on the size of co-investment ventures under management and the timing of promotes. We allocate costs of property management functions to the real estate operations segment and the strategic capital segment based on the size of the relative portfolios. Our technology investments have enhanced our operational efficiency and decision-making capabilities, enabling us to respond effectively to market dynamics. We have experienced an increase in rental rates on turnover of existing leases, resulting in higher average rental rates in our portfolio and increased rental revenues. We have also generated cash from contributions and dispositions of real estate properties, which supports our strategic objective of owning a portfolio of high-quality properties. Our ability to generate cash from operating activities, distributions from co-investment ventures, and available financing sources is considered adequate to meet our anticipated future development and acquisition requirements. We expect to fund our cash needs principally from fees earned for services performed on behalf of co-investment ventures, distributions received from these ventures, and proceeds from the disposition of properties. We have a significant amount of third-party debt in our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, and we work with these ventures to refinance their maturing debt. We assess our ability to control an entity, including whether the entity is a variable interest entity, which affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated financial statements. Our investments in technology and data management have been critical in enhancing our operational capabilities and achieving competitive advantages in the market.

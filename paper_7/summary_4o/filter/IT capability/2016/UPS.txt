We have continued to undertake several initiatives to improve flexibility and capacity in our transportation network, improve yield management, and increase operational efficiency and contain costs across all segments. Productivity improvements have continued to be realized through adjusting our air and ground networks to better match volume levels and utilizing technology to increase package sorting and delivery efficiency. The continued deployment of Orion has contained the average daily vehicle miles driven even as package volume increased. Our broad portfolio of product offerings and the flexibilities inherent in our transportation network have helped us adapt to changing trends, particularly in e-commerce and omni-channel retail sales, which have driven package volume demand for residential products. The growth in e-commerce has driven demand for our SurePost service, with volume increasing significantly.

In 2016, we continued to invest, based on our roadmap, in our most developed ecosystem, the Facebook app and platform as well as video, driving growth and building ecosystems around our products and features that already have significant user bases, such as Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and long-term technology initiatives that we believe will further our mission to connect the world, such as virtual reality and artificial intelligence. We anticipate our expenses in 2017 will continue to grow as we execute on priorities such as hiring top engineering talent, investing in research and development, content, and sales and marketing efforts, and expanding our data center capacity and office facilities to support our rapid growth. The increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure was a significant factor driving the cost of revenue in 2016. Our research and development expenses increased due to a growth in employee headcount in engineering and other technical functions, reflecting our commitment to enhancing our IT capabilities. We plan to continue to accelerate the hiring of software engineers and other technical employees and increasing our investment to support our research and development initiatives. The most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in news feed, with mobile advertising revenue representing approximately 83% of total advertising revenue in 2016. Factors influencing our advertising revenue growth included an increase in demand for our ad inventory, driven by an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on Facebook, and an increase in mobile user growth and engagement. Our advertising revenue growth was also supported by the quality, relevance, and performance of our ads. We expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in regions with relatively lower average revenue per user, which may affect our overall revenue growth. We believe that our IT capabilities, including the ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access, are critical in responding to changing business needs and directions. Our IT investment strategy emphasizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. We recognize that our IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, and business process understanding to further organizational goals. The integration of technology into our business processes is essential for enhancing operational efficiency and achieving competitive advantage in the market. Our commitment to continuous improvement in our IT architecture and infrastructure is aimed at optimizing our operational flexibility and ensuring we can respond effectively to market dynamics. As we continue to evolve our IT capabilities, we remain focused on aligning our technology investments with our strategic objectives to drive performance gains and enhance our organizational effectiveness.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes. Our company is a holding company whose subsidiaries and affiliates are engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and other nicotine-containing products. We manage our business in four segments, and our products are sold in more than 180 markets, where they hold significant market share positions. We have a range of reduced-risk products (RRPs) in various stages of development and commercialization, which present lower quantities of harmful compounds compared to traditional products. Our net revenues and operating income are influenced by various factors, including product volume, pricing, and currency exchange rates. The mix of products sold also affects our financial performance, as it refers to the proportionate value of different brand categories and shipment volumes in various markets. Our marketing, administration, and research costs include expenses related to product development and general corporate operations. As a holding company, our principal sources of funds are dividends and debt repayments from subsidiaries. The changes in our reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) reflect various factors, including asset impairment and exit costs, tax items, and changes in currency rates. Our effective income tax rate has seen slight fluctuations, influenced by earnings mix and repatriation costs. The unfavorable currency impact during the reporting period has affected profitability across our primary revenue markets. Higher pricing and lower marketing costs have been observed in several regions, although these have been partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix dynamics. Our forecast for future performance indicates expected growth in diluted EPS, driven by net revenue growth exceeding our annual growth target range. This forecast does not account for potential acquisitions or unusual events that may arise. The factors described in the risk factors section represent ongoing risks to this forecast. The discussion of critical accounting estimates provides further insights into the financial condition and results of operations. The ability to effectively support business needs through IT capabilities has become a key element in transforming our firm into a competitive force, emphasizing the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in conjunction with other organizational capabilities. The application of IT resources, including technology and management skills, is essential to achieving our organizational goals and enhancing overall performance.

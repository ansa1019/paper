In 2021, we continued to invest based on company priorities, including building new experiences that meaningfully improve people's lives today and set the stage for even bigger improvements in the future, which underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. Our advertising revenue growth was adversely affected by reduced marketer spending due to limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the iOS operating system, highlighting the challenges in our IT capabilities to adapt to external influences and regulatory changes. We anticipate that additional investments in our data center capacity, servers, network infrastructure, and office facilities will continue to drive expense growth, which reflects our commitment to enhancing our technology infrastructure to support user growth and engagement. Our research and development expenses increased significantly as we focused on hiring software engineers and other technical employees to support our initiatives in both our family of products and reality labs, demonstrating our strategic resource allocation towards enhancing our IT capabilities. The growth in our family of apps metrics indicates a strong engagement across our products, which is facilitated by our IT systems and the effective deployment of technology functionalities. We view daily active people and monthly active users as measures of engagement across our products, relying on complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using our products, indicating our reliance on data management and information processing capabilities. The increase in the number of ads delivered was driven by increases in users and the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products, which reflects our operational efficiency and the effectiveness of our IT capabilities in supporting business needs. Our capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were substantial, indicating our ongoing commitment to investing in technology resources that enhance our operational flexibility and business transformation efforts. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on user growth and engagement has been significant, and we believe this growth has moderated in many regions, which may continue to affect our advertising revenue growth and reflects the dynamic capabilities of our organization to respond to environmental factors. We expect our year-over-year total expense growth rates may significantly exceed our year-over-year revenue growth rates, which would adversely affect our operating margin and profitability, emphasizing the need for strategic management practices in resource deployment. Our ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and access is critical to our business processes and overall organizational effectiveness. The ongoing evolution of our IT capabilities is essential in transforming our firm into a competitive force, as we continue to leverage technology to enhance customer relationships and drive business value.

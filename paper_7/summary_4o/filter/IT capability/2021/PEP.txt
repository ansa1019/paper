Our discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition and is provided as an addition to, and should be read in connection with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. We are driven by an approach called PepsiCo Positive (pep+), which is a strategic end-to-end transformation of our business, with sustainability at the center of how the company will strive to create growth and value by operating within planetary boundaries and inspiring positive change for the planet and people. Pep+ drives action and progress across three key pillars, including positive agriculture, positive value chain, and positive choices, which collectively aim to enhance our operational capabilities and align with evolving consumer demands. Our business operations are influenced by a highly competitive operating environment, a rapidly changing retail landscape, and the need for operational flexibility, particularly in response to supply chain disruptions and shifting consumer preferences. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and seek to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities, such as expanding our direct-to-consumer business. The achievement of our strategic and operating objectives involves taking risks, and we leverage an integrated risk management framework to identify, assess, prioritize, and address top strategic, financial, operating, compliance, safety, reputational, and other risks. Our risk management office provides ongoing guidance, tools, and analytical support to facilitate communication between the parties involved, including our board of directors. We have implemented health and safety protocols, business continuity plans, and crisis management protocols to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 on our employees and business. Our operations are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, certain taxes, and environmental matters, and we recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable and estimable. Our technology management strategy includes leveraging new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize, and automate processes, re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. We regularly evaluate productivity initiatives and other structural changes to enhance our operational efficiency and effectiveness. The 2019 productivity plan, which has been expanded and extended through the end of 2026, aims to leverage technology to simplify our organization and optimize our operations. We also engage in a variety of research and development activities to drive innovation globally, and our investment strategy includes a well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities to achieve our long-term return expectations. Our financial results are influenced by market risks arising from adverse changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, and interest rates, which we manage through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives and hedging. We are committed to maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and regularly assess the effectiveness of our risk management and operational processes to support our strategic objectives.

The outbreak of COVID-19 continues to impact the United States and other countries throughout the world, causing disruptions to our business and adversely affecting our financial results. Economic and market conditions significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations, influencing the values of the investments we make, our ability to exit these investments profitably, and our ability to raise capital from investors. Global and regional economic conditions, including those caused by the pandemic, have substantial impacts on our financial performance and operational flexibility. The competitive landscape is characterized by significant market volatility, which can present opportunities to invest at reduced valuations that position us for future growth and investment returns. Technological advancements and innovations may disrupt marketplaces and businesses, necessitating a focus on operational efficiency and strategic resource allocation. Our ability to attract new capital and investors is driven by the perception of the alternative asset management industry as an attractive means for capital appreciation or income. The integration of our insurance business with our asset management operations enhances our investment management capabilities and provides a diversified approach to capital allocation. We have expanded into strategies such as real assets, credit, and impact investing, which require effective management of technology resources and capabilities to meet evolving business needs. Our operational processes are designed to optimize performance linkage and enhance organizational effectiveness, allowing us to respond agilely to market dynamics. The management of our investment portfolio is influenced by various economic conditions and events outside of our control, which may have a significant impact on the valuation of our investments. We continuously monitor the performance of our investments and the associated risks, including those related to technology deployment and information management. Our strategic decisions are informed by the need to leverage our IT capabilities to support business innovation and transformation, ensuring that we remain competitive in a rapidly changing environment. The integration of digital technologies into our operational framework enhances our ability to manage data effectively and supports our decision-making processes. As we navigate the complexities of the current business environment, our focus remains on maximizing value creation through the strategic alignment of our resources and capabilities, including our IT infrastructure and governance practices. The evolving nature of our IT capabilities underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other organizational resources to enhance our overall performance and competitive positioning.

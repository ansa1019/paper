In 2021, we introduced a number of high-performance products, including the AMD Ryzen mobile processor family and the AMD Ryzen Pro series mobile processors, designed to provide powerful computing experiences with security features for demanding business environments like remote working. Our AMD Instinct MI200 series accelerators, optimized for HPC and AI/ML workloads, represent a significant advancement in our technology capabilities. The introduction of the AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution software for game developers aims to enhance the gaming experience, showcasing our commitment to innovation in technology functionalities. Our next-generation AMD EPYC processors include security features through AMD Infinity Guard, which help drive faster times to results and improve business outcomes. Despite challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we maintained a stable supply of materials to meet production requirements and secured additional capacity through strategic investments in our supply chain. This included amending our wafer supply agreement with GlobalFoundries to ensure a minimum annual capacity allocation, demonstrating our proactive approach to resource allocation and operational flexibility. Our financial performance reflects strong customer demand and improved margins, driven by a richer mix of EPYC, Radeon, and Ryzen processor sales. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher revenue and improved margins, which more than offset higher operating expenses. Our research and development expenses increased significantly, reflecting our focus on enhancing our technology capabilities and product development. The strategic investments made in our technology portfolio are aimed at establishing AMD as a leader in high-performance computing, with a focus on meeting evolving business needs and market dynamics. Our operational activities, including cash collections from customers and payments for inventory, are essential for maintaining our liquidity and capital resources. As of December 25, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents were $3.6 billion, positioning us well to fund operations and capital expenditures. We believe our ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources, in combination with leveraging other capabilities, is crucial for transforming AMD into a competitive force in the market. The ongoing evaluation of our financial condition and results of operations is integral to understanding how our strategic resource allocation and management practices impact our overall performance and business value. We continue to assess the effectiveness of our IT governance and capabilities in supporting our organizational goals and enhancing our operational efficiency, ensuring that we remain responsive to market changes and consumer demands.

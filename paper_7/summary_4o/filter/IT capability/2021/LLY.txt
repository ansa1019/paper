Management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition highlights the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. The evolving scope of information technology capabilities encompasses the coordination of a firm’s assets and internal processes and their interfirm transactions and relationships. Our focus includes information management capability, which is the ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access, and to tailor these in response to changing business needs and directions. The firm’s IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, business process understanding, and human resources to further organizational goals. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business and operations, affecting development, manufacturing, supply, distribution, and sales of our medicines. We have faced risks related to our COVID-19 therapies, including heightened regulatory scrutiny and the unpredictable nature of pandemics, which could further negatively impact or eliminate demand for our therapies. Our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire, develop, and commercialize innovative new medicines, which requires effective management of our research and development spending across our portfolio. We recognize that the ability to adapt to market dynamics and competitive actions is crucial for maintaining our market position. Our investments in large-scale manufacturing and technology infrastructure are intended to ensure rapid access to patients and to enhance our operational efficiency. We also engage in business development activities to enhance our pipeline and strengthen our business through acquisitions, collaborations, and licensing arrangements. The ongoing evaluation of our liquidity and capital resources is essential to ensure we can adequately finance our capital requirements, including potential business development activities. We anticipate that our cash requirements will be consistent with past levels relative to revenues, and we plan to invest significantly in new facilities to expand our manufacturing capabilities. Our strategic resource allocation decisions are influenced by the need to maintain operational flexibility and respond to external influences. The integration of technology capabilities into our business processes is vital for achieving performance gains and enhancing organizational effectiveness. We continuously assess our IT governance and capabilities to ensure alignment with our strategic objectives and to support our business innovation efforts. The management of our technology portfolio, including investments in digital transformation and data management, is critical for optimizing our operational processes and achieving competitive advantage in the marketplace.

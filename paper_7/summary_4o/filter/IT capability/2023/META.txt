In 2023, we initiated several measures to pursue greater efficiency and to realign our business and strategic priorities, which included significant investments in technology development across our efforts. Our investments include expenses relating to headcount, data centers, and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to develop our apps and our advertising services. We are making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI), including generative AI, to improve our delivery, targeting, and measurement capabilities. We are also focused on driving onsite conversions in our business messaging ad products by developing new features and scaling existing features. Our advertising revenue has been adversely affected by reduced marketer spending due to limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating systems and browsers. We are continually working to evolve our advertising systems to improve the performance of our ad products, which includes developing privacy-enhancing technologies to deliver relevant ads while reducing the amount of personal information we process. We believe our ongoing improvements to ad targeting and measurement are continuing to drive improved results for advertisers. Our ability to support our metaverse efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We are investing now because we believe this is the next chapter of the internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators. Our restructuring charges reflect our commitment to enhancing operational efficiency, which includes significant investments in technology infrastructure and data management. We recognize the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to transform our firm into a competitive force. Our operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure have increased, reflecting our commitment to maintaining and enhancing our IT capabilities. The increase in the number of ads delivered was driven by increases in the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products and an increase in users, which underscores the significance of our technology capabilities in driving business performance. We view daily active people (DAP) and monthly active users (MAU) as measures of engagement across our products, which are essential for understanding market dynamics and consumer choice. Our calculations of DAP and MAU rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products. The legislative and regulatory developments impacting our ability to use data signals in our ad products highlight the challenges we face in maintaining our competitive advantage. Our ongoing investments in technology are aimed at enhancing our operational flexibility and responsiveness to market changes, which are critical for sustaining our business performance. The integration of AI into our advertising tools and the development of new products are part of our strategy to align our technology capabilities with evolving business needs. We anticipate that future advertising revenue will be driven by a combination of price and the number of ads delivered, emphasizing the importance of our IT capabilities in navigating market opportunities.

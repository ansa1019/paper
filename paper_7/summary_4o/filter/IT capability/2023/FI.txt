We are a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology solutions, serving clients around the globe, including merchants, banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions. Our operations are comprised of the merchant acceptance segment, the financial technology segment, and the payments segment. The businesses in our acceptance segment provide a wide range of commerce-enabling solutions, including merchant acquiring and digital commerce services, mobile payment services, and security and fraud protection products. These solutions require modern technology capabilities to enable and optimize the acceptance of payments, reflecting the importance of IT capability in supporting business needs and enhancing operational efficiency. The fintech segment provides technology solutions that enable financial institutions to process customer deposit and loan accounts and manage their operations, highlighting the integration of IT capabilities with financial processes. The payments segment offers products and services required to process digital payment transactions, emphasizing the need for robust IT architecture and infrastructure to support these operations. We continue to allocate resources and assess performance based on our current reportable segment structure, which reflects our commitment to enhancing operational performance and delivering integrated solutions. The global payments landscape is evolving, with rapidly advancing technologies and a steady expansion of digital payments, necessitating a focus on modernizing technology and enhancing customer experience. Financial institutions are increasingly investing in solutions that help them win and retain customers, comply with regulations, and enhance operating efficiency, which underscores the strategic importance of IT capabilities in the competitive landscape. We believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients, providing new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce costs. Our focus on long-term client relationships and recurring, transaction-oriented products and services has reduced the impact of consolidation in the financial services industry. We actively monitor and manage our business in response to unpredictable geopolitical and market conditions, which may adversely impact our operations and financial results. The anticipated benefits of higher revenue from increased interest and inflation may be offset by foreign currency exchange losses. Our investments in acquisitions are aimed at enhancing our technology capabilities and expanding our service offerings, which are critical for meeting client demand and achieving operational efficiency. We have invested in integrating our platforms and value-added solutions to facilitate a seamless customer experience across mobile and online channels. The evolving regulatory and cybersecurity landscape continues to create challenges for financial institutions, driving interest in solutions that enhance operational efficiency and compliance. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on various factors, including market conditions and credit ratings, which are essential for funding future acquisitions and investments in technology.

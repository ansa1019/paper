During fiscal 2023, we invested approximately $3.2 billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditures, with investments focused on new stores and improving the customer experience, including through technology and development of other differentiated capabilities. Additionally, we invested approximately $1.5 billion on three acquisitions during fiscal 2023, accelerating our strategic initiatives and providing us with better capabilities to serve our customers. Our approach to capital allocation prioritizes investing in the business, followed by paying dividends, with the intent of then returning excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. We believe that our current cash position, cash flow generated from operations, funds available from our commercial paper program, and access to the long-term debt capital markets should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to invest in the business. Our liquidity and capital resources strategy includes a disciplined approach to resource allocation, which supports our operational flexibility and enhances our capability to respond to market dynamics. The decrease in comparable customer transactions reflects the impact of macroeconomic factors, including the continued shift in consumer consumption trends away from goods and towards services and the impact of a higher interest rate environment, pressuring home improvement demand. Online sales, which consist of sales generated online through our websites and mobile applications, represented 14.8% of net sales and increased by 1.1% during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, indicating an evolving IT capability in supporting digital technologies and enhancing customer relationships. We assess our sales performance by evaluating both net sales and comparable sales, which includes sales at all locations, physical and online, and reflects our internal processes and operational efficiency. Our gross profit margin was 33.4% in fiscal 2023, and the decrease in gross profit margin primarily reflects price stabilization as well as reduction and optimization of our inventory position. We continue to experience shrink above historical averages, which impacts our operational efficiency; however, we have managed to mitigate its effects through improved inventory management practices. The strategic management of our technology infrastructure and resources is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and supporting our business transformation efforts. We believe that our IT capabilities, including the ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources, are critical in enhancing our organizational effectiveness and achieving our long-term strategic goals. Our investments in technology and innovation partnerships are designed to improve our market responsiveness and agility, ensuring that we can adapt to changing consumer demands and external influences. The integration of technology into our business processes is a key driver of our performance improvement and operational excellence, enabling us to leverage our strategic resources effectively. As we continue to navigate the complexities of the business environment, our focus on enhancing our IT capabilities will remain a priority, ensuring that we can achieve sustainable growth and value creation for our stakeholders.

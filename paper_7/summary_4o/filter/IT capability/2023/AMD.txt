During 2023, we successfully launched multiple leadership products across our business and made important progress on our artificial intelligence (AI) strategy. We announced the availability of the AMD Instinct MI300x accelerators designed to deliver leadership performance for generative AI workloads and high-performance computing (HPC) applications. Our AI strategy focuses on delivering a broad portfolio and multigenerational roadmap of leadership CPUs, GPUs, and adaptive computing solutions for AI inference and training, extending the open software platform to enable our AI hardware to be deployed broadly and with ease. We strengthened our AI software capabilities with strategic acquisitions during the year, including Mipsology SAS and Nod, Inc., to develop the full AMD AI software stack and expand the open ecosystem of software tools, libraries, and models. Our AI engagements with a broad set of data center customers increased, with strong demand for our data center GPU products driven by large hyperscaler customers committed to deploying our next-generation AMD Instinct MI300 accelerators. The increase in data center segment revenue was primarily driven by higher sales of AMD Instinct GPUs and 4th Gen AMD EPYC CPUs. We continued to expand our embedded processor portfolio with powerful, scalable offerings for a variety of embedded applications. Our commercial portfolio was expanded with AMD Ryzen Pro 7000 series mobile processors to bring advanced and power-efficient x86 processors to business notebooks and mobile workstations. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by higher embedded segment revenue and lower amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Research and development expenses increased due to higher employee-related costs to support increased investment in AI. Our operational flexibility is reflected in our ability to adapt to changing market conditions, evidenced by our strategic resource allocation and investment in technology capabilities to enhance our competitive positioning. The integration of our AI strategy across multiple teams aims to drive the development of a comprehensive software ecosystem that spans our full product portfolio. We believe our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures and purchase commitments, over the next 12 months and beyond. Our contractual obligations and purchase commitments relate primarily to our obligations to purchase wafers and substrates from third parties and future payments related to certain software and technology licenses and IP licenses. The operational activities reflect our focus on cash collections from customers, payments for inventory purchases, and payments for employee-related expenditures, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining operational efficiency and resource management. The strategic decisions made in 2023, including the expansion of our technology portfolio and enhancements in our AI capabilities, are aimed at ensuring our firm remains a competitive force in the evolving technology landscape.

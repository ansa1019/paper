During the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed significant activities that underscore our operational capabilities, including the DCT transaction which involved the coordination of financial activities and strategic capital investments. Our business operations are evaluated based on the net operating income (NOI) of our segments, which reflects the integration of our real estate operations and strategic capital, thereby enhancing our operational efficiency and market responsiveness. The strong operating fundamentals in our markets have been supported by our ability to leverage technology resources and management skills to optimize our business processes. We have seen increased occupancy and positive rent rate growth, which are indicative of our effective resource deployment and strategic decision-making in response to market dynamics. Our development portfolio, which was 50.8% leased at year-end, illustrates our capability in managing and executing development projects that align with our organizational goals. The strategic capital segment, which includes revenues from asset and property management, demonstrates our ability to adapt to changing business needs and capitalize on investment opportunities. Our financial performance has been bolstered by the successful execution of our investment process, which includes the contribution of properties to unconsolidated co-investment ventures, thereby enhancing our operational flexibility and competitive positioning. The integration of our IT capabilities with our business strategies has become crucial in transforming our firm into a competitive force, enabling us to manage interfirm transactions effectively and maintain strong customer relationships. We recognize the importance of information management capability, which ensures that we provide accurate, timely, and reliable data to our stakeholders. Our governance practices support the mobilization and deployment of IT-based resources, which are essential for achieving our performance outcomes and maintaining compliance with regulatory contexts. The challenges posed by market volatility and external influences have necessitated a focus on innovation partnerships and strategic resource allocation to enhance our organizational effectiveness. The ongoing evaluation of our technology infrastructure and capabilities is vital for sustaining our competitive advantage and achieving performance excellence. As we navigate through environmental turbulence and dynamic changes in the market, our commitment to digital transformation and IT deployment will continue to drive our business innovation and operational efficiency.

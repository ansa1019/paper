We operate in an environment characterized by both complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services, and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S. and international customers at affordable prices. We continue to focus on affordability initiatives and expect to continue to innovate and invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers and invest in our people so that we have the technical skills necessary to succeed. We routinely conduct discussions, evaluate targets, and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, ventures, and equity investments. Our strategic plan includes growing our international sales, which involves strengthening our relationships internationally through partnerships and joint technology efforts. We have ongoing programs in production and sustainment activities that require effective IT capabilities to manage complex interfirm transactions and relationships. The F-35 program, for example, involves significant technological integration and coordination of resources to meet customer demands and enhance operational efficiency. Our business segments rely on advanced technology systems, products, and services, which necessitate a robust IT architecture to support business processes and enhance firm capabilities. We recognize the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to transform our firm into a competitive force. We have made substantial contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans, which are managed under U.S. government cost accounting standards, and we recover pension costs through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. government contracts. Our contracts are often complex and require a high level of coordination and integration of technology to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and to optimize performance outcomes. The management of our IT resources is critical to maintaining operational flexibility and responding to market dynamics effectively. We are committed to enhancing our IT capabilities to support our strategic objectives, including the development of innovative solutions that align with our business strategy and operational goals. The integration of advanced technologies into our operations is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and ensuring that we can meet the evolving needs of our customers in a rapidly changing environment. We continue to evaluate our technology portfolio to identify actionable investments that can drive performance gains and improve our overall business value. The ongoing transformation of our IT capabilities is a key focus area as we seek to enhance our organizational effectiveness and agility in responding to external influences and market demands.

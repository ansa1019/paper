During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we established a new leadership team and developed action plans to improve performance, enhance in-stocks, and drive a better customer experience, which reflects our focus on operational efficiency and business transformation. We are investing in top-selling items and rationalizing our store inventory to improve decision-making and execution, thereby aligning our portfolio with core business strategies. Our strategic reassessment included the exit of under-performing stores and non-core activities, which resulted in significant pre-tax charges, emphasizing the need for effective resource allocation and management capability. We are committed to delivering operational efficiency by simplifying store operations and improving in-stock execution, which is crucial for capitalizing on traffic to both stores and online platforms. Our focus on transforming our supply chain aims to enhance customer experience through advanced fulfillment and delivery capabilities, demonstrating our intent to leverage IT capabilities in support of business strategies. We are also working to improve digital experiences and productivity, which are essential for achieving merchandising excellence. The adoption of the revenue recognition accounting standard has positively impacted our financial performance, indicating the importance of aligning technology functionalities with business processes. Our capital expenditures reflect investments in strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing our ability to serve customers and improve performance. We are focused on building a sustainable foundation for long-term success, which includes enhancing our IT architecture and capabilities to support operational flexibility and market agility. The integration of digital technologies into our operations is intended to drive innovation and improve customer engagement, particularly with our pro customers. We recognize the significance of information management capability, which includes providing timely and reliable data to users, as we navigate changing business needs and directions. Our commitment to improving performance metrics and operational efficiency is evident in our strategic decisions and resource management practices. The evaluation of our business processes and the focus on customer value are critical to our overall organizational effectiveness and performance outcomes. We are also mindful of the external influences and market dynamics that affect our operations, which necessitate a robust IT governance framework to manage risks and enhance performance contributions. As we transition into 2019, we will continue to prioritize investments in technology resources and capabilities that align with our business strategy, ensuring that we remain competitive in the evolving market landscape.

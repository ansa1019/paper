Our strategies are designed to address key challenges facing our company, including a highly competitive operating environment and an evolving regulatory landscape.

The 2019 productivity plan will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market. Our risk management framework involves identifying, assessing, prioritizing, addressing, managing, monitoring, and communicating risks across the company's operations, including risks related to cybersecurity. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce capabilities, distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade, and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. Our corporate unallocated expenses include costs associated with ongoing business transformation initiatives, which are designed to enhance our operational capabilities and improve efficiency. We regularly evaluate productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plans and other initiatives discussed.

Our hedging strategies include the use of derivatives and, in the case of our net investment hedges, debt instruments. We have engaged in various research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth and to drive innovation globally. Our commitment to delivering sustained growth through empowered people acting with responsibility and building trust is reinforced by our global code of conduct.

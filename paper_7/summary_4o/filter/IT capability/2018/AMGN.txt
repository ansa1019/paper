Amgen's strategy includes a set of integrated activities intended to maintain and strengthen its competitive position in the biotechnology industry, which involves significant investments in research and development (R&D) activities. The company has committed to a more agile and efficient operating model through transformation and process improvement efforts, enabling resource reallocation to fund innovative pipeline and growth opportunities that deliver value to patients and stockholders. These efforts have resulted in approximately $1.9 billion of transformation and process improvement savings, which have been reinvested in product launches, clinical programs, and external business development. The company faces competition on its more mature products and has established productivity initiatives to enable investment in new products and defend existing products, thereby optimizing long- and short-term growth. Amgen's long-term success depends on its ability to discover, develop, and commercialize innovative products while acquiring or collaborating on therapies currently in development by other companies. The company has also continued to invest in external innovation to augment its internal innovation, focusing on genetic-related investments and genetically validated targets. The establishment of next-generation biomanufacturing capabilities is a critical component of Amgen's operational strategy, as these facilities are designed to manufacture products while maintaining a reliable, high-quality, compliant supply of medicines. The next-generation biomanufacturing plants require a smaller manufacturing footprint and offer greater environmental benefits, including reduced consumption of water and energy and lower levels of carbon emissions. The company's operational flexibility is enhanced by its ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. Amgen's IT capabilities are integral to supporting business needs and enhancing organizational goals, which are essential for maintaining competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving market. The company monitors the inventory levels of its products at wholesalers using data from wholesalers and other third parties, ensuring that historical fluctuations in inventory levels do not significantly affect its sales deductions and returns estimates. Additionally, the company recognizes the importance of information management capability, which includes providing data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access, tailored to changing business needs and directions. Amgen's commitment to innovation and process optimization is reflected in its ongoing investments in technology infrastructure and capabilities, which are critical for achieving operational efficiency and enhancing firm performance. The company's approach to strategic resource allocation and investment decisions is designed to support its long-term objectives and respond effectively to market dynamics and competitive actions.

AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people, and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address complex diseases. The company's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, advancing and investing in its pipeline, and ensuring sustainable growth. AbbVie intends to continue to advance its mission by diversifying revenue streams, driving late-stage pipeline assets to the market, and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches. The company anticipates several regulatory submissions and key data readouts from clinical trials, which are critical for achieving its strategic objectives. AbbVie expects to achieve these objectives through effective management of product sales growth and the favorable impact of pipeline products. The company remains committed to driving continued expansion of operating margins through revenue growth, productivity initiatives in supply chain, and ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing and commercial infrastructure. Research and innovation are cornerstones of AbbVie's business, with long-term success depending on the ability to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products. The pipeline includes over 60 compounds in clinical development, emphasizing the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging other resources and capabilities. The financial performance reflects continued funding to support all stages of AbbVie's emerging pipeline assets and investments in growth brands. The company monitors economic conditions and the creditworthiness of customers, establishing allowances against accounts receivable when necessary. AbbVie has a new $3.0 billion revolving credit facility that enables borrowing on an unsecured basis and contains various covenants. The company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt and attract long-term capital to support growth objectives. The effective tax rate reflects the impact of provisions related to earnings from foreign subsidiaries and the effects of intangible impairment expenses. AbbVie engages in R&D collaboration arrangements that may require future milestone payments contingent upon achieving specified development and regulatory milestones. The company regularly evaluates the collectability of its receivables and utilizes factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk. AbbVie’s ability to generate cash flows from operations and issue debt could be adversely affected by material declines in demand for its products or other unfavorable changes in business conditions. The company’s operational cash flows have improved due to revenue growth and decreased income tax payments. AbbVie’s long-term debt and capital lease obligations include significant liabilities related to contingent consideration from acquisitions, which are revalued at each reporting date based on various inputs. The company tests its goodwill for impairment annually, assessing qualitative factors and conducting quantitative impairment tests when necessary. Changes in the assumptions used in these tests could materially impact the company’s financial position and results of operations.

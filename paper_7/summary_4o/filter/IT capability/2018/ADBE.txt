During fiscal 2018, we reported strong financial results consistent with the continued execution of our long-term plans for our two strategic growth areas, digital media and digital experience, while continuing to market and license a broad portfolio of products and solutions. Our digital media segment, which includes our subscription-based offering Creative Cloud, provides desktop tools, mobile apps, and cloud-based services for designing, creating, and publishing content, emphasizing the integration of technology functionalities and operational efficiency. The digital experience segment offers comprehensive solutions that enable marketers to measure, personalize, and optimize marketing campaigns and digital experiences across channels, highlighting the importance of information management capability and technology deployment in achieving optimal marketing performance. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of our routes to market, reflecting our commitment to leveraging IT capabilities as a strategic resource in transforming our business into a competitive force. The integration of acquired platforms such as Marketo and Magento into our digital experience business illustrates our focus on enhancing our technology portfolio and operational flexibility. Our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to increase revenue with users, attract new customers, and grow our recurring revenue stream, which is essential for sustaining long-term growth in a competitive environment. The increase in subscription revenue across our offerings, driven by strong adoption of our Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud, underscores the value of our IT resources in supporting business needs and enhancing firm performance. We continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness and consideration of our subscription offerings, which are critical to maintaining market agility and responsiveness. Our digital experience solutions, including Adobe Advertising Cloud and Adobe Analytics Cloud, enable businesses to move from insights to actions in real time, integrating audiences as the core system of intelligence for the enterprise. The acquisition of companies like Marketo and Magento is expected to drive revenue growth in future years, as we leverage their capabilities to enhance our offerings and improve customer relationships. Our commitment to research and development is critical for remaining competitive in the marketplace, as we focus on the timely development of new and enhanced offerings that align with evolving consumer demands and market dynamics. The increase in annualized recurring revenue (ARR) and total digital media revenue reflects our successful execution of strategies aimed at enhancing our IT effectiveness and operational capabilities. We believe that our existing cash and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements, allowing us to continue investing in our technology infrastructure and capabilities. The strategic alignment of our business processes with our IT investments is essential for achieving performance excellence and ensuring that we can respond effectively to changes in the business environment.

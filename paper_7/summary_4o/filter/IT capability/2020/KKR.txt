The outbreak of COVID-19 continues to impact the United States and other countries throughout the world, causing disruptions to our business and adversely affecting our financial results. Economic and market conditions, including those caused by the pandemic, have a substantial impact on our financial condition and results of operations, affecting the values of the investments we make and our ability to raise capital from investors. Technological advancements and innovations may disrupt marketplaces and businesses, influencing our operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation. Our ability to attract new capital and investors is driven, in part, by the extent to which they view the alternative asset management industry and our investment products as attractive vehicles for capital appreciation or income. The competitive environment is characterized by greater competition, high valuations, and increased overall costs of credit, which may impact our ability to identify and execute attractive investments. Our investment strategy includes a focus on digital technologies and innovation partnerships, which are essential for maintaining competitive advantage and enhancing firm capabilities. We have expanded into strategies such as real assets, credit, and impact investing, which require effective management of technology resources and capabilities to support business needs. The management of our investment funds necessitates a comprehensive understanding of business processes and operational efficiency, which are critical for achieving performance gains and market-based performance. Our ability to realize investments and exit them profitably is influenced by the strength and liquidity of the U.S. and relevant global equity markets, which are affected by external influences including regulatory changes and geopolitical uncertainty. The valuation of our investments is significantly impacted by global financial markets, and the performance of our credit markets can amplify the effects on our financial results. Our operational effectiveness is supported by IT governance and the deployment of IT systems that facilitate communication and enhance relational capacity. The integration of technology infrastructure is vital for optimizing processes and improving organizational performance. As we navigate the complexities of the current business environment, our strategic decisions regarding resource management and investment choices are essential for maintaining agility and responsiveness to market dynamics. The evolving nature of our IT capabilities underscores the importance of mobilizing and leveraging IT-based resources in conjunction with other strategic resources to enhance our competitive positioning and drive value creation. Our investment process involves careful consideration of environmental factors and market restructuring, which necessitate a robust framework for information management and data analytics to support decision-making speed and accuracy. The ability to effectively manage our technology portfolio and ensure compliance with regulatory contexts is critical for sustaining our business transformation efforts and achieving long-term performance excellence.

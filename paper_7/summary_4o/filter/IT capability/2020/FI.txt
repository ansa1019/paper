We are a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology solutions, providing account processing and digital banking solutions, card issuer processing and network services, and e-commerce. Our operations include the acceptance segment, which offers a wide range of commerce-enabling solutions to merchants, and the fintech segment, which provides technology solutions to financial institutions. The fintech segment enables financial institutions to process customer deposit and loan accounts and manage general ledger and central information files, enhancing operational efficiency and supporting numerous types of financial transactions. The payments segment primarily provides products and services required to process digital payment transactions, including card transactions and non-card digital payment software and services. Our businesses are increasingly focused on modernizing technology, expanding data use, and enhancing customer experience to meet rising business and consumer expectations for convenience and security. Financial institutions are expected to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information, and offer innovative services in a rapidly evolving and competitive environment. We anticipate benefiting from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes. The integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for clients, providing new revenue sources and opportunities to reduce costs. The rapid growth in mobile and e-commerce has created opportunities for merchants to reach consumers, necessitating modern point-of-sale systems to streamline operations. Our acquisitions, including First Data, enhance our technology capabilities and expand our portfolio of services, enabling us to deliver frictionless, digital-first experiences to clients. We are focused on delivering integration value from acquisitions, building high-quality revenue, and enhancing client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. Our long-term priorities include delivering innovation and integration that enables differentiated value for clients. The evolving global regulatory and cybersecurity landscape presents challenges, driving interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers while complying with regulations. We continue to implement integration plans post-acquisition to achieve synergies, including enhanced revenue growth and operational efficiency. Our strategic acquisitions and investments in technology infrastructure are aimed at optimizing processes and enhancing organizational capabilities, ultimately contributing to improved performance outcomes and competitive positioning in the market. The COVID-19 pandemic has created uncertainty in economic conditions, impacting transaction volumes; however, we expect continued recovery and growth in payments volume and transactions as we adapt to changing market dynamics. Our focus on operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation positions us to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the evolving payments landscape.

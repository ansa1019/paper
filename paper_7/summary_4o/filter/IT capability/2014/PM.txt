The discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes. Our company manages its business in four segments, and we have a wide range of premium, mid-price, and low-price brands. Our portfolio comprises both international and local brands, and we refer to our operating revenues as net revenues, which are affected by various factors including product volume and pricing. The mix of products sold can impact our revenues, as can the geographic mix of shipment volumes. We incur costs related to marketing, administration, and research, which include expenses for developing new products. Our principal sources of funds are from dividends and debt repayments from subsidiaries, and our subsidiaries are not limited by long-term debt in their ability to pay cash dividends. The changes in our reported diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2014, reflect various factors including asset impairment and exit costs related to factory closures and restructuring efforts. Our effective income tax rate for 2014 was impacted by these costs as well as changes in tax law. We forecasted our 2015 full-year reported diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $4.27 to $4.37, which includes incremental spending for our reduced-risk product, IQOS, to support national expansion plans. This forecast does not include share repurchases and is subject to various risks.

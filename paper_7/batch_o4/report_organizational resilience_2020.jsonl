organizational resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” (vogus & sutcliffe, 2007: 3418). organizational resilience is defined as the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity. resilience can be defined as the system’s ability to maintain its integrity and its performance, at least partially, while under internal or external variations and disturbances (i.e. pressures, constraints, failures, errors, violations, hazards), whether nominal, extreme, or exceptional. defined as a company’s ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from a challenging situation. we develop a trajectory model of organizational resilience that focuses on how actors project temporal trajectories of responses toward disruptive events, reconstitute the trajectories in immediate response to the event, and reconfigure the trajectories toward the ensuing future. the concept of resilience draws attention to systems as well as individuals, to partial maintenance of integrity and performance, to the opposite of brittleness, and to disturbances that vary both in scale and source. resilience is a multifaceted concept that reflects businesses’ ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change to survive, grow, and flourish.\"\"\"\n\n    Text:\n    \"\"\"item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k. this section of this form 10-k generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this form 10-k can be found in \"management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\" in part ii, item 7 of the company's annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended september 28, 2019. fiscal year highlights covid-19 update covid-19 has spread rapidly throughout the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response. such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. the covid-19 pandemic has significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. the covid-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. during 2020, aspects of the company's business were adversely affected by the covid-19 pandemic, with many of the company's retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and the vast majority of the company's employees working remotely. the company has reopened some of its offices and the majority of its retail stores, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers, and it continues to work on safely re-opening the remainder of its offices and retail stores, subject to local rules and regulations. the full extent of the future impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the company's operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the company's control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products. refer to part i, item 1a of this form 10-k under the heading \"risk factors,\" for more information. the company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations. fiscal 2020 highlights total net sales increased 6% or $14.3 billion during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by higher net sales of services and wearables, home and accessories. the weakness in foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on net sales during 2020. in april 2020, the company announced an increase to its current share repurchase program authorization from $175 billion to $225 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.1925 to $0.205 per share beginning in may 2020. during 2020, the company repurchased $72.5 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $14.1 billion. on august 28, 2020, the company effected a four-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of august 24, 2020. all share, rsu and per share or per rsu information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. products and services performance the

margin increased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to higher products volume and material cost savings, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar and a different products mix. products gross margin percentage decreased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar and a different products mix, partially offset by material cost savings and higher leverage. services gross margin services gross margin increased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to higher services net sales and a different services mix. services gross margin percentage increased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to a different services mix and higher leverage, partially offset by higher services costs. the company's future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as set forth in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k under the heading \"risk factors.\" as a result, the company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and remain under downward pressure. operating expenses operating expenses for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2020 change 2019 change 2018 research and development $18,752 16 % $16,217 14 % $14,236 percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 5 % selling, general and administrative $19,916 9 % $18,245 9 %

growth in r&d expense in 2020 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. the company continues to believe that focused investments in r&d are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the company's core business strategy. selling, general and administrative the year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2020 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, higher spending on marketing and advertising, and higher variable selling expenses. other income/(expense), net other income/(expense), net (\"oi&e\") for 2020, 2019 and 2018 was as follows (dollars in millions): 2020 change 2019 change 2018 interest and dividend income $3,763 $4,961 $5,686 interest expense (2,873) (3,576) (3,240) other income/(expense), net (87) 422 (441) total other income/(expense), net $803 (56) % $1,807 (10) % $2,005 the year-over-year decrease in oi&e during 2020 was due primarily to lower interest income and net impairment/gain activity on non-marketable securities, partially offset by lower interest expense. the weighted-average interest rate earned by the company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.85% and 2.19% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. provision for income taxes provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2020 2019 2018 provision for income taxes $9,680 $10,481 $13,372 effective tax rate 14.4 % 15.9 % 18.3 % statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 24.5 % the company's effective tax rate for both 2020 and 2019 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact of tax settlements, and tax benefits from share-based compensation. the company's effective tax rate for 2020 was lower compared to 2019 due primarily to a one-time adjustment of u.s. foreign tax credits in response to regulations issued by the u.s. department of the treasury in december 2019 in connection with the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the \"act\") and higher tax benefits from share-based compensation. as of september 26, 2020, the company had net deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax credits of $11.0 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $2.8 billion. management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to recover the net deferred tax assets. the company will continue to evaluate the amount of the valuation allowance, if any, by assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets. recent accounting pronouncements financial instruments in june 2016, the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update no. 2016-13, financial instruments - credit losses (topic 326): measurement of credit losses on financial instruments (\"asu 2016-13\"), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses on certain financial instruments. the company will adopt asu 2016-13 in its first quarter of 2021 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. based on the composition of the company's investment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss activity, the adoption of asu 2016-13 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. liquidity and capital resources the following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the years ended september 26, 2020, september 28, 2019 and september 29, 2018 (in millions): 2020 2019 2018 cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities (1) $191,830 $205,898 $237,100 property, plant and

repurchases, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. in connection with the state aid decision, as of september 26, 2020, the adjusted recovery amount of €12.9 billion plus interest of €1.2 billion was funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings.

marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. the company's investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. during 2020, cash generated by operating activities of $80.7 billion was a

$66,044 $34,563 $36,797 $70,613 $208,017 (1)represents amount expected to be paid under manufacturing-related supplier arrangements, which are primarily noncancelable. leases the company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate, manufacturing and data center space. the company's retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. the above contractual obligations table includes future payments under leases that had commenced as of september 26, 2020, and were therefore recorded on the company's consolidated balance sheet, as well as leases that had been signed but not yet commenced as of september 26, 2020. further information regarding the company's leases can be found in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 12, \"leases.\" manufacturing purchase obligations the company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the company's products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. these outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. the company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. other purchase obligations the company's other purchase obligations consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and noncancelable obligations related to advertising, licensing, r&d, internet and telecommunications services, content creation and other activities. deemed repatriation tax payable as of september 26, 2020, a significant portion of the other non-current liabilities in the company's consolidated balance sheet consisted of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the act. the company plans to pay the deemed repatriation tax payable in installments in accordance with the act. other non-current liabilities the company's remaining other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing or amount of payments; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligations table. critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (\"gaap\") and the company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company's management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. note 1, \"summary of significant accounting policies,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material. management believes the company's critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimation of inventory purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. the company's senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company's board of directors. revenue recognition the company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iphone, mac, ipad and certain other products. the first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. the second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include icloud, siri and maps. the third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. the company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\"ssps\"). because the company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the company's estimated ssps. revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. the company's process for determining estimated ssps involves management's judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. should future facts and circumstances change, the company's ssps and the future rate of related amortization for product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights related to future sales of these devices could change. factors subject to change include the nature of the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights offered, their estimated value and the estimated period they are expected to be provided. valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimation of inventory purchase commitment cancellation fees the company invests in manufacturing-related assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers' facilities and prepayments provided to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term agreements to secure the supply of inventory. the company also accrues estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled. the company's estimates of future product development plans and demand for its products are key inputs in determining the recoverability of manufacturing-related assets and assessing the adequacy of any purchase commitment cancellation fee accruals. if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in estimated demand for one or more of the company's products, a change in the company's product development plans, or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company's products, the company may be required to record write-downs or impairments of manufacturing-related assets or accrue purchase commitment cancellation fees. warranty costs the company offers limited warranties on its new and certified refurbished hardware products and on parts used to repair its hardware products, and customers may purchase extended service coverage, where available, on many of the company's hardware products. the company accrues the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures outside the company's typical experience. if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required. income taxes the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater-than-50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on the company's financial condition and operating results. legal and other contingencies as discussed in part i, item 3 of this form 10-k under the heading \"legal proceedings\" and in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10, \"commitments and contingencies,\" the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. except as described in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10, \"commitments and contingencies\" under the heading \"contingencies,\" in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts above management's expectations, the company's financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\"\"\"\n\n    Instruction:\n    Identify and summarize all sentences or phrases that are directly or indirectly related to \"organizational resilience\", including but

organizational resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” (vogus & sutcliffe, 2007: 3418). organizational resilience is defined as the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity. resilience can be defined as the system’s ability to maintain its integrity and its performance, at least partially, while under internal or external variations and disturbances (i.e. pressures, constraints, failures, errors, violations, hazards), whether nominal, extreme, or exceptional. defined as a company’s ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from a challenging situation. we develop a trajectory model of organizational resilience that focuses on how actors project temporal trajectories of responses toward disruptive events, reconstitute the trajectories in immediate response to the event, and reconfigure the trajectories toward the ensuing future. the concept of resilience draws attention to systems as well as individuals, to partial maintenance of integrity and performance, to the opposite of brittleness, and to disturbances that vary both in scale and source. resilience is a multifaceted concept that reflects businesses’ ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change to survive, grow, and flourish.\"\"\"\n\n    Text:\n    \"\"\"item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial review abbott's revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of abbott's products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. abbott's primary products are medical devices, diagnostic testing products, nutritional products and branded generic pharmaceuticals. sales in international markets comprise approximately 62 percent of consolidated net sales. in 2020, the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic affected abbott's diversified health care businesses in various ways. as is further described below, some businesses have performed at the levels required to successfully meet new demands, others have faced challenges, and still others have been relatively less impacted by the pandemic. abbott's diagnostics business experienced the most significant change in sales from 2019 to 2020 as sales from new tests and other related products to detect covid-19 more than outweighed the negative impact of covid-19 on routine diagnostic testing volumes. abbott mobilized its teams across multiple fronts to develop and launch the following new diagnostic tests for covid-19 in 2020: ● in march, abbott launched a molecular test using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods on its m2000tm realtime lab-based platform to detect covid-19 pursuant to an emergency use authorization (eua) in the u.s. and ce mark. ● in march, abbott also launched a molecular test to detect covid-19 on its id nowtm rapid point-of-care platform in the u.s. pursuant to an eua. ● in april, abbott launched an igg (immunoglobulin g) lab-based serology blood test on its architect® i1000sr and i2000sr® laboratory instruments for the detection of an antibody to determine if someone was previously infected with the virus. the serology test was granted an eua in the u.s. and ce mark in april. ● in may, abbott launched a lab-based serology blood test on its alinity® i system pursuant to an eua in the u.s. and ce mark. ● in may, abbott also launched a molecular pcr test on its alinity m system to detect covid-19 pursuant to an eua in the u.s. abbott received ce mark for this test in june. ● in june, abbott launched a lateral flow covid-19 rapid antibody test on its panbiotm system in select countries pursuant to a ce mark. this serology test detects an antibody to determine if someone was previously infected with the virus. ● in august, abbott launched its advisedx sars-cov-2 igm (immunoglobulin m) lab-based serology test for use on its architect and alinity platforms pursuant to a ce mark. abbott was granted an eua in the u.s. for this test in october. ● in august, abbott launched its binaxnowtm covid-19 ag card test, a portable, lateral flow rapid test to detect covid-19 pursuant to an eua in the u.s. ● in september, abbott launched its panbio rapid antigen test to detect covid-19 pursuant to a ce mark. in october, abbott received approval by the world health organization for emergency use listing for the panbio antigen test. ● in december, abbott received ce mark and launched its sars-cov-2-igg ii quantitative lab-based serology blood test for use on its architect and alinity i platforms. ● in december, abbott received an eua in the u.s. for virtually guided at-home use of its binaxnow covid-19 ag card rapid test to detect covid-19 and launched the product for at-home use. ● in december, abbott launched its multiplex molecular test on its alinity m system to detect covid-19, flu a, flu b, and respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) pursuant to a ce mark. 21 in 2020, abbott's covid-19 testing related sales totaled approximately $3.884 billion, led by sales related to abbott's binaxnow, panbio and id now rapid testing platforms. in addition to negatively impacting routine core diagnostic testing volumes, the pandemic negatively affected the number of cardiovascular and neuromodulation procedures performed by health care providers globally, thereby reducing the demand for abbott's cardiovascular and neuromodulation devices and routine diagnostic tests in 2020. the decrease began in february in china as that country implemented quarantine restrictions and postponed non-emergency health care activities. the negative impact on cardiovascular and neuromodulation procedures and routine diagnostic tests expanded to other countries and geographic regions as covid-19 spread geographically in the first half of 2020 and health care systems in these countries shifted their focus to fighting covid-19. the extent of the impact and the timing of a recovery in the number of procedures and routine testing in a particular country or geographic region depended upon the progression of covid-19 cases in the country or region. the recovery in procedures and routine testing volumes in china began in march. in other parts of the world, such as the u.s. and europe, volumes improved across abbott's hospital-based businesses as the second quarter progressed and the improvement continued in the third quarter. however, in the fourth quarter, the improving trends in the demand for procedures and routine testing flattened or were negatively impacted depending upon the business and the region as many countries experienced an increase in the number of covid-19 cases and hospitalizations. abbott's branded generic pharmaceuticals business was also negatively affected by the pandemic in 2020 as covid-19 spread across emerging market countries in the second and third quarters of 2020. abbott's nutritional and diabetes care businesses were the least affected by the pandemic as is further discussed below. abbott is continually implementing business continuity plans in the face of the pandemic. due to the critical nature of its products and services, abbott was generally exempt from governmental orders issued during the first quarter of 2020 in the u.s. and other countries requiring businesses to cease operations. the majority of its office-based work was conducted remotely during the period of such governmental orders and the company implemented strict travel restrictions. as some governmental orders were lifted in may and june 2020, abbott entered a new phase in its operations whereby some office-based employees started working at abbott's offices on a rotational basis. as various governmental orders and guidelines were modified in the fourth quarter to put in place new restrictions, abbott continued to ensure that its guidance was aligned with such restrictions. abbott has taken aggressive steps to limit exposure and enhance the safety of facilities for its employees. due to the unpredictability of the duration and impact of the current covid-19 pandemic, the extent to which the covid-19 pandemic will have a material effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. while abbott's 2020 sales were most significantly affected by the covid-19 pandemic, the increase in total sales over the last three years also reflects volume growth due to the introduction of new products across various businesses as well as higher sales of various existing products. sales in emerging markets, which represent approximately 37 percent of total company sales, increased 2.0 percent in 2020 and 8.2 percent in 2019, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. (emerging markets include all countries except the united states, western europe, japan, canada, australia and new zealand.) over the last three years, abbott's operating margin as a percentage of sales increased from 11.9 percent in 2018 to 14.2 percent in 2019 and 15.5 percent in 2020. the increase in 2020 reflects the sales volume increases in the rapid and molecular diagnostics businesses, partially offset by lower medical devices sales due to the impact of the pandemic and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. in addition, a reduction in the costs associated with business acquisitions and restructuring activities drove an improvement in operating margins from 2018 to 2020. in 2019, the increase in abbott's operating margin also reflects margin improvement in various businesses and lower intangible amortization expense compared to 2018. with respect to the performance of each reportable segment over the last three years, sales in the medical devices segment excluding the impact of foreign exchange decreased 3.8 percent in 2020 and increased 10.5 percent in 2019. the sales decrease in 2020 was driven by abbott's cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses due primarily to reduced procedure volumes as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. these decreases were partially offset by double-digit growth in diabetes care. the sales increase in 2019 was driven primarily by higher diabetes care, structural heart, electrophysiology and heart failure sales. 22 in 2020, operating earnings for the medical devices segment decreased 19.4 percent. the operating margin profile decreased from 30.8 percent of sales in 2019 to 25.8 percent in 2020 primarily due to lower sales and manufacturing volumes as a result of the pandemic and pricing pressures on drug eluting stents (des) as a result of market competition in the u.s. and other major markets. in 2020, key product approvals in the medical devices segment included: ● ce mark for abbott's tendynetm transcatheter mitral valve implantation system for the treatment of significant mitral regurgitation (mr) in patients requiring a heart valve replacement who are not candidates for open-heart surgery or transcatheter mitral valve repair, ● ce mark for abbott's triclip® heart valve repair system, the world's first minimally invasive, clip-based device for repair of a leaky tricuspid heart valve, ● u.s. food and drug administration (fda) clearance of freestyle® libre 2 as an integrated continuous glucose monitoring (icgm) system for adults and children ages 4 and older with diabetes, ● ce mark for abbott's freestyle libre 3 system, which automatically delivers real time, up-to-the-minute glucose readings, 14-day accuracy and real-time glucose alarms, ● ce mark for the libre sensetm glucose sport biosensor that provides continuous glucose monitoring to help athletes better understand the efficacy of their nutrition choices on training and athletic performance, ● u.s. fda approval of the next-generation gallanttm implantable cardioverter defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator devices which help manage heart rhythm disorders and offer bluetooth technology and a new patient smartphone app for improved remote monitoring and enhanced patient-physician engagement, ● ce mark for mitraclip® g4, abbott's next-generation mitraclip mitral valve repair device, ● ce mark of ensitetm x ep system, a next-generation 3d cardiac mapping platform used for ablation therapy to treat abnormal heart rhythms, ● u.s. fda clearance and ce mark of the ionicrftm generator, a non-surgical, minimally invasive device that uses heat to target specific nerves for the management of chronic pain, and ● u.s. fda approval of updated labeling to allow abbott's heartmate 3tm heart pump to be used in pediatric patients with advanced refractory left ventricular heart failure. in abbott's worldwide diagnostics business, sales increased 40.6 percent in 2020 and 5.9 percent in 2019, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. as was discussed above, sales growth in 2020 was driven by demand for abbott's portfolio of covid-19 diagnostics tests across its rapid and lab-based platforms, partially offset by lower volumes of routine laboratory testing due to the pandemic. growth in 2019 reflected continued market penetration by the core laboratory business in the u.s. and internationally. the 2019 growth included the continued adoption by customers of alinity, which is abbott's integrated family of next-generation diagnostic systems and solutions that are designed to increase efficiency by running more tests in less space, generating test results faster and minimizing human errors while continuing to provide quality results. abbott has regulatory approvals in the u.s., europe, china, and other markets for the \"alinity c\" and \"alinity i\" instruments and has continued to build out its test menu for clinical chemistry and immunoassay diagnostics. abbott has obtained regulatory approval for the \"alinity h\" instrument for hematology in europe and japan. abbott has also obtained regulatory approvals in the u.s. and europe for the \"alinity s\" (blood screening) and \"alinity m\" (molecular) instruments and several testing assays. in 2020, operating earnings for the diagnostics segment increased 94.8 percent. the operating margin profile increased from 24.9 percent of sales in 2018 to 34.5 percent in 2020 primarily due to higher sales in 2020 in rapid diagnostics and molecular diagnostics, partially offset by lower volumes of routine testing in core laboratory. 23 in abbott's worldwide nutritional products business, sales over the last three years were positively impacted by numerous new product introductions, including the roll-outs of human milk oligosaccharide, or hmo, in infant formula and of high-protein ensure®, that leveraged abbott's strong brands. sales were also positively affected by demographics such as an aging population and an increasing rate of chronic disease in developed markets and the rise of a middle class in many emerging markets. excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total adult nutrition sales increased 10.3 percent in 2020 and 6.6 percent in 2019 led by the continued growth of ensure, abbott's market-leading complete and balanced nutrition brand, and glucerna®, abbott's market-leading diabetes-specific nutrition brand, across several countries. the 2019 sales growth was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the discontinuation of a non-core product line in the u.s. excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total pediatric nutrition sales increased 0.3 percent in 2020 and 3.4 percent in 2019 driven by the pediasure® and pedialyte® brands in the u.s. as well as infant and toddler product growth across several markets in asia and latin america, partially offset by challenging market dynamics in the infant category in greater china. the 2020 increase was also driven by higher similac® sales in the u.s. the established pharmaceutical products segment focuses on the sale of its products in emerging markets. excluding the impact of foreign exchange, established pharmaceutical sales increased 1.9 percent in 2020 and 7.3 percent in 2019. the sales increases in 2020 and 2019 reflect higher sales in several geographies including india, china, brazil and russia. operating margins decreased from 20.2 percent of sales in 2018 to 18.5 percent in 2020 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, product mix and lower gross margins. with respect to abbott's financial position, at december 31, 2020, abbott's cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments total approximately $7.1 billion compared to $4.1 billion at december 31, 2019. abbott's long-term debt and short-term borrowings total $18.7 billion and $18.1 billion at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. abbott declared dividends of $1.53 per share in 2020 compared to $1.32 per share in 2019, an increase of approximately 16 percent. dividends paid totaled $2.560 billion in 2020 compared to $2.270 billion in 2019. the year-over-year change in the amount of dividends paid primarily reflects the increase in the dividend rate. in december 2020, abbott increased the company's quarterly dividend by 25 percent to $0.45 per share from $0.36 per share, effective with the dividend paid in february 2021. in 2021, abbott will focus on continuing to meet the demand for covid-19 tests and will continue to invest in product development areas that provide the opportunity for strong sustainable growth over the next several years. in its diagnostics business, abbott will continue to focus on driving market adoption and geographic expansion of its alinity suite of diagnostics instruments. in the medical devices business, abbott will continue to focus on expanding its market position in various areas including diabetes care, structural heart, electrophysiology, and heart failure. in its nutritionals business, abbott will continue to focus on driving growth globally and further enhancing its portfolio with the introduction of line extensions of its science-based products. in the established pharmaceuticals business, abbott will continue to focus on growing its business with the depth and breadth of its portfolio in emerging markets. 24 critical accounting policies sales rebates - in 2020, approximately 41 percent of abbott's consolidated gross revenues were subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that abbott recorded as reductions of revenues at the time of sale. most of these rebates and allowances in 2020 are in the nutritional products and diabetes care businesses. abbott provides rebates to state agencies that administer the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children (wic), wholesalers, group purchasing organizations, and other government agencies and private entities. rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product. factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when abbott records its sale of the product. settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to six months after sale. abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018 amounted to approximately $3.3 billion, $3.1 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, or 20.1 percent, 19.1 percent and 19.0 percent of gross sales, respectively, based on gross sales of approximately $16.6 billion, $16.3 billion and $16.0 billion, respectively, subject to rebate. a one-percentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by approximately $166 million in 2020. abbott considers a one-percentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales. other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately $207 million, $169 million and $175 million for cash discounts in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $232 million, $192 million and $191 million for returns in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale, and therefore can be reliably estimated. returns can be reliably estimated because abbott's historical returns are low, and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter. in the domestic nutritional business, management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the accruals. in the wic business, estimates are required for the amount of wic sales within each state where abbott holds the wic contract. the state where the sale is made, which is the determining factor for the applicable rebated price, is reliably determinable. rebated prices are based on contractually obligated agreements generally lasting a period of two to four years. except for a change in contract price or a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the wic business in a state, accruals are based on historical redemption rates and data from the u.s. department of agriculture (usda) and the states submitting rebate claims. the usda, which administers the wic program, has been making its data available for many years. management also estimates the states' processing lag time based on sales and claims data. inventory in the retail distribution channel does not vary substantially. management has access to several large customers' inventory management data, which allows management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the retail distribution channel. at december 31, 2020, abbott had wic business in 27 states. historically, adjustments to prior years' rebate accruals have not been material to net income. abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it, and where possible, works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts. for government agency programs, the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations, which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation. income taxes - abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments. because abbott operates globally, the nature of the audit items is often very complex, and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country. abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible. in accordance with the accounting rules relating to the measurement of tax contingencies, in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit, the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position, and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit. application of these rules requires a significant amount of judgment. in the u.s., abbott's federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled. undistributed foreign earnings remain indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in its foreign entities is not practicable. 25 pension and post-employment benefits - abbott offers pension benefits and post-employment health care to many of its employees. abbott engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under these programs. abbott must develop long-term assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates, discount rates and the expected return on plan assets. the discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on high-quality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits. the health care cost trend rates represent abbott's expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and are a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date. a difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates, which will not be known for years, can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs. low interest rates have significantly increased actuarial losses for these plans. at december 31, 2020, pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and (credits) recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were net losses of $4.6 billion for abbott's defined benefit plans and net losses of $419 million for abbott's medical and dental plans. actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method, in accordance with the rules for accounting for post-employment benefits. differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a five-year period. valuation of intangible assets - abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that abbott records at fair value at the acquisition date. transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. abbott engages independent valuation experts who review abbott's critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles. abbott reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in impairment occurs. at december 31, 2020, goodwill amounted to $23.7 billion and net intangibles amounted to $14.8 billion. amortization expense in continuing operations for intangible assets amounted to $2.1 billion in 2020, $1.9 billion in 2019 and $2.2 billion in 2018. there was no reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in 2020, 2019 and 2018. litigation - abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with financial accounting standards board (fasb) accounting standards codification (asc) no. 450, \"contingencies.\" under asc no. 450, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known. accordingly, abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, and therefore the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. as information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately $90 million to $120 million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures. accruals of approximately $105 million have been recorded at december 31, 2020 for these proceedings and exposures. these accruals represent management's best estimate of probable loss, as defined by fasb asc no. 450, \"contingencies.\" 26 results

cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses was partially offset by double-digit volume growth in diabetes care. the increase in total net sales in 2019 reflects volume growth across all of abbott's segments. the price declines related to the medical devices segment in 2020 and 2019 primarily reflect des pricing pressures as a result of market competition in the u.s. and other major markets. 27 a

average foreign exchange rates and then those amounts are multiplied or divided, as appropriate, by the prior year average foreign exchange rates. total established pharmaceutical products sales increased 1.9 percent in 2020 and 7.3 percent in 2019, excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. the established pharmaceutical products segment is focused on several key emerging markets including india, russia, china and brazil. excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total sales in these key emerging markets increased 2.6 percent in 2020 and 7.9 percent in 2019 due to higher sales in several geographies including china, brazil, india and russia. excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales in established pharmaceuticals' other emerging markets decreased 0.5 percent in 2020 and increased 5.6 percent in 2019. total nutritional products sales increased 4.7 percent in 2020 and 4.8 percent in 2019, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. in 2020, international pediatric nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, decreased 4.1 percent as growth across abbott's pediatric products in various countries in southeast asia was more than offset by challenging market dynamics in the infant category in greater china. the 4.6 percent increase in 2019 international pediatric nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was driven by growth across abbott's portfolio, including similac and pediasure in various countries in asia and latin america and pedialyte in latin america. this growth was partially offset by challenging market dynamics in the infant category in greater china. in the u.s. pediatric nutritional business, sales increased 5.8 percent in 2020 and 1.9 percent in 2019, reflecting growth in similac in 2020 and growth in pediasure and pedialyte in both years. 29 in the international adult nutritional business, sales increased 13.6 percent and 10.9 percent in 2020 and 2019, respectively, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to continued growth of ensure and glucerna in several countries. in 2020 u.s. adult nutritional sales increased 4.9 percent, primarily due to growth of ensure. in 2019, u.s. adult nutritional sales were unchanged from 2018 due to the impact of abbott's discontinuation of a non-core product line during the third quarter of 2018 that was offset by growth in other areas of the business. in the diagnostics segment, core laboratory sales decreased 2.8 percent in 2020, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, as the lower volume of routine testing performed in hospital and other laboratories due to covid-19 was partially offset by sales of abbott's covid-19 laboratory-based tests for the detection of the igg and igm antibodies, which determine if someone was previously infected with the virus. core laboratory antibody testing-related sales on abbott's architect and alinity i platforms were $268 million in 2020. the 225.7 percent increase in molecular diagnostics sales in 2020, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects higher volumes due to demand for abbott's laboratory-based molecular tests for covid-19 on its m2000 and alinity m platforms. abbott received u.s. fda approval in march 2020 for its alinity m molecular diagnostics system. molecular diagnostics covid-19 testing-related sales were $1.023 billion in 2020. in rapid diagnostics, sales increased 112.3 percent in 2020, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to strong demand for abbott's point-of-care covid-19 molecular test on its id now platform and its binaxnow covid-19 ag card test in the u.s. as well as international demand for covid-19 rapid tests on its panbio system and increased testing in the first quarter for the flu in the u.s. these increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of covid-19 on routine diagnostic testing. rapid diagnostics covid-19 testing-related sales were $2.593 billion in 2020. in the diagnostics segment, the sales increase in 2019 was driven by above-market growth in core laboratory in the u.s. and internationally, where abbott achieved continued adoption of its alinity family of diagnostic instruments. the 6.3 percent decrease in 2019 molecular sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects the negative impact of lower non-governmental organization purchases in africa. in rapid diagnostics, sales growth in 2019 in various areas, including infectious disease testing in developed markets and cardio-metabolic testing, was mostly offset by lower than expected infectious disease testing sales in africa. excluding the effect of foreign exchange, total medical devices sales decreased 3.8 percent and increased 10.5 percent in 2020 and 2019, respectively. in 2020, double-digit growth in diabetes care was more than offset by decreases in abbott's cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses due to the impact of covid-19 and lower vascular sales in china in the fourth quarter of 2020 as a result of a new national tender program. the 2019 sales increase was driven by double-digit growth in diabetes care, structural heart, electrophysiology and heart failure. the 2020 and 2019 growth in diabetes care revenue was driven by continued growth of freestyle libre, abbott's continuous glucose monitoring system, internationally and in the u.s. in 2020, freestyle libre sales totaled $2.635 billion, which reflected a 42.6 percent increase over 2019, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. freestyle libre sales in 2019 were $1.842 billion, which reflected a 69.8 percent increase, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, over 2018 when sales totaled $1.128 billion. in 2019, growth in structural heart revenue was broad-based across several areas of the business, including mitraclip, abbott's market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation (mr), a leaky heart valve. 2019 growth in electrophysiology revenue reflects higher sales of cardiac diagnostic and ablation catheters in both the u.s. and internationally. the growth in heart failure revenue in 2019 was driven by rapid market adoption in the u.s. of abbott's heartmate 3® left ventricular assist device (lvad) following fda approval in october 2018 as a destination (long-term use) therapy for people living with advanced heart failure as well as higher sales of abbott's cardiomems® heart failure monitoring system. in vascular, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, sales in 2019 were flat as the 1.3 percent increase in coronary and endovascular product sales, which includes drug-eluting stents, balloon catheters, guidewires, vascular imaging/diagnostics products, vessel closure, carotid and other coronary and peripheral products, was offset by reductions in royalty and contract manufacturing revenue. in rhythm management, higher 2019 international sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, were offset by a 4.4 percent decrease in u.s. revenue. in 2019, the 2.4 percent decline in neuromodulation sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects a 4.2 percent decline in u.s. sales. abbott has periodically sold product rights to non-strategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with abbott's revenue recognition policies as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. related net sales were not significant in 2020, 2019 and 2018. 30 the expiration of licenses and patent protection can affect the future revenues and operating income of abbott. there are no significant patent or license expirations in the next three years that are expected to materially affect abbott. in april 2017, abbott received a warning letter from the u.s. fda related to its manufacturing facility in sylmar, ca which was acquired by abbott on january 4, 2017 as part of the acquisition of st. jude medical, inc. (st. jude medical). this facility manufactures implantable cardioverter defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators, and monitors. abbott prepared and executed a comprehensive plan of corrective actions. on april 28, 2020, abbott received a letter from the fda indicating that, based on the fda's evaluation, it appeared that abbott had addressed the items in the warning letter. as a result, the warning letter is considered closed. operating earnings gross profit margins were 50.5 percent of net sales in 2020, 52.5 percent in 2019 and 51.3 percent in 2018. in 2020, the decrease primarily reflects the mix of sales across abbott's various businesses and operational inefficiencies due to the impact of covid-19, as well as the increase in intangible asset amortization, the impairment of intangible assets and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange on gross margin in 2020. in 2019, the increase primarily reflects lower intangible amortization expense and lower integration and restructuring costs. research and development (r&d) expenses were $2.4 billion in 2020 and 2019, and $2.3 billion in 2018. r&d spending in 2020 was relatively flat compared to 2019 as the impact of the immediate expensing in 2019 of an r&d asset valued at $102 million that was acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of cephea valve technologies, inc. (cephea) was partially offset by the $55 million impairment of an in-process r&d intangible asset in 2020. r&d expense in 2020 also reflects lower integration and restructuring costs in 2020 related to r&d, partially offset by higher spending on various projects. r&d expenses in 2019 increased 6.1 percent, primarily reflecting the immediate expensing of the cephea r&d asset as well as higher r&d spending in various businesses, primarily in medical devices, partially offset by the favorable effect of foreign exchange. in 2020, r&d expenditures totaled $1.3 billion for the medical devices segment, $608 million for the diagnostic products segment, $189 million for the nutritional products segment and $177 million for the established pharmaceutical products segment. selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses were basically flat in 2020 and 2019 versus the respective prior years. in 2020, the favorable effect of foreign exchange, income of approximately $100 million from a litigation settlement in 2020, lower spending due to covid-19 travel restrictions, and the impact of various cost saving initiatives were offset by higher spending to drive growth in various businesses. in 2019, the favorable effect of foreign exchange and lower acquisition-related integration costs offset higher selling and marketing costs to drive continued growth across various businesses. restructurings from 2017 to 2020, abbott management approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisitions of st. jude medical into the medical devices segment, and alere inc. (alere) into the diagnostic products segment, in order to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs. as of december 31, 2017, the accrued balance associated with these actions was $68 million. from 2018 to 2020, abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges totaling approximately $137 million, comprised of $13 million in 2020, $72 million in 2019 and $52 million in 2018. approximately $30 million was recorded in cost of products sold, approximately $15 million was recorded in research and development, and approximately $92 million was recorded in selling, general and administrative expense over the last three years. as of december 31, 2020, the accrued liabilities remaining in the consolidated balance sheet related to these actions total $25 million and primarily represent severance obligations. from 2016 to 2020, abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in various abbott businesses including the nutritional, established pharmaceuticals and vascular businesses. abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of approximately $36 million in 2020, $66 million in 2019 and $28 million in 2018. approximately $6 million in 2020, $16 million in 2019 and $10 million in 2018 are recorded in cost of products sold, approximately $2 million in 2020, $28 million in 2019 and $2 million in 2018 are recorded in research and development, and approximately $28 million in 2020, $22 million in 2019 and $16 million in 2018 are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. 31 interest expense and interest (income) interest expense, net decreased $76 million in 2020 due to a reduction in interest expense resulting from the favorable impact of the euro debt financing in november 2019, the repayment of debt in december 2019 and a lower interest rate environment in 2020. in 2019, interest expense, net decreased $145 million due to the favorable impact of the euro debt financing in september 2018, as well as the repayment of debt in 2018 and the first quarter of 2019. debt extinguishment costs on december 19, 2019, abbott redeemed the $2.850 billion principal amount of its 2.9% notes due 2021. abbott incurred a charge of $63 million related to the early repayment of this debt. on october 28, 2018, abbott redeemed approximately $4 billion of debt, which included $750 million principal amount of its 2.00% notes due 2020; $597 million principal amount of its 4.125% notes due 2020; $900 million principal amount of its 3.25% notes due 2023; $450 million principal amount of its 3.4% notes due 2023; and $1.300 billion principal amount of its 3.75% notes due 2026. abbott incurred a net charge of $153 million related to the early repayment of this debt and the unwinding of related interest rate swaps. on march 22, 2018, abbott redeemed all of the $947 million principal amount of its 5.125% notes due 2019, as well as $1.055 billion of the $2.850 billion principal amount of its 2.35% notes due 2019. abbott incurred a net charge of $14 million related to the early repayment of this debt. other (income) expense, net other (income) expense, net, for 2020, 2019 and 2018 includes approximately $205 million, $225 million, and $160 million of income in each year, respectively, related to the non-service cost components of the net periodic benefit costs associated with the pension and post-retirement medical plans. other (income) expense, net for 2020 also includes equity investment impairments that totaled approximately $115 million. taxes on earnings the income tax rates on earnings from continuing operations were 10.0 percent in 2020, 9.6 percent in 2019 and 18.8 percent in 2018. in 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include the recognition of approximately $170 million of tax benefits associated with the impairment of certain assets, approximately $140 million of net tax benefits as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years, and approximately $100 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. in 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations also include a $26 million increase to the transition tax associated with the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act (tcja). the $26 million increase to the transition tax liability was the result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. this adjustment increased the cumulative net tax expense related to the tcja to $1.53 billion. in 2019, taxes on earnings from continuing operations included approximately $100 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation, an $86 million reduction of the transition tax and $68 million of tax expense resulting from tax legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2019 in india. the $86 million reduction to the transition tax liability was the result of the issuance of final transition tax regulations by the u.s. department of treasury in 2019. in 2018, taxes on earnings from continuing operations included $98 million of net tax expense related to the settlement of abbott's 2014-2016 federal income tax audit in the u.s., partial settlement of the former st. jude medical consolidated group's 2014 and 2015 federal income tax returns in the u.s. and audit settlements in various countries as well as approximately $90 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. in 2018, abbott also recorded $130 million of additional tax expense related to the tcja; the $130 million reflected a $120 million increase in the transition tax from $2.89 billion to $3.01 billion and a $10 million reduction in the net benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. 32 exclusive of these discrete items, tax expense was favorably impacted by lower tax rates and tax exemptions on foreign income primarily derived from operations in puerto rico, switzerland, ireland, the netherlands, costa rica, singapore, and malta. abbott benefits from a combination of favorable statutory tax rules, tax rulings, grants, and exemptions in these tax jurisdictions. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for a full reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the u.s. federal statutory rate. discontinued operations the net earnings of discontinued operations include income tax benefits of $24 million in 2020 and $39 million in 2018. the 2020 tax benefits primarily relate to the resolution of various tax positions related to abbott's developed markets branded generic pharmaceuticals business which was sold to mylan inc. (mylan) in 2015. the tax positions relate to years prior to the sale to mylan. the 2018 tax benefits primarily relate to the resolution of various tax positions related to the operations of abbvie inc. (abbvie) for years prior to the separation. abbott completed the separation of abbvie, which was formed to hold abbott's research-based proprietary pharmaceuticals business, in january 2013. abbott retained all liabilities for all u.s. federal and foreign income taxes on income prior to the separation. research and development programs abbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical, medical devices, diagnostic and nutritional products in development. research and development process in the established pharmaceuticals segment, the development process focuses on the geographic expansion and continuous improvement of the segment's existing products to provide benefits to patients and customers. as established pharmaceuticals does not actively pursue primary research, development usually begins with work on existing products or after the acquisition of an advanced stage licensing opportunity. depending upon the product, the phases of development may include: ● drug product development. ● phase i bioequivalence studies to compare a future established pharmaceutical's brand with an already marketed compound with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient (api). ● phase ii studies to test the efficacy of benefits in a small group of patients. ● phase iii studies to broaden the testing to a wider population that reflects the actual medical use. ● phase iv and other post-marketing studies to obtain new clinical use data on existing products within approved indications. the specific requirements (e.g., scope of clinical trials) for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions. the process may range from one year for a bioequivalence study project to 6 or more years for complex formulations, new indications, or geographic expansion in specific countries, such as china. in the diagnostics segment, the phases of the research and development process include: ● discovery which focuses on identification of a product that will address a specific therapeutic area, platform, or unmet clinical need. ● concept/feasibility during which the materials and manufacturing processes are evaluated, testing may include product characterization and analysis is performed to confirm clinical utility. ● development during which extensive testing is performed to demonstrate that the product meets specified design requirements and that the design specifications conform to user needs and intended uses. 33 the regulatory requirements for diagnostic products vary across different countries and geographic regions. in the u.s., the fda classifies diagnostic products into classes (i, ii, or iii) and the classification determines the regulatory process for approval. while the diagnostics segment has products in all three classes, the vast majority of its products are categorized as class i or class ii. submission of a separate regulatory filing is not required for class i products. class ii devices typically require pre-market notification to the fda through a regulatory filing known as a 510(k) submission. most class iii products are subject to the fda's premarket approval (pma) requirements. other class iii products, such as those used to screen blood, require the submission and approval of a biological license application (bla). in the european union (eu), diagnostic products are also categorized into different categories and the regulatory process, which has been governed by the european in vitro diagnostic medical device directive, depends upon the category, with certain product categories requiring review and approval by an independent company, known as a notified body, before the manufacturer can affix a ce mark to the product to declare conformity to the directive. other products only require a self-certification process. in the second quarter of 2017, the eu adopted the new in vitro diagnostic regulation (ivdr) which replaces the existing directive in the eu for in vitro diagnostic products. the ivdr will apply after a five-year transition period and imposes additional premarket and postmarket regulatory requirements on manufacturers of such products. in the medical devices segment, the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability. if the research program passes that hurdle, it moves forward into development. the development process includes evaluation, selection and qualification of a product design, completion of applicable clinical trials to test the product's safety and efficacy, and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet pre-determined specifications. similar to the diagnostic products discussed above, in the u.s., medical devices are classified as class i, ii, or iii. most of abbott's medical device products are classified as class ii devices that follow the 510(k) regulatory process or class iii devices that are subject to the pma process. in the eu, medical devices are also categorized into different classes and the regulatory process, which has been governed by the european medical device directive and the active implantable medical device directive, varies by class. each product must bear a ce mark to show compliance with the directive. in the second quarter of 2017, the eu adopted the new medical devices regulation (mdr) which replaces the existing directives in the eu for medical devices and imposes additional premarket and postmarket regulatory requirements on manufacturers of such products. while the mdr was previously adopted to apply after a three year transition period, in 2020 the european parliament postponed the date of application by one year. some products require submission of a design dossier to the appropriate regulatory authority for review and approval prior to ce marking of the device. for other products, the company is required to prepare a technical file which includes testing results and clinical evaluations but can self-certify its ability to apply the ce mark to the product. outside the u.s. and the eu, the regulatory requirements vary across different countries and regions. after approval and commercial launch of some medical devices, post-market trials may be conducted either due to a conditional requirement of the regulatory market approval or with the objective of proving product superiority. in the nutritional segment, the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations (e.g., infants and adults) or patients (e.g., people with diabetes). depending upon the country and/or region, if claims regarding a product's efficacy will be made, clinical studies typically must be conducted. in the u.s., the fda requires that it be notified of proposed new formulations and formulation or packaging changes related to infant formula products. prior to the launch of an infant formula or product packaging change, the company is required to obtain the fda's confirmation that it has no objections to the proposed product or packaging. for other nutritional products, notification or pre-approval from the fda is not required unless the product includes a new food additive. in some countries, regulatory approval may be required for certain nutritional products, including infant formula and medical nutritional products. 34 areas of focus in 2021 and beyond, abbott's significant areas of therapeutic focus will include the following: established pharmaceuticals - abbott focuses on building country-specific portfolios made up of high-quality medicines that meet the needs of people in emerging markets. over the next several years, abbott plans to expand its product portfolio in key therapeutic areas with the aim of being among the first to launch new off-patent and differentiated medicines. in addition, abbott continues to expand existing brands into new markets, implement product enhancements that provide value to patients and acquire strategic products and technology through licensing activities. abbott is also actively working on the further development of several key brands such as creontm, duphastontm, duphalactm and influvactm. depending on the product, the activities focus on development of new data, markets, formulations, delivery systems, or indications. one example includes the launch of abbott's quadrivalent influenza vaccination influvac® tetra in 12 markets and an expanded indication in 16 markets to cover children, adolescents and young adults from 3 to 17 years old. medical devices - abbott's research and development programs focus on: ● cardiac rhythm management - development of next-generation rhythm management technologies, including advanced communication capabilities and leadless pacing therapies. ● heart failure - continued enhancements to abbott's mechanical circulatory support and pulmonary artery pressure systems, including enhanced clinical performance and usability. ● electrophysiology - development of next-generation technologies in the areas of ablation, diagnostic, mapping, and visualization and recording. ● vascular - development of next-generation technologies for use in coronary and peripheral vascular procedures. ● structural heart - development of minimally-invasive transcatheter and surgical devices for the repair and replacement of heart valves and other structural heart conditions. ● neuromodulation - development of additional clinical evidence and next-generation technologies leveraging digital health to improve patient and physician engagement to treat chronic pain, movement disorders and other indications. ● diabetes care - develop enhancements and additional indications for the freestyle libre platform of continuous glucose monitoring products to help patients improve their ability to manage diabetes and for use beyond diabetes. nutritionals - abbott is focusing its research and development spend on platforms that span the pediatric and adult nutrition areas: gastro intestinal/immunity health, brain health, mobility and metabolism, and user experience platforms. numerous new products that build on advances in these platforms are currently under development, including clinical outcome testing, and are expected to be launched over the coming years. core laboratory diagnostics - abbott continues to commercialize its next-generation blood screening, immunoassay, clinical chemistry and hematology systems, along with assays, including a focus on unmet medical need, in various areas including infectious disease, cardiac care, metabolics, and oncology, as well as informatics solutions to help optimize diagnostics laboratory performance and automation solutions to increase efficiency in laboratories. molecular diagnostics - several new molecular in vitro diagnostic (ivd) tests are in various stages of development and launch. rapid diagnostics - abbott's research and development programs focus on the development of diagnostic products for infectious disease, cardiometabolic disease and toxicology. in addition, the diagnostics divisions are pursuing the fda's customary regulatory process for various covid-19 tests for which an eua was obtained in 2020. 35 given the diversity of abbott's business, its intention to remain a broad-based health care company and the numerous sources for potential future growth, no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years. factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to abbott's total research and development expenses, as well as qualitative factors, such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on abbott's overall market position. there were no delays in abbott's 2020 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations. while the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material, the total cost to complete will depend upon abbott's ability to successfully finish each project, the rate at which each project advances, and the ultimate timing for completion. given the potential for significant delays and the risk of failure inherent in the development of medical device, diagnostic and pharmaceutical products and technologies, it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development. abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spending that will be competitive in each of the businesses in which it participates, and such spending is expected to approximate 7.0 percent of total abbott sales in 2021. abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period. goodwill at december 31, 2020, goodwill recorded as a result of business combinations totaled $23.7 billion. goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in the third quarter or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs, using a quantitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. the income and market approaches are used to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit. the results of the last impairment test indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value. financial condition cash flow net cash from operating activities amounted to $7.9 billion, $6.1 billion and $6.3 billion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the increase in net cash from operating activities in 2020 was primarily due to the favorable cash flow impact of higher segment operating earnings, lower payments related to interest, integration expenses, and restructuring actions, and the proceeds from a litigation settlement partially offset by an increased investment in working capital and higher income tax payments. the decrease in net cash from operating activities in 2019 was primarily due to an increased investment in working capital, timing of pension contributions relative to 2018 and higher income tax payments, partially offset by the favorable cash flow impact of improved segment operating earnings and lower interest and acquisition-related expenses. while a significant portion of abbott's cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2020, are reinvested in foreign subsidiaries, abbott does not expect such reinvestment to affect its liquidity and capital resources. due to the enactment of the tcja, if these funds were needed for operations in the u.s., abbott does not expect to incur significant additional income taxes in the future to repatriate these funds. abbott funded $400 million in 2020, $382 million in 2019 and $114 million in 2018 to defined benefit pension plans. abbott expects pension funding of approximately $410 million in 2021 for its pension plans. abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed abbott's capital expenditures and cash dividends. debt and capital at december 31, 2020, abbott's long-term debt rating was a by standard & poor's corporation and a3 by moody's. abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating. 36 abbott has readily available financial resources, including unused lines of credit that support commercial paper borrowing arrangements and provide abbott with the ability to borrow up to $5 billion on an unsecured basis. the lines of credit are part of a five year credit agreement (revolving credit agreement) that abbott entered into on november 12, 2020. at that time, abbott also terminated its 2018 revolving credit agreement. there were no outstanding borrowings under the 2018 revolving credit agreement at the time of its termination. any borrowings under the revolving credit agreement will mature and be payable on november 12, 2025. any borrowings under the revolving credit agreement will bear interest, at abbott's option, based on either a base rate or eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin based on abbott's credit ratings. in 2020, financing activities related to the issuance and repayment of long-term debt included the following: ● on june 24, 2020, abbott completed the issuance of $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $650 million of its 1.15% notes due 2028 and $650 million of its 1.40% notes due 2030. ● on september 28, 2020, abbott repaid the €1.140 billion outstanding principal amount of its 0.00% notes due 2020 upon maturity. the repayment equated to approximately $1.3 billion. as of december 31, 2020, abbott's total debt is $18.7 billion. in 2018 and 2019, abbott committed to reducing its debt levels which had increased as part of the acquisitions of st. jude medical and alere in 2017. in 2018, net repayments totaled approximately $8.3 billion of debt. on february 24, 2019, abbott redeemed the $500 million outstanding principal amount of its 2.80% notes due 2020. in september 2019, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. this bond redemption authorization superseded the board's previous authorization under which $700 million had not yet been redeemed. on december 19, 2019, abbott redeemed the $2.850 billion outstanding principal amount of its 2.90% notes due 2021. $2.15 billion of the 2019 $5 billion redemption authorization remains available as of december 31, 2020. on november 19, 2019, abbott's wholly owned subsidiary, abbott ireland financing dac, completed a euro debt offering of €1.180 billion of long-term debt. the proceeds equated to approximately $1.3 billion. the notes are guaranteed by abbott. on november 21, 2019, abbott borrowed ¥59.8 billion under a 5-year term loan and designated the yen-denominated loan as a hedge of its net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. the term loan bears interest at tibor plus a fixed spread, and the interest rate is reset quarterly. the proceeds equated to approximately $550 million. in total, these 2019 transactions resulted in the repayment of approximately of $1.6 billion of debt, net of borrowings. in september 2014, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of abbott's common shares from time to time. under the program authorized in 2014, abbott repurchased 36.2 million shares at a cost of $1.666 billion in 2015, 10.4 million shares at a cost of $408 million in 2016, 1.9 million shares at a cost of $130 million in 2018, 6.3 million shares at a cost of $525 million in 2019, and 1.6 million shares at a cost of $173 million in 2020 for a total of approximately $2.9 billion. in october 2019, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3 billion of abbott's common shares from time to time. the 2019 authorization is in addition to the approximately $100 million unused portion of the share repurchase program authorized in 2014. on april 27, 2016, the board of directors authorized the issuance and sale for general corporate purposes of up to 75 million common shares that would result in proceeds of up to $3 billion. no shares have been issued under this authorization. abbott declared dividends of $1.53 per share in 2020 compared to $1.32 per share in 2019, an increase of approximately 16 percent. dividends paid were $2.560 billion in 2020 compared to $2.270 billion in 2019. the year-over-year change in dividends paid primarily reflects the impact of the increase in the dividend rate. 37 working capital working capital was $8.5 billion at december 31, 2020 and $4.8 billion at december 31, 2019. the increase was due in large part to the higher level of cash and cash equivalents, which was due primarily to the increase in cash generated from operating activities, and the repayment of the current portion of long term debt after the issuance of new long term notes in 2020. working capital also increased due to the higher levels of accounts receivable and inventory partially offset by an increase in accounts payable associated with the growth of the business. abbott monitors the credit worthiness of customers and establishes an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances. capital expenditures capital expenditures of $2.2 billion in 2020, $1.6 billion in 2019 and $1.4 billion in 2018 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing and research and development facilities and equipment in various segments, investments in information technology, and laboratory instruments placed with customers. the 2020 increase in capital expenditures primarily reflects the building of capacity for the manufacture of covid-19 diagnostics tests. contractual obligations the table below summarizes abbott's estimated contractual obligations as of december 31, 2020. payments due by period 2026 and (in millions) total 2021 2022‐2023 2024‐2025 thereafter long‐term debt, including current maturities $18,490 $7 $3,203 $2,802 $12,478 interest on debt obligations

(b) other long-term liabilities include estimated payments for the transition tax under the tcja, net of applicable credits. (c) net unrecognized tax benefits totaling approximately $740 million are excluded from the table above as abbott is unable to reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities on such items. see note 15 - taxes on earnings from continuing operations for further details. the company has employee benefit obligations consisting of pensions and other post-employment benefits, including medical and life, which have been excluded from the table. a discussion of the company's pension and post-retirement plans, including funding matters is included in note 14 - post-employment benefits. 38 contingent obligations abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events. legislative issues abbott's primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world. abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. a more complete discussion of these factors is contained in item 1, business, and item 1a, risk factors. recently issued accounting standards in december 2019, the fasb issued accounting standards update (asu) 2019-12, income taxes (topic 740): simplifying the accounting for income taxes, which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod tax allocations and the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. the standard becomes effective for abbott in the first quarter of 2021. adoption of this new standard will not have a material impact on abbott's consolidated financial statements. in february 2018, the fasb issued asu 2018-02, reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income, which allows companies to reclassify stranded tax effects resulting from the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act, from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to retained earnings (earnings employed in the business). abbott adopted the new standard at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2018. as a result of the adoption of the new standard, approximately $337 million of stranded tax effects were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings employed in the business. in october 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-16, income taxes (topic 740): intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory, which requires the recognition of the income tax effects of intercompany sales and transfers of assets, other than inventory, in the period in which the transfer occurs. abbott adopted the standard on january 1, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach and recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment to earnings employed in the business in the consolidated balance sheet that was not significant. in june 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-13, financial instruments - credit losses, which changes the methodology to be used to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. the new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. abbott adopted the standard on january 1, 2020 and recorded a cumulative adjustment that was not significant to earnings employed in the business in the consolidated balance sheet. private securities litigation reform act of 1995 - a caution concerning forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, abbott cautions investors that any forward-looking statements or projections made by abbott, including those made in this document, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect abbott's operations are discussed in item 1a, risk factors. 39\"\"\"\n\n    Instruction:\n    Identify and summarize all sentences or phrases that are directly or indirectly related to \"organizational resilience\", including but not limited to: scholars have defined organizational resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” (vogus & sutcliffe, 2007: 3418).

organizational resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” (vogus & sutcliffe, 2007: 3418). organizational resilience is defined as the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity. resilience can be defined as the system’s ability to maintain its integrity and its performance, at least partially, while under internal or external variations and disturbances (i.e. pressures, constraints, failures, errors, violations, hazards), whether nominal, extreme, or exceptional. defined as a company’s ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from a challenging situation. we develop a trajectory model of organizational resilience that focuses on how actors project temporal trajectories of responses toward disruptive events, reconstitute the trajectories in immediate response to the event, and reconfigure the trajectories toward the ensuing future. the concept of resilience draws attention to systems as well as individuals, to partial maintenance of integrity and performance, to the opposite of brittleness, and to disturbances that vary both in scale and source. resilience is a multifaceted concept that reflects businesses’ ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change to survive, grow, and flourish.\"\"\"\n\n    Text:\n    \"\"\"item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in

the quarters of our fiscal year. we use the term \"in local currency\" so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. financial results \"in local currency\" are calculated by restating current period activity into u.s. dollars using the comparable prior-year period's foreign currency exchange rates. this approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the u.s. dollar. change in reportable segments effective march 1, 2020, we began managing our business under a new growth model through our three geographic markets, north america, europe and growth markets, which became our reportable segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. prior to this change, our reportable segments were our five industry groups, communications, media & technology, financial services, health & public service, products and resources. for additional information, see our form 8-k filed on january 13, 2020. overview the covid-19 pandemic has caused a significant loss of life, disrupted businesses and restricted travel worldwide, causing significant economic disruption and uncertainty. this disruption and uncertainty has had and continues to have a significant adverse impact on our business, operations and financial results. for fiscal 2020, our revenues grew 3% in u.s. dollars and 4% in local currency, a decrease compared to the revenue growth experienced in fiscal 2019. revenues for the first half of fiscal 2020 grew 7% in u.s. dollars and 8% in local currency compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. on march 11, 2020, the world health organization declared covid-19 a pandemic, and during the second half of fiscal 2020, our revenues declined 1% in u.s. dollars and were flat in local currency compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. the pandemic impacted almost all aspects of our business and forced us to quickly adapt the way we operate. as described below, we took actions to shift the majority of our workforce to a remote working environment to ensure the continuity of our business, including the sales and delivery of services to our clients, and to respond to a rapidly changing demand environment from our clients. as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, we enabled approximately 95% of our global workforce to work from home and suspended substantially all business travel. we continue to develop and implement our comprehensive plan to return to our and our clients' offices where permissible, with our people's safety and the needs of our clients guiding how we manage our phased transition. we experienced reduced demand for our services during the second half of fiscal 2020 as some clients reprioritized and delayed certain work as a result of the pandemic, particularly in the travel, retail, energy, high tech and industrial industries and primarily for our consulting services. we also experienced increased demand in the public service, software & platforms and life sciences industries and from clients across all of our industry groups in connection with their digital transformations, the adoption of cloud technologies and security-related services. in this current market, the level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading

significantly adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the covid-19 pandemic.\" under item 1a, \"risk factors.\" summary of results revenues for fiscal 2020 increased 3% in u.s. dollars and 4% in local currency compared to fiscal 2019. this included the impact of a decline in reimbursable travel costs, which reduced revenues approximately 1%. during fiscal 2020, revenue growth in local currency was strong in growth markets, solid in north america and flat in europe. we experienced local currency revenue growth that was very strong in health & public service, modest in products, communications, media & technology and financial services and flat in resources. revenue growth in local currency was strong in outsourcing and modest in consulting during fiscal 2020. the business environment remained competitive, and the changes in demand have led to increased pricing pressure, particularly for our consulting services. we use the term \"pricing\" to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell. in our consulting business, revenues for fiscal 2020 were flat in u.s. dollars and increased 2% in local currency compared to fiscal 2019. this included the impact of a decline in reimbursable travel costs, which reduced consulting revenues approximately 2%. consulting revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2020 was led by strong growth in growth markets and modest growth in north america, partially offset by a modest decline in europe. our consulting revenue continues to be driven by digital-, cloud- and security-related services and assisting clients with the adoption of new technologies. in addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses. in our outsourcing business, revenues for fiscal 2020 increased 6% in u.s. dollars and 7% in local currency compared to fiscal 2019. outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2020 was led by strong growth across all geographic markets. we continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with the operation and maintenance of digital-related services and cloud enablement. in addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and cost efficiency. as we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. the majority of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, including the euro, japanese yen, and u.k. pound. there continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results. if the u.s. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in u.s. dollars may be higher. if the u.s. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in u.s. dollars may be lower. the u.s. dollar strengthened against various currencies during fiscal 2020, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and u.s. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 1% lower than our revenue growth in local currency for the year. assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges, we estimate that our fiscal 2021 revenue growth in u.s. dollars will be approximately 2% higher than our revenue growth in local currency. the primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services, sales and marketing and general and administrative costs. cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. general and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs. utilization for fiscal 2020 was 90%, down from 91% in fiscal 2019. we hire to meet current and projected future demand. we proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, increased to approximately 506,000 as of august 31, 2020, compared to approximately 492,000 as of august 31, 2019. the year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions. attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for fiscal 2020 was 12%, down from 17% in fiscal 2019. we evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. in addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. for the majority of our personnel, compensation increases become effective december 1st of each fiscal year. we strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our margin. our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees. accenture 2020 form 10-k item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations gross margin (revenues less cost of services as a percentage of revenues) for fiscal 2020 was 31.5%, compared with 30.8% for fiscal 2019. the increase in gross margin for fiscal 2020 was due to lower non-payroll costs, primarily for travel, partially offset by an increase in labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to fiscal 2019. sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.8% for fiscal 2020, compared with 16.2% for fiscal 2019. for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues increased 10 basis points and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily due to higher technology and facilities costs. operating margin (operating income as a percentage of revenues) for fiscal 2020 was 14.7%, compared with 14.6% for fiscal 2019. during fiscal 2020, we recorded gains of $332 million and $52 million in tax expense related to our investment in duck creek technologies. for additional information, see note 1 (summary of significant accounting policies) to our consolidated financial statements under item 8, \"financial statements and supplementary data.\" the effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was 23.5%, compared with 22.5% for fiscal 2019. absent the $332 million gains on an investment and related $52 million in tax expense, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 would have been 23.9%. diluted earnings per share were $7.89 for fiscal 2020, compared with $7.36 for fiscal 2019. the $280 million gains on an investment, net of taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.43 in fiscal 2020. excluding the impact of these gains, diluted earnings per share would have been $7.46 for fiscal 2020. we have presented our effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding the impact of gains related to an investment in fiscal 2020, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to the impact of this item and our performance in comparison to the prior period. our operating income and diluted earnings per share are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues and costs. most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related revenues. where practical, we seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related revenues, such as the costs associated with our global delivery model, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs. for more information on our hedging programs, see note 9 (financial instruments) to our consolidated financial statements under item 8, \"financial statements and supplementary data.\" bookings new bookings for fiscal 2020 were $49.6 billion, with consulting bookings of $25.8 billion and outsourcing bookings of $23.7 billion, compared to $45.5 billion in fiscal 2019, with consulting bookings of $24.7 billion and outsourcing bookings of $20.8 billion. we provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through acquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts. the types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues. for example, outsourcing bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings. information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. new bookings involve estimates and judgments. there are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. we do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. new bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. the majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in the performance obligations disclosed in note 2 (revenues) to our consolidated financial statements under item 8, \"financial statements and supplementary data.\" accordingly, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations. accenture 2020 form 10-k item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. we continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience. because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. these include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes. revenue recognition determining the method and amount of revenue to recognize requires us to make judgments and estimates. specifically, complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether promised goods and services specified in an arrangement are distinct performance obligations and should be accounted for separately. other judgments include determining whether performance obligations are satisfied over-time or at a point-in-time and the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion. we measure progress towards completion for technology integration consulting services using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. revenues, including estimated fees, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. the amount of revenue recognized for these contracts in a period is dependent on our ability to estimate total contract costs. we continually evaluate our estimates of total contract costs based on available information and experience. additionally, the nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including incentive fees. many contracts include incentives or penalties related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. we conduct reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable. our estimates are monitored over the lives of our contracts and are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance, historical experience and other information available at the time. for additional information, see note 2 (revenues) to our consolidated financial statements under item 8, \"financial statements and supplementary data.\" income taxes on december 22, 2017, the u.s. enacted the tax cuts and jobs act (the \"tax act\"), which significantly changed u.s. tax law. the tax act lowered the u.s. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective january 1, 2018, resulting in a blended u.s. statutory federal income tax rate of 25.7% for our fiscal year ended august 31, 2018 and a u.s. statutory federal income tax rate of 21.0% for our fiscal year ended august 31, 2019. the tax act's \"base erosion and anti-abuse tax\" provision, and regulations issued thereunder, adversely impact our effective tax rate by limiting our ability to deduct certain expenses. determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. as a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly. factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate. we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs. in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs. we release stranded tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive loss using the specific identification approach for our defined benefit plans and the portfolio approach for other items. accenture 2020 form 10-k item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. if future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate. we currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute these indefinitely reinvested earnings. for additional information, see note 11 (income taxes) to our consolidated financial statements under item 8, \"financial statements and supplementary data.\" as a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. we establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. in evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. we evaluate tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax positions are reasonable. however, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for these positions. revenues by segment/geographic market effective march 1, 2020, we began managing our business under a new growth model through our three geographic markets, north america, europe and growth markets, which became our reportable segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. prior to this change, our reportable segments were our five industry groups, communications, media & technology, financial services, health & public service, products and resources. see note 7 (goodwill and intangible assets) and note 16 (segment reporting) to our consolidated financial statements under item 8, \"financial statements and supplementary data\" for further details regarding the change in our reportable segments. in addition to reporting revenues by geographic markets, we also report revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our geographic markets. consulting revenues, which include strategy, management and technology consulting and technology integration consulting, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. outsourcing revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions. from time to time, our geographic markets work together to sell and implement certain contracts. the resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating geographic markets. generally, operating expenses for each geographic market have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. however, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our geographic markets affect revenues and operating expenses within our geographic markets to differing degrees. the mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our geographic markets. local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our geographic markets differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses. while we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and the outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors. accenture 2020 form 10-k item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 effective march 1, 2020, we began managing our business under a new growth model through our three geographic markets, north america, europe and growth markets, which became our reportable segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. prior to this change, our reportable segments were our five operating

impacted by a reduction of approximately 1% from a decline in revenues from reimbursable travel costs in fiscal 2020 across all markets. the following revenues commentary discusses local currency revenue changes for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019: geographic markets •north america revenues increased 5% in local currency, led by growth in public service, life sciences, software & platforms, health and banking & capital markets. these increases were partially offset by declines in chemicals & natural resources and high tech. revenue growth was driven by the united states. •europe revenues were flat in local currency, led by growth in life sciences, software & platforms, chemicals & natural resources and health. these increases were partially offset by declines in banking & capital markets, consumer goods, retail & travel services and high tech. revenues were led by growth in italy and germany, partially offset by declines in the united kingdom, spain and france. •growth markets revenues increased 8% in local currency, led by growth in software & platforms, banking & capital markets, public service, chemicals & natural resources, industrial and life sciences. revenue growth was driven by japan, as well as brazil. operating expenses operating expenses for fiscal 2020 increased $903 million, or 2%, over fiscal 2019, and decreased as a percentage of

fiscal 2019. the increase in gross margin for fiscal 2020 was primarily due to lower non-payroll costs, primarily for travel, partially offset by an increase in labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to fiscal 2019. sales and marketing sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2020 increased $178 million, or 4%, over fiscal 2019, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 10.4% from 10.3% during this period. general and administrative costs general and administrative costs for fiscal 2020 increased $274 million, or 11%, over fiscal 2019, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 6.4% from 5.9% during this period. the increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to higher technology and facilities costs compared to fiscal 2019. operating income and operating margin operating income for fiscal 2020 increased $209 million, or 3%, over fiscal 2019. effective march 1, 2020, we began managing our business under a new growth model through our three geographic markets, north america, europe and growth markets, which became our reportable segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. prior to this change, our reportable segments were our five industry groups, communications, media & technology, financial services, health & public service, products and resources. operating income and operating margin for each of the geographic markets are as follows: fiscal

exchange rates on our operating income during fiscal 2020 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market. the reduction in travel costs during fiscal 2020 had a favorable impact on operating income. the commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income for fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019: •north america operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower outsourcing contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues. •europe operating income decreased due to lower consulting contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues. •growth markets operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability. accenture 2020 form 10-k item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other income (expense), net other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. during fiscal 2020, other income (expense) increased $342 million over fiscal 2019, primarily due to gains of $332 million related to our investment in duck creek technologies. for additional information, see note 1 (summary of significant accounting policies) to our consolidated financial statements under item 8, \"financial statements and supplementary data.\" income tax expense the effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was 23.5%, compared with 22.5% for fiscal 2019. absent the $332 million gains on an investment and related $52 million in tax expense, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 would have been 23.9%. the higher effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was primarily due to lower benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes and the phased-in effects of u.s. tax reform, partially offset by higher tax benefits from share-based payments. for additional information, see note 11 (income taxes) to our consolidated financial statements under item 8, \"financial statements and supplementary data.\" net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some current and former members of accenture leadership and their permitted transferees have in our accenture canada holdings inc. subsidiary. see \"business-organizational structure.\" noncontrolling interests also includes amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our avanade inc. subsidiary. net income attributable to accenture plc represents the income

analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity available under various credit facilities. we could raise additional funds through other public or private debt or equity financings. we may use our available or additional funds to, among other things: •facilitate purchases, redemptions and exchanges of shares and pay dividends; •acquire complementary businesses or technologies; •take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion; or •develop new services and solutions. as of august 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents were $8.4 billion, compared with $6.1 billion as of august 31, 2019. cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our consolidated cash flows statements, are summarized in the following table: fiscal change (in millions of u.s. dollars) 2020 2019 net cash provided by (used in): operating activities $8,215 $6,627 $1,588 investing activities (1,895) (1,756) (139) financing activities (4,049) (3,767) (282) effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 17 (39) 56 net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $2,288 $1,065 $1,223 operating activities: the $1,588 million increase in operating cash flows was due to higher net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities, including higher collections on net client balances (receivables from clients, contract assets and deferred revenues). investing activities: the $139 million increase in cash used was due to higher spending on business acquisitions, partially offset by increased proceeds from investments. for additional information, see note 6 (business combinations) to our consolidated financial statements under item 8, \"financial statements and supplementary data.\" financing activities: the $282 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of shares as well as an increase in cash dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from share issuances. for additional information, see note 14 (shareholders' equity) to our consolidated financial statements under item 8, \"financial statements and supplementary data.\" we believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. in addition, domestic cash inflows for our irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. borrowing facilities see note 10 (borrowings and indebtedness) to our consolidated financial statements under item 8, \"financial statements and supplementary data.\" share purchases and redemptions we intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during fiscal 2021. the number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of accenture canada holdings inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by accenture 2020 form 10-k item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other means. the repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or

organizational resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” (vogus & sutcliffe, 2007: 3418). organizational resilience is defined as the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity. resilience can be defined as the system’s ability to maintain its integrity and its performance, at least partially, while under internal or external variations and disturbances (i.e. pressures, constraints, failures, errors, violations, hazards), whether nominal, extreme, or exceptional. defined as a company’s ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from a challenging situation. we develop a trajectory model of organizational resilience that focuses on how actors project temporal trajectories of responses toward disruptive events, reconstitute the trajectories in immediate response to the event, and reconfigure the trajectories toward the ensuing future. the concept of resilience draws attention to systems as well as individuals, to partial maintenance of integrity and performance, to the opposite of brittleness, and to disturbances that vary both in scale and source. resilience is a multifaceted concept that reflects businesses’ ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change to survive, grow, and flourish.\"\"\"\n\n    Text:\n    \"\"\"item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 is included in item 7 of our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended november 29, 2019, filed with the sec on january 21, 2020. acquisitions subsequent to november 27, 2020, we completed our acquisition of workfront, a privately held company that provides a work management platform for marketers, for approximately $1.5 billion in cash consideration. workfront will be integrated into our digital experience reportable segment for financial reporting purposes in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. during fiscal 2019, we acquired the remaining interest in allegorithmic sas (\"allegorithmic\"), a privately held 3d editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, for approximately $106 million in cash consideration, and integrated it into our digital media reportable segment. during fiscal 2018, we completed our acquisitions of marketo, a privately held marketing cloud platform company, for approximately $4.73 billion and magento, a privately held commerce platform company, for approximately $1.64 billion, and integrated them into our digital experience reportable segment. we also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. see note 3 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these acquisitions, including pro forma financial information related to the marketo acquisition. pro forma information has not been presented for our other acquisitions during the fiscal years presented as the impact to our consolidated financial statements was not material. critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the sec, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. we base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates on a regular basis. we also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors. we believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business combinations and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. these areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, and consequently, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results. revenue recognition our contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. for example, some of our offerings include both on-premise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services. determining whether the software licenses and the cloud services are distinct from each other, and therefore performance obligations to be accounted for separately, or not distinct from each other, and therefore part of a single performance obligation, may require significant judgment. we have concluded that the on-premise/on-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our creative cloud and document cloud subscription offerings are not distinct from each other such that revenue from each offering should be recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud services are provided. in reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our promise to creative cloud and document cloud customers, which is to provide a complete end-to-end creative design or document workflow solution that operates seamlessly across multiple devices and teams. we fulfill this promise by providing access to a solution that integrates cloud-based and on-premise/on-device features that, together through their integration, provide functionalities, utility and workflow efficiencies that could not be obtained from either the on-premise/on-device software or cloud services on their own. cloud-based features that are integral to our creative cloud and document cloud offerings and that work together with the on-premise/on-device software include, but are not limited to: creative cloud libraries, which enable customers to access their work, settings, preferences and other assets seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices and collaborate across teams in real time; shared reviews which enable simultaneous editing and commenting of pdfs across desktop, mobile and web; automatic cloud rendering of a design which enables it to be worked on in multiple mediums; and sensei, adobe's cloud-hosted artificial intelligence and machine learning framework, which enables features such as automated photo-editing, photograph content-awareness, natural language processing, optical character recognition and automated document tagging. business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations. although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to: •future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents; •historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers; •the acquired company's trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company's product portfolio; •the expected use of the acquired assets; and •discount rates. in connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed. the estimated fair value of these obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. the cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. in addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities. our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. in addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the u.s. internal revenue service and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. these tax examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices, application of tax rules, and other matters. we regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from such examinations. we believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, we cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have a significant impact on the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. during fiscal 2020, we completed intra-entity transfers of certain intellectual property rights (\"ip rights\") which resulted in the establishment of deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits of $224 million and $1.13 billion, based on the fair value of the ip rights transferred in april and november 2020, respectively. the determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. the sustainability of our future tax benefits is dependent upon the acceptance of the valuation estimates and assumptions by the taxing authorities. recent accounting pronouncements see note 1 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements that are of significance, or potential significance to us. results of operations overview of 2020 for our fiscal 2020, we experienced strong demand across our digital media offerings consistent with the continued execution of our long-term plans with respect to this segment. in our digital experience segment, we continued to experience growth in software-based subscription revenue across our portfolio of offerings. during the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we began to discontinue our transaction-driven advertising cloud offerings, allowing us to focus our investment on strategic growth initiatives. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we moved our advertising cloud offerings from our digital experience segment into our new publishing and advertising segment, which combined advertising cloud with our previous publishing segment. this realignment is consistent with how we manage our digital experience segment to better reflect the strategic shift related to advertising cloud and to align with our overall core value proposition of delivering on customer experience management. digital media in our digital media segment, we are a market leader with creative cloud, our subscription-based offering which provides desktop tools, mobile apps and cloud-based services for designing, creating and publishing rich and immersive content. creative cloud delivers value with deep, cross-product integration, frequent product updates and feature enhancements, cloud-enabled services including storage and syncing of files across users' machines, machine learning and artificial intelligence, access to marketplace, social and community-based features with our adobe stock and behance services, app creation capabilities, tools which assist with enterprise deployments and team collaboration, and affordable pricing for cost-sensitive customers. we offer creative cloud for individuals, students, teams and enterprises. we expect creative cloud will drive sustained long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by acquiring new users as a result of low cost of entry and delivery of additional features and value to creative cloud, as well as keeping existing customers current on our latest release. we have also built out a marketplace for creative cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our adobe stock service. overall, our strategy with creative cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and grow our recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably. we continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our creative cloud offerings. these strategies include increasing the value creative cloud users receive, such as offering new desktop and mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to try out and ultimately subscribe to creative cloud. because of the shift towards creative cloud subscriptions and enterprise term license agreements (\"etlas\"), revenue from perpetual licensing of our creative products has been immaterial to our business. we are also a market leader with our document cloud offerings built around our adobe acrobat family of products, including adobe acrobat reader dc, and a set of integrated mobile apps and cloud-based document services, including adobe scan and adobe sign. acrobat provides reliable creation and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source type. document cloud, which we believe enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes adobe acrobat dc and adobe sign, and a set of integrated services enabling users to create, review, approve, sign and track documents whether on a desktop or mobile device. adobe acrobat dc is offered both through subscription and perpetual licenses. annualized recurring revenue (\"arr\") is currently the key performance metric our management uses to assess the health and trajectory of our overall digital media segment. arr should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue, unbilled backlog and remaining performance obligation as arr is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. we adjust our reported arr on an annual basis to reflect any material exchange rates changes. our reported arr results in the current fiscal year are based on currency rates set at the beginning of the year and held constant throughout the year. we calculate arr as follows: creative arr annual value of creative cloud subscriptions and services annual creative etla contract value document cloud arr annual value of document cloud subscriptions and services annual document cloud etla contract value digital media arr creative arr document cloud arr creative arr exiting fiscal 2020 was $8.72 billion, up from $7.25 billion at the end of fiscal 2019. document cloud arr exiting fiscal 2020 was $1.46 billion, up from $1.08 billion at the end of fiscal 2019. total digital media arr grew to $10.18 billion at the end of fiscal 2020, up from $8.33 billion at the end of fiscal 2019. revaluing our ending arr for fiscal 2020 using currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2021, our digital media arr at the end of fiscal 2020 would be $10.26 billion or approximately $77 million higher than the arr reported above. our success in driving growth in arr has positively affected our revenue growth. creative revenue in fiscal 2020 was $7.74 billion, up from $6.48 billion in fiscal 2019 and representing 19% year-over-year growth. document cloud revenue in fiscal 2020 was $1.50 billion, up from $1.22 billion in fiscal 2019 and representing 22% year-over-year revenue growth and reflecting an increase in demand driven by the shift to remote work as well as our continued efforts to transition document cloud to a subscription-based model. total digital media segment revenue grew to $9.23 billion in fiscal 2020, up from $7.71 billion in fiscal 2019 and representing 20% year-over-year growth. these increases were driven by strong net new user growth, including those resulting from the current work-from-home environment reflecting expanded digital engagement. digital experience we are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our digital experience segment. the adobe experience cloud applications, services and platform are designed to manage customer journeys, enable shoppable experiences and deliver intelligence for businesses of any size in any industry. our differentiation and competitive advantage is strengthened by our ability to use the adobe experience platform to connect our comprehensive set of solutions. adobe experience cloud is focused on delivering solutions for our enterprise customers across the following strategic growth pillars: •customer data and insights. our solutions deliver real-time customer profiles and intelligence across the customer journey. our offerings include adobe experience platform, adobe analytics, adobe audience manager, customer journey analytics, real-time customer data platform and intelligent services. •content and commerce. our solutions to help customers manage, deliver, test, target and optimize content delivery and enable shopping experiences that scale from mid-market to enterprise businesses. our offerings include adobe experience manager, adobe target and adobe commerce. •customer journey management. our solutions help businesses manage, personalize and orchestrate campaigns and customer journeys across b2e use cases. our offerings include adobe campaign, marketo engage and journey orchestration. in addition to chief marketing officers, chief revenue officers and digital marketers, users of our digital experience solutions include advertisers, campaign managers, publishers, data analysts, content managers, social marketers, marketing executives and information management and technology executives. these customers often are involved in workflows that utilize other adobe products, such as our digital media offerings. by combining the creativity of our digital media business with the science of our digital experience business, we help our customers to more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop. we utilize a direct sales force to market and license our digital experience solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem of partners, including marketing agencies, systems integrators and independent software vendors that help license and deploy our solutions to their customers. we have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments. digital experience revenue for all fiscal years presented has been updated to reflect the advertising cloud segment move. digital experience revenue was $3.13 billion in fiscal 2020, up from $2.80 billion in fiscal 2019 which represents 12% year-over-year growth. driving this increase was the increase in subscription revenue across our offerings which grew to $2.66 billion in fiscal 2020 from $2.28 billion in fiscal 2019, representing 17% year-over-year growth. covid-19 update in march 2020, the world health organization declared the outbreak of a disease caused by a novel strain of the coronavirus (covid-19) to be a pandemic. this pandemic has had widespread, rapidly-evolving and unpredictable impacts on global societies, economies, financial markets and business practices. federal and state governments have implemented measures in an effort to contain the virus, including physical distancing, travel restrictions, border closures, limitations on public gatherings, work from home, supply chain logistical changes and closure of non-essential businesses. our focus remains on promoting employee health and safety, serving our customers and ensuring business continuity. as a result, we have taken action to direct our teams to work from home, suspend travel and replace in-person events such as adobe summit and max, with digital events through july 2021. during the pandemic, digital has become the primary way for people to connect, work, learn and be entertained, and for businesses to engage with customers. this macro trend towards all things digital has increased the importance and relevance of our solutions and accelerated the tailwinds that benefit our business, which contributed to our continued growth year over year. however, while our revenue and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model, the broader implications of the pandemic on our results of operations and overall financial performance remain uncertain. see risk factors for further discussion of the possible impact of the pandemic on our business. financial performance summary for fiscal 2020 •total digital media arr of approximately $10.18 billion as of november 27, 2020 increased by $1.85 billion, or 22%, from $8.33 billion as of november 29, 2019. the increase in our digital media arr was primarily due to new user adoption of our creative cloud and document cloud offerings. •creative revenue of $7.74 billion increased by $1.25 billion, or 19%, during fiscal 2020, from $6.48 billion in fiscal 2019. document cloud revenue of $1.50 billion increased by $272 million, or 22%, during fiscal 2020, from $1.22 billion in fiscal 2019. the increases were primarily due to subscription revenue growth associated with our creative cloud and document cloud offerings. •digital experience revenue of $3.13 billion increased by $330 million, or 12%, during fiscal 2020, from $2.80 billion in fiscal 2019. the increase was

advertising segment, which combined our advertising cloud offerings with our previous publishing segment. this realignment is consistent with how we manage our digital experience segment to better reflect the strategic shift related to advertising cloud and to align with our overall core value proposition of delivering on customer experience management. further, we reclassified revenue and related cost of revenue of our advertising cloud offerings from subscription to services and other on our consolidated statements of income. financial information for all fiscal years presented has

driven by increases in revenue associated with our creative and document cloud offerings due to increased demand and digital engagement amid the work-from-home environment. revenue associated with our creative offerings, which includes our creative cloud, perpetually licensed creative and stock photography offerings, increased during fiscal 2020 primarily due to increases in net new subscriptions across our creative cloud offerings. document cloud revenue, which includes our acrobat product family and adobe sign service, increased during fiscal 2020 primarily due to increases in subscription revenue driven by strong adoption of our document cloud offerings including adobe sign. digital experience revenue from digital experience increased $330 million during fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to subscription revenue growth across our offerings of which the largest contributors were our aem and marketo engage offerings. geographical information (dollars in

geographic regions as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to increases in digital media revenue and, to a lesser extent, increases in digital experience revenue. within each geographic region, the fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above. included in the overall change in revenue for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were impacts associated with foreign currency as shown below. our cash flow hedging program is used to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency impact to revenue.

(**) percentage is not meaningful. interest expense interest expense represents interest associated with our debt instruments. interest on our notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on february 1 and august 1. interest on our term loan, which was terminated in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, was payable periodically at the end of each interest period. floating interest payments on the interest rate swaps, which matured in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, were paid monthly and the fixed-rate interest receivable on the swaps was received semi-annually concurrent with the notes interest payments. interest expense decreased during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower average interest rates on our debt instruments that were refinanced in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. investment gains (losses), net investment gains (losses), net consists principally of unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets which are classified as trading securities, and gains and losses associated with our direct and indirect investments in privately held companies. investment gains (losses), net decreased during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the gain recognized upon our acquisition of the remaining interest in allegorithmic in january 2019. other income (expense), net other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments. other income (expense), net also includes realized gains and losses on fixed income investments and foreign exchange gains and losses. other income (expense), remained stable during fiscal 2020 primarily due to decreases in interest income driven by lower average interest rates offset by our change in methodology of accounting for foreign currency cash flow hedges. effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, option premiums, which were previously recorded in other income (expense), net, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). provision for (benefit from) income taxes (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 % change 2020-2019 provision for (benefit from) income taxes $(1,084) $254 $203 ** percentage of total revenue (8) % 2 % 2 % effective tax rate (26) % 8 % 7 % _________________________________________ (**) percentage is not meaningful. our effective tax rate decreased by approximately 34 percentage points during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. the change is primarily due to non-recurring tax benefits resulting from the intra-entity transfers of certain intellectual property rights (\"ip rights\") completed during fiscal 2020. our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was lower than the u.s. federal statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits resulting from the intra-entity transfers of certain ip rights, a favorable geographic mix of earnings and tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. during fiscal 2020, we completed intra-entity transfers of certain ip rights to our irish subsidiary in order to better align the ownership of these rights with how our business operates. the transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred ip rights. as a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits of $224 million and $1.13 billion, based on the fair value of the ip rights transferred in april and november 2020, respectively. the tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred ip rights will be recognized over the period of economic benefit. in years beyond fiscal 2020, the change in the geographic mix of international income resulting from these transfers is anticipated to adversely affect our effective income tax rates and cash flows. however, the adverse impact to effective rates for cash paid for income taxes will be partially offset by future deductions on the transferred ip rights. on december 22, 2017, the u.s. tax act was enacted into law, which significantly changed existing u.s. tax law and includes many provisions applicable to us. certain international provisions of the u.s. tax act, such as a tax on global intangible low-tax income, a base erosion and anti-abuse tax and a special tax deduction for foreign-derived intangible income, took effect in fiscal 2019. as the u.s. treasury releases regulations that impact these provisions, we account for finalized regulations in the period of enactment. we recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe these assets are more likely than not to be realized. in making such a determination, we considered all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, forecasted earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. on the basis of this evaluation, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount realizable. the total valuation allowance was $276 million as of november 27, 2020 and is primarily attributable to certain state and foreign credits and foreign intangible assets. we are a united states-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple u.s. and foreign tax jurisdictions. a significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our irish subsidiaries. the current u.s. tax law provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after december 31, 2017, including certain earnings that were not subject to the one-time transition or global intangible low-tax income tax. as we repatriate the undistributed foreign earnings for use in the u.s., the distributions will generally not be subject to further u.s. federal tax. in june 2020, california enacted legislation which includes a limitation on the utilization of research and development tax credits for a three-year period beginning in fiscal 2021. the net impact of the legislation is uncertain but is anticipated to increase our california tax and, consequently, adversely impact our effective tax rates for the three-year period beginning in fiscal 2021. see note 10 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our provision for (benefit from) income taxes. accounting for uncertainty in income taxes the gross liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties were $201 million, $173 million and $196 million for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. if the total unrecognized tax benefits at november 27, 2020, november 29, 2019 and november 30, 2018 were recognized, $136 million, $116 million and $136 million would decrease the respective effective tax rates. the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns were approximately $26 million and $25 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. these amounts were included in long-term income taxes payable in their respective years. the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. these events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of our tax assets and liabilities. we believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $20 million over the next 12 months. in addition, in countries where we conduct business and in jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax, including those covered by governing bodies that enact tax laws applicable to us, such as the european commission of the european union, we are subject to potential changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as adobe. these countries, other governmental bodies and intergovernmental economic organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development, have or could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and historically applied the rules and regulations described above in such jurisdictions. in the current global tax policy environment, any changes in laws, regulations and interpretations related to these assertions could adversely affect our effective tax rates, cause us to respond by making changes to our business structure, or result in other costs to us which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. moreover, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the u.s. internal revenue service and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. these tax examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices, application of tax rules and other matters. we regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from these examinations. we cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. liquidity and capital resources this data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated statements of cash flows. as of (in millions) november 27, 2020 november 29, 2019 cash and cash equivalents $4,478 $2,650 short-term investments $1,514 $1,527 working capital $2,634 $(1,696) stockholders' equity $13,264 $10,530 working capital working capital as of november 27, 2020 and november 29, 2019 was $2.63 billion of a surplus and $1.70 billion of a deficit, respectively. during the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we refinanced our 2.25 billion term loan due april 30, 2020 (\"term loan\") and $900 million 4.75% senior notes due february 1, 2020 (\"2020 notes\"). see the section titled \"cash flows from financing activities\" below. a summary of our cash flows for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 is as follows: (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 net cash provided by operating activities $5,727 $4,422 $4,029 net cash used for investing activities (414) (456) (4,685) net cash used for financing activities (3,488) (2,946) (5) effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 3 (13) (2) net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $1,828 $1,007 $(663) our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue and, to a lesser extent, proceeds from participation in the employee stock purchase plan. the primary uses of cash are our stock repurchase program as described below, payroll-related expenses, general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of revenue. other uses of cash include business acquisitions, purchases of property and equipment and payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards. cash flows from operating activities for fiscal 2020, net cash provided by operating activities of $5.73 billion was primarily comprised of net income adjusted for the net effect of non-cash items. the primary working capital sources of cash were net income together with increases in deferred revenue and decreases in trade receivables, which were offset in part by increases in prepaid expenses and other assets. the increase in deferred revenue was primarily driven by digital media offerings with cloud-enabled services, and the decrease in trade receivables was largely attributable to strong collections. the primary working capital use of cash was due to increases in prepaid expenses and other assets driven by sales commissions paid and capitalized and, to a lesser extent, increases due to the timing of billings and payments associated with certain vendors. cash flows from investing activities for fiscal 2020, net cash used for investing activities of $414 million was primarily due to ongoing capital expenditures. these cash outflows were offset in part by proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases. cash flows from financing activities for fiscal 2020, net cash used for financing activities of $3.49 billion was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards, which were offset by proceeds from re-issuance of treasury stock for our employee stock purchase plan. see the section titled \"stock repurchase program\" discussed below. in february 2020, we issued $500 million of 1.70% senior notes due february 1, 2023 (\"2023 notes\"), $500 million of 1.90% senior notes due february 1, 2025 (\"1.90% 2025 notes\"), $850 million of 2.15% senior notes due february 1, 2027 (\"2027 notes\") and $1.30 billion of 2.30% senior notes due february 1, 2030 (\"2030 notes\"). we used the proceeds to repay the term loan and 2020 notes concurrently. see note 17 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our debt refinancing. other liquidity and capital resources considerations our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2021 due to changes in our planned cash outlay. cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of the pandemic and other risks detailed in part i, item 1a titled \"risk factors.\" while the pandemic has not negatively impacted our liquidity and capital resources to date, it has led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future. however, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, operating resource expenditure and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of november 27, 2020 consisted of asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, foreign government securities, money market mutual funds, municipal securities and time deposits. we use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash. we have a $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (\"revolving credit agreement\") with a syndicate of lenders, providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries through october 17, 2023. as of november 27, 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit agreement and the entire $1 billion credit line remains available for borrowing. as of november 27, 2020, we have $4.15 billion senior notes outstanding, consisting of the 2023 notes, 1.90% 2025 notes, 2027 notes, 2030 notes and the $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due february 1, 2025 (the \"3.25% 2025 notes,\" and together with the aforementioned notes, the \"notes\"). the notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. we expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff, and facilities expansion. as of november 27, 2020, we expect our capital investment to be approximately $550 million to $650 million, primarily to fund our san jose and bangalore construction projects through fiscal 2022. furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. subsequent to november 27, 2020, we completed our acquisition of workfront, a privately held company that provides a work management platform for marketers, for approximately $1.5 billion in cash consideration. see note 3 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this acquisition. stock repurchase program to facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. in may 2018, our board of directors granted us an authority to repurchase up to $8 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2021. during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $3.05 billion, $2.75 billion, and $2.05 billion, respectively. we enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the volume weighted average price (\"vwap\") of our common stock over a specified period of time. we only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is expected to be higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. there were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us. the financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. the parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average vwap of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. the following is a summary of our structured stock repurchases executed with large financial institutions during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018: (in millions, except average price per share) 2020 2019 2018 board approval dates shares average per share shares average per share shares average per share january 2017 - $- - $- 8.7 $230.43 may 2018 8.0 $376.38 9.9 $270.23 - $- total cost $3,024 $2,671 $2,002 for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by november 27, 2020, november 29, 2019 and november 30, 2018 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. as of november 27, 2020, $255 million of prepayments remained under the agreement. subsequent to november 27, 2020, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $950 million. this amount will be classified as treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets. upon completion of the $950 million stock repurchase agreement, $1.1 billion remains under our may 2018 authority. further, in december 2020, our board of directors granted us additional authority to repurchase up to $15 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2024. we have not drawn from our new $15 billion authority as of the issuance of these financial statements. see item 5, market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for share repurchases during the quarter ended november 27, 2020. off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations our principal commitments as of november 27, 2020 consist of our notes and obligations under operating leases, royalty agreements and various service agreements. see notes 16, 17 and 18 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our contractual commitments. contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of november 27, 2020: (in millions) payment due by period total less than

november 27, 2020, our maximum commitment for interest payments was $613 million for the remaining duration of our outstanding notes. covenants our revolving credit agreement contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. as of november 27, 2020, we were in compliance with this covenant. we believe this covenant will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. our notes do not contain any financial covenants. under the terms of our revolving credit agreement, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or if one currently exists. we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. transition taxes liability our transition tax liability which was accrued as a result of the u.s. tax act was approximately $390 million as of november 27, 2020 and is payable in installments through fiscal 2026. the u.s. tax act provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after december 31, 2017, including certain earnings that were not subject to the one-time transition or global intangible low-tax income tax. as we repatriate the undistributed foreign earnings for use in the u.s., the distributions will generally not be subject to further u.s. federal tax. accounting for uncertainty in income taxes see results of operations - provision for (benefit from) income taxes above and note 10 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for our discussion on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. royalties we have certain royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain offerings. royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit sold or a percentage of the underlying revenue. indemnifications in the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations. to the extent permitted under delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity. the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director's or officer's lifetime. the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.\"\"\"\n\n    Instruction:\n    Identify and summarize all sentences or phrases that are directly or indirectly

the investment portfolios of the funds bxc manages or sub-advises predominantly consist of loans and securities of non-investment grade companies spread across the capital structure including senior debt, subordinated debt, preferred stock and common equity. bxc is organized into two overarching strategies: private credit and liquid credit. private credit strategies include mezzanine lending funds, middle market direct lending funds (including blackstone secured lending fund (\"bxsl\") and blackstone private credit fund (\"bcred\"), both of which are business development companies (\"bdcs\")), our structured products group, stressed/distressed strategies (including stressed/distressed funds and credit alpha strategies) and energy strategies. liquid credit strategies consist of clos, closed-ended funds, open-ended funds and separately managed accounts. in december 2020, bxc acquired dci llc (\"dci\"), a san francisco based systematic credit investment firm. as part of the transaction, dci will be integrated into bxc as systematic strategies within its liquid credit strategies unit. our credit & insurance segment includes our insurer-focused platform, blackstone insurance solutions (\"bis\"). bis focuses on providing full investment management services for insurers' general accounts, delivering customized and diversified portfolios that include allocations to blackstone managed products and strategies across asset classes and blackstone's private credit origination capabilities. bis provides its clients tailored portfolio construction and strategic asset

generate revenue from fees earned pursuant to contractual arrangements with funds, fund investors and fund portfolio companies (including management, transaction and monitoring fees), and from capital markets services. we also invest in the funds we manage and we are entitled to a pro-rata share of the results of the fund (a \"pro-rata allocation\"). in addition to a pro-rata allocation, and assuming certain investment returns are achieved, we are entitled to a disproportionate allocation of the income otherwise allocable to the limited partners, commonly referred to as carried interest (\"performance allocations\"). in certain structures, we receive a contractual incentive fee from an investment fund in the event that specified cumulative investment returns are achieved (an \"incentive fee,\" and together with performance allocations, \"performance revenues\"). the composition of our revenues will vary based on market conditions and the cyclicality of the different businesses in which we operate. net investment gains and investment income generated by the blackstone funds are driven by value created by our operating and strategic initiatives as well as overall market conditions. fair values are affected by changes in the fundamentals of our portfolio company and other investments, the industries in which they operate, the overall economy and other market conditions. our response to covid-19 as the global response to novel coronavirus (\"covid-19\") continues to evolve, our primary focus has been the safety and wellbeing of our employees and their families, as well as the seamless functioning of the firm in serving our limited partner investors who have entrusted us with their capital, and our shareholders. in accordance with local government guidance and social distancing recommendations, the majority of our employees globally have been working remotely. our technology infrastructure has proven to be robust and capable of supporting this model. we have implemented rigorous protocols for remote work across the firm, including increased cadence of group calls and updates, and frequent communication across leadership and working levels. we are leveraging technology to ensure our teams stay connected and productive, and that our culture remains strong even in these unusual circumstances. while we are generally not meeting with our clients in person, we continue to actively communicate with our clients through videoconference, teleconference and email. investment committees continue to convene as needed, and the firm continues to operate across investment, asset management and corporate support functions. since july 2020, employees in our u.s. and european offices began returning to the office on a voluntary basis, consistent with local government guidelines, with testing, contact-tracing and social distancing and other safety protocols in place. we continue to closely monitor applicable public health and government guidance. business environment blackstone's businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in the u.s., europe, asia and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere in the world. global economic conditions in 2020 were significantly impacted by the covid-19 pandemic. following dramatic declines in global equity and credit markets in the first quarter of the year coupled with certain liquidity issues, markets generally experienced sharp recoveries later in the year as governments around the world implemented fiscal and monetary stimulus to counter the economic impacts of the pandemic. the recovery has been more recently aided by progress on covid-19 vaccine production and distribution. the global economy has, with certain setbacks, begun reopening and wider distribution of vaccines will likely encourage greater economic activity. nonetheless, the recovery could remain uneven, particularly given uncertainty with respect to the distribution and acceptance of the vaccines. in the u.s., the s&p 500 increased 18% in 2020, with positive returns across most sectors and particular strength in technology stocks, which were up 44%. the s&p energy, real estate and financial sectors posted negative returns in 2020, with energy in particular down 34% as commodity prices remained suppressed. despite rising during the second half of 2020, the price of west texas ended the year at $48.52 per barrel, 21% below the 2019 year-end price of $61. the bloomberg commodity index finished the year down 4%. 81 volatility increased sharply during the year, with the cboe volatility index averaging 29 in 2020, up 89% from the prior-year average of 15. global equity issuance increased 60% in 2020. merger and acquisition activity decreased slightly in 2020, with announced volumes down 4% compared to 2019. debt markets largely retraced their declines from early in 2020, with u.s. leveraged loans declining 0.5% overall in 2020 and high yield bonds increasing 5.5%. high yield spreads ended the year roughly in line with pre-covid levels and issuance increased 51% year-over-year. the federal reserve maintained the federal funds target range at 0.0%-0.25% and expanded its balance sheet since mid-march 2020 by more than $3 trillion to support new credit and liquidity facilities. the federal reserve expects to maintain the current pace of purchasing in the coming months. three-month libor ended the year at 0.24%, near historical lows. the u.s. treasury yield curve steepened towards the end of 2020, with ten-year yields rising 41 basis points from their trough in august to 0.91% by the end of 2020. two-year u.s. treasury yields remained relatively stable since their decline in the first quarter of 2020, ending the year at 0.12%. the u.s. unemployment rate was 6.7% at the end of 2020, representing a decline from 11.1% at the end of june, although it remains at an elevated level. wages grew, with average hourly earnings increasing 5.1% year-over-year based on the three-month average for production and nonsupervisory employees. new orders for durable goods in december increased for the eighth consecutive month, while u.s. retail sales increased 3.2% in 2020 compared to 2019. the industrial sector continued to show mixed signals, as industrial production declined 3.6% in the fourth quarter from the year-ago period. however, the institute for supply management purchasing managers' index increased in the fourth quarter, rising to 60.7 from 55.4 in the third quarter, signaling moderate expansion in the u.s. manufacturing sector. countries around the world continue to grapple with the economic impacts of the covid-19 pandemic. although a recovery is partially underway, it continues to be gradual, uneven and characterized by meaningful dispersion across sectors and regions, and could be hindered by persistent or resurgent infection rates. a potential next round of u.s. fiscal stimulus could provide meaningful support, along with continued accommodative monetary policy and wider distribution of vaccines. issues with respect to the distribution and acceptance of vaccines or the spread of new variants of the virus could adversely impact the recovery. overall, there remains significant uncertainty regarding the timing and duration of the economic recovery, which precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact of covid-19 on economic and market conditions. notable transactions on september 29, 2020, blackstone issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 1.600% senior notes due march 30, 2031 (the \"2031 notes\") and $400 million aggregate principal amount of 2.800% senior notes due september 30, 2050 (the \"2050 notes\"). on november 24, 2020, blackstone entered into an amended and restated $2.25 billion revolving credit facility. the amendment and restatement to the credit facility, among other things, increased the amount of available borrowings and

holding companies through which certain of the subsidiaries depicted are held. key financial measures and indicators we manage our business using certain financial measures and key operating metrics since we believe these metrics measure the productivity of our investment activities. we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap. see \"- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - note 2. summary of significant accounting policies\" and \"- critical accounting policies.\" our key non-gaap financial measures and operating indicators and metrics are discussed below. 83 distributable earnings distributable earnings is derived from blackstone's segment reported results. distributable earnings is used to assess performance and amounts available for dividends to blackstone shareholders, including blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of the blackstone holdings partnerships. distributable earnings is the sum of segment distributable earnings plus net interest income (loss) less taxes and related payables. distributable earnings excludes unrealized activity and is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable gaap measure of income (loss) before provision (benefit) for taxes. see \"- non-gaap financial measures\" for our reconciliation of distributable earnings. net interest income (loss) is presented on a segment basis and is equal to interest and dividend revenue less interest expense, adjusted for the impact of consolidation of blackstone funds, and interest expense associated with the tax receivable agreement. taxes and related payables represent the total gaap tax provision adjusted to include only the current tax provision (benefit) calculated on income (loss) before provision (benefit) for taxes and including the payable under the tax receivable agreement. further, the current tax provision utilized when calculating taxes and related payables and distributable earnings reflects the benefit of deductions available to the company on certain expense items that are excluded from the underlying calculation of segment distributable earnings and total segment distributable earnings, such as equity-based compensation charges and certain transaction-related charges where there is a current tax provision or benefit. the economic assumptions and methodologies that impact the implied income tax provision are the same as those methodologies and assumptions used in calculating the current income tax provision for blackstone's consolidated statements of operations under gaap, excluding the impact of divestitures and accrued tax contingencies and refunds which are reflected when paid or received. management believes that including the amount payable under the tax receivable agreement and utilizing the current income tax provision adjusted as described above when calculating distributable earnings is meaningful as it increases comparability between periods and more accurately reflects earnings that are available for distribution to shareholders. segment distributable earnings segment distributable earnings is blackstone's segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and assess performance across blackstone's four segments. segment distributable earnings represents the net realized earnings of blackstone's segments and is the sum of fee related earnings and net realizations for each segment. blackstone's segments are presented on a basis that deconsolidates blackstone funds, eliminates non-controlling ownership interests in blackstone's consolidated operating partnerships, removes the amortization of intangible assets and removes transaction-related charges. transaction-related charges arise from corporate actions including acquisitions, divestitures and blackstone's initial public offering. they consist primarily of equity-based compensation charges, gains and losses on contingent consideration arrangements, changes in the balance of the tax receivable agreement resulting from a change in tax law or similar event, transaction costs and any gains or losses associated with these corporate actions. segment distributable earnings excludes unrealized activity and is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable gaap measure of income (loss) before provision (benefit) for taxes. see \"- non-gaap financial measures\" for our reconciliation of segment distributable earnings. net realizations is presented on a segment basis and is the sum of realized principal investment income and realized performance revenues (which refers to realized performance revenues excluding fee related performance revenues), less realized performance compensation (which refers to realized performance compensation excluding fee related performance compensation and equity-based performance compensation). 84 fee related earnings fee related earnings is a performance measure used to assess blackstone's ability to generate profits from revenues that are measured and received on a recurring basis and not subject to future realization events. fee related earnings equals management and advisory fees (net of management fee reductions and offsets) plus fee related performance revenues, less (a) fee related compensation on a segment basis, and (b) other operating expenses. fee related earnings is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable gaap measure of income (loss) before provision (benefit) for taxes. see \"- non-gaap financial measures\" for our reconciliation of fee related earnings. fee related compensation is presented on a segment basis and refers to the compensation expense, excluding equity-based compensation, directly related to (a) management and advisory fees, net and (b) fee related performance revenues, referred to as fee related performance compensation. fee related performance revenues refers to the realized portion of performance revenues from perpetual capital that are (a) measured and received on a recurring basis, and (b) not dependent on realization events from the underlying investments. other operating expenses is presented on a segment basis and is equal to general, administrative and other expenses, adjusted to (a) remove the amortization of transaction-related intangibles, (b) remove certain expenses reimbursed by the blackstone funds which are netted against management and advisory fees, net in blackstone's segment presentation, and (c) give effect to an administrative fee collected on a quarterly basis from certain holders of blackstone holdings partnership units. the administrative fee is accounted for as a capital contribution under gaap, but is reflected as a reduction of other operating expenses in blackstone's segment presentation. adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (\"adjusted ebitda\"), is a supplemental measure used to assess performance derived from blackstone's segment results and may be used to assess its ability to service its borrowings. adjusted ebitda represents distributable earnings plus the addition of (a) interest expense on a segment basis, (b) taxes and related payables, and (c) depreciation and amortization. adjusted ebitda is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable gaap measure of income (loss) before provision (benefit) for taxes. see \"- non-gaap financial measures\" for our reconciliation of adjusted ebitda. operating metrics the alternative asset management business is primarily based on managing third party capital and does not require substantial capital investment to support rapid growth. since our inception, we have developed and used various key operating metrics to assess and monitor the operating performance of our various alternative asset management businesses in order to monitor the effectiveness of our value creating strategies. assets under management. assets under management refers to the assets we manage. our assets under management equals the sum of: (a) the fair value of the investments held by our carry funds and our side-by-side and co-investment entities managed by us plus the capital that we are entitled to call from investors in those funds and entities pursuant to the terms of their respective capital commitments, including capital commitments to funds that have yet to commence their investment periods, (b) the net asset value of (1) our hedge funds, real estate debt carry funds, bpp, certain co-investments managed by us, certain credit-focused funds, and our hedge fund solutions drawdown funds (plus, in each case, the capital that we are entitled to call from investors in those funds, including commitments yet to commence their investment periods), and (2) our funds of hedge funds, our hedge fund solutions registered investment companies, and breit, (c) the invested capital, fair value or net asset value of assets we manage pursuant to separately managed accounts, (d) the amount of debt and equity outstanding for our clos during the reinvestment period, 85 (e) the aggregate par amount of collateral assets, including principal cash, for our clos after the reinvestment period, (f) the gross or net amount of assets (including leverage where applicable) for our credit-focused registered investment companies, (g) the fair value of common stock, preferred stock, convertible debt, term loans or similar instruments issued by bxmt, and (h) borrowings under and any amounts available to be borrowed under certain credit facilities of our funds. our carry funds are commitment-based drawdown structured funds that do not permit investors to redeem their interests at their election. our funds of hedge funds, hedge funds, funds structured like hedge funds and other open-ended funds in our real estate, hedge fund solutions and credit & insurance segments generally have structures that afford an investor the right to withdraw or redeem their interests on a periodic basis (for example, annually or quarterly), typically with 30 to 95 days' notice, depending on the fund and the liquidity profile of the underlying assets. investment advisory agreements related to certain separately managed accounts in our hedge fund solutions and credit & insurance segments, excluding our bis separately managed accounts, may generally be terminated by an investor on 30 to 90 days' notice. fee-earning assets under management. fee-earning assets under management refers to the assets we manage on which we derive management fees and/or performance revenues. our fee-earning assets under management equals the sum of: (a) for our private equity segment funds and real estate segment carry funds, including certain breds and hedge fund solutions funds, the amount of capital commitments, remaining invested capital, fair value, net asset value or par value of assets held, depending on the fee terms of the fund, (b) for our credit-focused carry funds, the amount of remaining invested capital (which may include leverage) or net asset value, depending on the fee terms of the fund, (c) the remaining invested capital or fair value of assets held in co-investment vehicles managed by us on which we receive fees, (d) the net asset value of our funds of hedge funds, hedge funds, bpp, certain co-investments managed by us, certain registered investment companies, breit, and certain of our hedge fund solutions drawdown funds, (e) the invested capital, fair value of assets or the net asset value we manage pursuant to separately managed accounts, (f) the net proceeds received from equity offerings and accumulated distributable earnings of bxmt, subject to certain adjustments, (g) the aggregate par amount of collateral assets, including principal cash, of our clos, and (h) the gross amount of assets (including leverage) or the net assets (plus leverage where applicable) for certain of our credit-focused registered investment companies. each of our segments may include certain fee-earning assets under management on which we earn performance revenues but not management fees. our calculations of assets under management and fee-earning assets under management may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. in addition, our calculation of assets under management includes commitments to, and the fair value of, invested capital in our funds from blackstone and our personnel, regardless of whether such commitments or invested capital are subject to fees. our definitions of assets under management and fee-earning assets under management are not based on any definition of assets under management and fee-earning assets under management that is set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds that we manage. 86 for our carry funds, total assets under management includes the fair value of the investments held and uncalled capital commitments, whereas fee-earning assets under management may include the total amount of capital commitments or the remaining amount of invested capital at cost depending on whether the investment period has expired or as specified by the fee terms of the fund. as such, in certain carry funds fee-earning assets under management may be greater than total assets under management when the aggregate fair value of the remaining investments is less than the cost of those investments. perpetual capital. perpetual capital refers to the component of assets under management with an indefinite term, that is not in liquidation, and for which there is no requirement to return capital to investors through redemption requests in the ordinary course of business, except where funded by new capital inflows. perpetual capital includes co-investment capital with an investor right to convert into perpetual capital. dry powder. dry powder represents the amount of capital available for investment or reinvestment, including general partner and employee capital, and is an indicator of the capital we have available for future investments. performance eligible assets under management. performance eligible assets under management represents invested and to be invested capital at fair value, including capital closed for funds whose investment period has not yet commenced, on which performance revenues could be earned if certain hurdles are met. consolidated results of operations following is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations for each of the years in the three-year period ended december 31, 2020. for a more detailed discussion of the factors that affected the results of our four business segments (which are presented on a basis that deconsolidates the investment funds we manage) in these periods,

2019 revenues revenues were $6.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2020, a decrease of $1.2 billion compared to $7.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019. the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to decreases of $1.5 billion in investment income (loss) and $333.1 million in other revenue, partially offset by an increase of $620.4 million in management and advisory fees, net. 88 the decrease in investment income (loss) was primarily driven by the impacts of covid-19. investment income (loss) in our real estate and credit & insurance segments decreased $1.7 billion and $287.7 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase in our private equity segment of $494.2 million. the decrease in our real estate segment was primarily attributable to lower net unrealized appreciation of investment holdings in brep opportunistic funds and lower realized gains in the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the year ended december 31, 2019. brep opportunistic funds' carrying value increased 3.4% in the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to 17.6% in the year ended december 31, 2019. the decrease in our credit & insurance segment was primarily attributable to net unrealized depreciation of investments in our private credit strategies in the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to net unrealized appreciation in the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase in our private equity segment was primarily attributable to higher realized gains and higher net unrealized appreciation of investment holdings in corporate private equity in the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the year ended december 31, 2019. corporate private equity carrying value increased 11.9% in the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to 10.3% in the year ended december 31, 2019. the decrease in other revenue was primarily due to foreign exchange losses on our euro denominated bonds and cross-currency swaps. the increase in management and advisory fees, net was primarily due to increases in our real estate and private equity segments of $373.5 million and $205.5 million, respectively. the increase in our real estate segment was primarily due to the end of brep ix's fee holiday in 2019, the commencement of brep europe vi's investment period in the fourth quarter of 2019 along with the end of its fee holiday in the first quarter of 2020 and fee-earning assets under management growth in core+ real estate. the increase in our private equity segment was primarily due to the end of bcp viii, bep iii and bxls v's fee holiday during the third quarter of 2020 and a full year of base management fees from strategic partners viii. expenses expenses were $3.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2020, a decrease of $485.1 million, compared to $4.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019. the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of $479.1 million in total compensation and benefits, which was primarily due to a decrease of $514.5 million in performance allocations compensation. the decrease in performance allocations compensation was primarily due to the decrease in investment income (loss) - performance allocations, on which the compensation is based. other income (loss) year ended december 31, 2020 compared to year ended december 31, 2019 other income (loss) was $(4.8) million for the year ended december 31, 2020, a decrease of $449.2 million, compared to $444.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the decrease in other income (loss) was due to decreases of $252.3 million in net gains (losses) from fund investment activities and $197.0 million in change in tax receivable agreement liability. the decrease in net gain (losses) from fund investment activities was primarily due to decreases of $188.9 million in our credit & insurance segment and $86.2 million in our real estate segment, partially offset by an increase of $19.0 million in our private equity segment. the decrease in our credit & insurance segment was primarily driven by depreciation of consolidated clos and other vehicles during the first six months of 2020 and the deconsolidation of nine clo vehicles during the third quarter of 2020. see note 9. \"variable interest entities\" in the \"notes to consolidated financial statements\" in \"- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data\" of this filing. the decrease in our real estate segment was primarily driven by depreciation of investments in our consolidated real estate segment funds. the increase in our private equity segment was primarily due to appreciation of investments in our consolidated private equity segment funds. 89 the decrease in change in tax receivable agreement liability was primarily due to the reduction of the estimated cash savings to be realized by blackstone recorded in relation to the conversion during the year ended december 31, 2019. provision (benefit) for taxes the following table summarizes blackstone's tax position: year ended december 31, 2020 2019 2018 (dollars in thousands) income before provision (benefit) for taxes $2,617,520 $3,818,015 $3,512,941 provision (benefit) for taxes $356,014 $(47,952 )

non-controlling interest holders. (b) the change in valuation allowance for the year ended december 31, 2019 represents the change from july 1, 2019 to december 31, 2019, following the change to a taxable corporation. blackstone's provision (benefit) for taxes for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019 was $356.0 million and $(48.0) million, respectively. this resulted in an effective tax rate of 13.6% and -1.3%, respectively, based on our income before provision (benefit) for taxes of $2.6 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. the increase in blackstone's effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2020, compared to the year ended december 31, 2019, resulted primarily from the conversion in 2019. for the year ended december 31, 2020, blackstone was a corporation subject to federal and state corporate income taxes while for the first six months of the year ended december 31, 2019, the blackstone group l.p. was a publicly traded partnership with income directly taxable to common unitholders. the estimated tax benefit recorded on the date of the conversion was reflected in the year ended december 31, 2019. upon finalization of the 2019 tax returns, an adjustment was made to the tax basis step up related to the conversion, resulting in an increase to the effective tax rate for the period ended december 31, 2020. in addition, the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2020 benefited from a reduction in blackstone's valuation allowance, due to the tax basis utilization attributable to asset dispositions during the year. 90 additional information regarding our income taxes can be found in \"- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - note 15. income taxes\" of this filing. non-controlling interests in consolidated entities the net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests in consolidated entities and net income attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated entities is attributable to the consolidated blackstone funds. the amounts of these items vary directly with the performance of the consolidated blackstone funds and largely eliminate the amount of other income (loss) - net gains (losses) from fund investment activities from the net income (loss) attributable to the blackstone group inc. net income attributable to non-controlling interests in blackstone holdings is derived from the income before provision (benefit) for taxes at the blackstone holdings level, excluding the net gains (losses) from fund investment activities and the percentage allocation of the income between blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of blackstone holdings and blackstone after considering any contractual arrangements that govern the allocation of income such as fees allocable to blackstone. for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, the net income before taxes allocated to blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of blackstone holdings was 42.7% and 43.9%, respectively. the decrease of 1.2% was primarily due to conversions of blackstone holdings partnership units to shares of common stock and the vesting of shares of common stock. the other income (loss) - change in tax receivable agreement liability was entirely allocated to the blackstone group inc. operating metrics the following graphs and tables summarize the fee-earning assets under management by segment and total assets under management by segment, followed by a rollforward of activity for the years ended december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. for a description of how assets under management and fee-earning assets under management are determined, please see \"-key financial measures and indicators - operating metrics - assets under management and fee-earning assets under management.\" 91 note: totals may not add due to rounding. 92 year ended december 31, 2020 2019 real estate private hedge fund credit &amp;

(a) excludes investment vehicles where blackstone does not earn fees. (b) available capital represents total investable capital commitments, including side-by-side, adjusted for certain expenses and expired or recallable capital and may include leverage, less invested capital. this amount is not reduced by outstanding commitments to investments. (c) multiple of invested capital (\"moic\") represents carrying value, before management fees, expenses and performance revenues, divided by invested capital. (d) unless otherwise indicated, net internal rate of return (\"irr\") represents the annualized inception to december 31, 2020 irr on total invested capital based on realized proceeds and unrealized value, as applicable, after management fees, expenses and performance revenues. irrs are calculated using actual timing of limited partner cash flows. initial inception date of cash flows may differ from the investment period beginning date. (e) effective december 31, 2020, available capital was updated to include uncalled capital commitments until they are legally expired, which increased available capital. (f) the 8% realized net irr and 8% total net irr exclude investors that opted out of the hilton investment opportunity. overall brep international ii performance reflects a 7% realized net irr and a 7% total net irr. (g) brep co-investment represents co-investment capital raised for various brep investments. the net irr reflected is calculated by aggregating each co-investment's realized proceeds and unrealized value, as applicable, after management fees, expenses and performance revenues. (h) bpp represents the core+ real estate funds which invest with a more modest risk profile and lower leverage. committed capital and available capital are not regularly reported to investors in our core+ strategy and are not applicable in the context of these funds. (i) unrealized investment value reflects breit's net asset value as of december 31, 2020. realized investment value represents breit's cash distributions, net of servicing fees. the breit net return reflects a per share blended return, assuming breit had a single share class, reinvestment of all dividends received during the period, and no upfront selling commission, net of all fees and expenses incurred by breit. these returns are not representative of the returns experienced by any particular investor or share class. inception to date net returns are presented on an annualized basis and are from january 1, 2017. committed capital and available capital are not regularly reported to investors in our core+ strategy and are not applicable in the context of this vehicle. (j) breds high-yield represents the flagship real estate debt drawdown funds only and excludes breds high-grade. (k) blackstone core equity partners is a core private equity strategy which invests with a more modest risk profile and longer hold period than traditional private equity. (l) realizations are treated as return of capital until fully recovered and therefore unrealized and realized moics are not meaningful. if information is not available on a timely basis, returns are calculated from results that are reported on a three month lag and therefore do not include the impact of economic and market activities in the quarter in which such events occur. (m) funds presented represent the flagship credit drawdown funds only. the total credit net irr is the combined irr of the credit drawdown funds presented. (n) unrealized investment value reflects bxsl's net asset value as of december 31, 2020. realized investment value represents bxsl's cash distributions. bxsl's net return is annualized and calculated since inception starting on november 20, 2018, as the change in net asset value (\"nav\") per share during the period, plus distributions per share (assuming dividends and distributions are reinvested in accordance with the company's dividend reinvestment plan) divided by the beginning nav per share. segment analysis discussed below is our segment distributable earnings for each of our segments.

increase of $173.6 million, or 12%, compared to $1.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase in segment distributable earnings was primarily attributable to an increase of $411.8 million in fee related earnings, partially offset by a decrease of $238.1 million in net realizations. segment distributable earnings in our real estate segment in 2020 were higher compared to 2019. this was primarily driven by increased fee related earnings due to the end of brep ix's fee holiday in 2019, the commencement of brep europe vi's investment period in the fourth quarter of 2019 along with the end of its fee holiday in the first quarter of 2020 and growth in fee-earning assets under management in core+ real estate, partially offset by decreased net realizations. the global economy has, with certain setbacks, continued to reopen following the onset of the covid-19 pandemic and the related shutdowns or limitations in the operations of certain non-essential businesses. market rebounds across many asset classes have contributed to capital deployment, realization and fundraising activity. progress on covid-19 vaccine production and distribution, together with continued support from previously implemented fiscal and monetary stimulus, have aided the continuing economic recovery and could potentially accelerate such recovery. although certain investments in our real estate portfolio, such as those in the hospitality and retail sectors and in select office and residential assets in urban locations, have been materially impacted and could continue to be adversely affected, the majority of our aggregate global real estate portfolio in brep and core+ real estate businesses is in sectors that we believe are more resilient to the impact of covid-19. nevertheless, the recovery could remain uneven and characterized by 108 meaningful dispersion across sectors and regions, particularly given uncertainty with respect to the distribution and acceptance of the vaccines. the resurgence in covid-19 infection levels in certain geographies and a potential resulting market downturn may pose material risks. these risks potentially create additional pressure for certain of our portfolio companies' and investments' liquidity needs and their ability to meet financial obligations, including by adversely impacting operational performance. we have not experienced a period of significant dislocation since the first quarter of 2020, during which the liquidity of certain assets traded in the credit markets was limited. nonetheless, another period of such dislocation would impact the value of certain assets held by our funds, such funds' ability to sell assets at attractive prices or in a timely manner in order to avoid losses and the likelihood of margin calls from credit providers. a continuing market recovery, however, could contribute to increased activity over the longer term. we have also seen a continuing focus toward rent regulation as a means to address residential affordability caused by undersupply of housing in certain markets in the u.s. and europe, as well as an increasing focus on the institution of eviction limitations in response to the covid-19 pandemic in the u.s. in addition, the new presidential administration and the u.s. congress may introduce new or enforce existing policies and regulations that may create uncertainty for our business and investment strategies and could have an adverse impact on us and our portfolio companies. such conditions (which may be across industries, sectors or geographies) may contribute to adverse operating performance, including moderated rent growth in certain markets in our residential portfolio. see \"part i. item 1a. risk factors - risks related to our business - the

were $1.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2020, an increase of $411.8 million, or 54%, compared to $763.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase in fee related earnings was primarily attributable to increases of $373.5 million in management fees, net and $139.9 million in fee related performance revenues, partially offset by an increase of $86.8 million in fee related compensation. management fees, net were $1.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2020, an increase of $373.5 million compared to $1.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019, primarily driven by an increase in base management fees. base management fees increased $437.3 million primarily due to the end of brep ix's fee holiday in 2019, the commencement of brep europe vi's investment period in the fourth quarter of 2019 along with the end of its fee holiday in the first quarter of 2020 and fee-earning assets under management growth in core+ real estate. the annualized base management fee rate increased from 1.02% at december 31, 2019 to 1.14% at december 31, 2020. the increase was principally due to brep ix, the majority of which was under a base management fee holiday in 2019, and brep europe vi, which commenced its investment period in the fourth quarter of 2019 and came out of its fee holiday in the first quarter of 2020. fee related performance revenues were $338.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, an increase of $139.9 million, compared to $198.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase was primarily due to crystallization events in bpp europe, a bpp u.s. co-investment and an increase in breit's net asset value. fee related compensation was $618.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, an increase of $86.8 million, compared to $531.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase was primarily due to increases in management fees, net and fee related performance revenues, on which a portion of fee related compensation is based. 109 net realizations net realizations were $499.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, a decrease of $238.1 million, compared to $738.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the decrease in net realizations was primarily attributable to decreases of $244.6 million in realized performance revenues and $55.0 million in realized principal investment income, partially offset by a decrease of $61.4 million in realized performance compensation. realized performance revenues were $787.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, a decrease of $244.6 million, compared to $1.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019. the decrease was due to lower realized gains as a result of market impacts of covid-19 in the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the year ended december 31, 2019. realized principal investment income was $24.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, a decrease of $55.0 million, compared to $79.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the decrease was primarily due to redemptions in breds funds in the year ended december 31, 2019 and lower realized gains in brep funds in the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the year ended december 31, 2019. realized performance compensation was $312.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, a decrease of $61.4 million, compared to $374.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in realized performance revenues. fund returns fund return information for our significant funds is

increase in segment distributable earnings was primarily attributable to increases of $138.5 million in fee related earnings and $216.0 million in net realizations. segment distributable earnings in our private equity segment in 2020 were higher compared to 2019. this was primarily driven by an increase in fee related earnings from growth in fee-earning assets under management and an increase in

following the onset of the covid-19 pandemic and the related shutdowns or limitations in the operations of certain non-essential businesses. market rebounds across many asset classes have contributed to capital deployment, realization and fundraising activity. progress on covid-19 vaccine production and distribution, 112 together with continued support from previously implemented fiscal and monetary stimulus, have aided the continuing economic recovery and could potentially accelerate such recovery. although certain investments in our private equity portfolio, such as those in the travel, leisure and events sectors, have experienced material reductions in value and could continue to be adversely impacted, the majority of our aggregate non-energy portfolio in our corporate private funds is in sectors that we believe are more resilient to the impact of covid-19. nevertheless, the recovery could remain uneven and characterized by meaningful dispersion across sectors and regions, particularly given uncertainty with respect to the distribution and acceptance of the vaccines. the resurgence in covid-19 infection levels in certain geographies and a potential resulting market downturn may pose material risks. these risks potentially create additional pressure for certain of our portfolio companies' liquidity needs and their ability to meet financial obligations. a continuing market recovery, however, could contribute to increased activity over the longer term. in energy, oil prices have stabilized since the significant declines experienced in the first quarter of 2020. nonetheless, weakened market fundamentals continue to pose challenges, particularly in upstream energy, which represents 3% of the private equity segment's investment portfolio and less than 2% of blackstone's aggregate investment portfolio. an increased focus on energy sustainability due to concerns about climate change and the impact of carbon emissions, including potential alternatives to fossil fuels, has also exacerbated the impact of such weakened market fundamentals. the persistence of these weakened market fundamentals would further negatively impact the performance of certain investments in our energy and corporate private equity funds. in addition, the new presidential administration and the u.s. congress may introduce new or enforce existing policies and regulations that may create uncertainty for our business and investment strategies and could have an adverse impact on us and our portfolio companies. for example, new policies seeking to increase the corporate tax rate or raise the minimum wage could adversely affect our business and the profitability of our portfolio companies. see \"part i. item 1a. risk factors - risks related to our business - the global

was primarily attributable to an increase of $205.5 million in management and advisory fees, net, partially offset by increases of $35.2 million in other operating expenses and $31.8 million in fee

2019, primarily driven by an increase in base management fees. base management fees increased $245.5 million primarily due to the end of bcp viii, bep iii and bxls v's fee holidays during the third quarter of 2020 and a full year of base management fees from strategic partners viii. other operating expenses were $195.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, an increase of $35.2 million, compared to $160.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase was primarily due to growth in our bip, tactical opportunities and bxls businesses, partially offset by less travel and

increase in net realizations was primarily attributable to an increase of $408.5 million in realized performance revenues, partially offset by an increase of $174.4 million in realized performance compensation and a decrease of $18.2 million in realized principal investment income. realized performance revenues were $877.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, an increase of $408.5 million, compared to $469.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase was primarily due to higher realized performance revenues in corporate private equity and tactical opportunities.

closed investment periods the corporate private equity funds within the private equity segment have seven funds with closed investment periods: bcp iv, bcp v, bcp vi, bcp vii, bcom, bep i and bep ii. as of december 31, 2020, bcp iv was above its carried interest threshold (i.e., the preferred return payable to its limited partners before the general partner is eligible to receive carried interest) and would still be above its carried interest threshold even if all remaining investments were valued at zero. bcp v is comprised of two fund classes based on the timings of fund closings, the bcp v \"main fund\" and bcp v-ac fund. within these fund classes, the general partner is subject to equalization such that (a) the general partner accrues carried interest when the respective carried interest for 115 either fund class is positive and (b) the general partner realizes carried interest so long as clawback obligations, if any, for either of the respective fund classes are fully satisfied. as of december 31, 2020, bcp v was below its carried interest threshold, while bcp v-ac was above its carried interest threshold. bcp vi, bcp vii, bcom and bep i were above their respective carried interest thresholds. we are entitled to retain previously realized carried interest up to 20% of bcom's net gains. as a result, performance revenues are recognized from bcom on current period gains and losses. bep ii was below its carried interest threshold. hedge fund solutions the following table presents the results of operations for our hedge fund solutions segment: year ended december

million, or 22%, compared to $450.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase in segment distributable earnings was primarily attributable to increases of $20.4 million in fee related earnings and $78.7 million in net realizations. segment distributable earnings in our hedge fund solutions segment in 2020 were higher compared to 2019. this increase was primarily driven by increased realized performance revenues and realized principal investment income, partially offset by increased realized performance compensation. the global economy has, with certain setbacks, continued to reopen following the onset of the covid-19 pandemic and the related shutdowns or limitations in the operations of certain non-essential businesses. following a more muted period since the onset of the covid-19 pandemic, the market has experienced rebounds across many asset classes, and our hedge fund solutions segment largely recovered from the losses in composite returns experienced in the first quarter of 2020. the segment has also benefited from the recovery of liquidity in the market during the second half of 2020. progress on covid-19 vaccine production and distribution, together with continued support from previously implemented fiscal and monetary stimulus, have aided the continuing economic recovery and could potentially accelerate such recovery. nevertheless, the recovery could remain uneven and characterized by meaningful dispersion across sectors and regions, particularly given uncertainty with respect to the distribution and acceptance of the vaccines. the resurgence in covid-19 infection levels in certain geographies and a potential resulting market downturn may pose material risks to our hedge fund solutions segment, including by potentially causing investors to seek liquidity in the form of redemptions from our funds and adversely impacting management fees. we have not experienced a period of significant dislocation since the first quarter of 2020, 116 during which the liquidity of certain assets traded in the credit markets was limited. nonetheless, another period of such dislocation would impact the value of certain assets held by our funds, such funds' ability to sell such assets at attractive prices or in a timely manner in order to avoid losses and the likelihood of margin calls from credit providers. in addition, future market uncertainty could slow the pace of fundraising in our hedge fund solutions segment, which may result in a delay in management fees. a continuing market recovery, however, could contribute to increased activity over the longer term. in an equity market environment that generally has been characterized by relatively low volatility, investors may choose to reallocate capital away from traditional hedge fund strategies. our hedge fund solutions segment operates multiple business lines, manages strategies that are both long and short asset classes and generates a majority of its revenue through management fees. in that regard, the segment's revenues will depend in part on our ability to successfully grow such existing diverse business lines and strategies, and identify new ones to meet evolving investor appetites. over time we expect an increasing change in the mix of our product offerings to products whose performance-based fees represent a more significant proportion of the fees than has historically been the case for such products. in addition, the new presidential administration and the u.s. congress may introduce new or enforce existing policies and regulations that may create uncertainty for our business and investment strategies and may adversely affect the profitability of certain of our investments. see \"part i. item 1a. risk factors - risks related to our business -

related earnings were $346.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, an increase of $20.4 million, compared to $326.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase in fee related earnings was primarily attributable to an increase of $28.0 million in management fees, net, partially offset by an increase of $9.8 million in fee related compensation. management fees, net were $588.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, an increase of $28.0 million, compared to $560.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, primarily driven by an increase in base management fees. base management fees increased $26.1 million primarily driven by fee-earning assets under management growth in our individual investor and specialized solutions platform. fee related compensation was $161.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, an increase of $9.8 million, compared to $152.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase was primarily due to an increase in management fees, net, on which a portion of fee related compensation is based. net realizations net realizations were $202.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, an increase of $78.7 million, or 63%, compared to $124.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase in net realizations was primarily attributable to increases of $53.2 million in realized performance revenues and $32.4 million in realized principal investment income, partially offset by an increase of $6.9 million in realized performance compensation. realized performance revenues were $179.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, an increase of $53.2 million, compared to $126.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase was primarily driven by higher returns in our individual investor and specialized solutions platform compared to the year ended december 31, 2019. 117 realized principal investment income was $54.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, an increase of $32.4 million, compared to $21.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase was primarily due to the realized gains on our corporate treasury investments allocated to the segment. realized performance compensation was $31.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, an increase of $6.9 million, compared to $24.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase was primarily due to the increase in realized performance revenues. composite returns composite returns information is included throughout this discussion and analysis to facilitate an

december 31, 2020, a decrease of $16.0 million, compared to $270.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the decrease in segment distributable earnings was primarily attributable to a decrease of $26.8 million in net realizations, partially offset by an increase of $10.8 million in fee related earnings. segment distributable earnings in our credit & insurance segment in 2020 were lower compared to 2019, driven by lower net realizations due to lower realized principal investment income and realized performance revenues. the global economy has, with certain setbacks, continued to reopen following the onset of the covid-19 pandemic and the related shutdowns or limitations in the operations of certain non-essential businesses. although the pandemic has adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact the performance of our credit & insurance segment, the majority of the segment's portfolio is in sectors that we believe are more resilient to the impact of covid-19. the market has experienced rebounds across many asset classes, and our credit & insurance segment largely recovered from the losses in composite returns experienced in the first quarter of 2020. the segment has also benefited from the recovery of liquidity in the market during the second half of 2020. the continuing recovery has also contributed to capital deployment, realization and fundraising activity. progress on covid-19 vaccine production and distribution, together with continued support from previously implemented fiscal and monetary stimulus, have also aided the continuing recovery and could potentially accelerate such recovery. nevertheless, the recovery could remain uneven and characterized by meaningful dispersion across sectors and regions, particularly given uncertainty with respect to the distribution and acceptance of the vaccines. the resurgence in covid-19 infection levels in certain geographies and a potential resulting market downturn may pose material risks, which potentially create additional pressure for borrowers with respect to their ability to meet their debt payment obligations or increase their focus on deleveraging. our credit & insurance funds have, however, continued to actively manage their portfolios in order to limit downside and protect capital. further, we have not experienced a period of significant dislocation since the first quarter of 2020, during which the liquidity of certain assets traded in the credit markets was limited. nonetheless, another period of such dislocation would impact the value of certain assets held by our funds and such funds' ability to sell such assets at attractive prices or in a timely manner, each of which would adversely impact performance revenues in our credit & insurance segment. a continuing market recovery, however, could contribute to increased activity over the longer term. in energy, oil prices have stabilized since the significant declines experienced in the first quarter of 2020. nonetheless, weakened market fundamentals continue to pose challenges, particularly in upstream energy, which represents 3% of the credit & insurance segment's investment portfolio and less than 2% of blackstone's aggregate investment portfolio. an increased focus on energy sustainability due to concerns about climate change and the impact of carbon emissions, including potential alternatives to fossil fuels, has also exacerbated the impact of such weakened market fundamentals. the persistence of these weakened market fundamentals in the energy sector or in the credit markets more broadly would further negatively impact the performance of certain investments in our credit funds. in addition, the new presidential administration and the u.s. congress may introduce new or enforce existing policies and regulations that may create uncertainty for our business and investment strategies and may adversely affect the profitability of certain of our investments. see \"part i. item 1a. risk factors - risks related to our business - the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or covid-19, has caused severe disruptions in the u.s. and global

the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or covid-19, has caused severe disruptions in the u.s. and global economies and has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our performance and results of operations.\" sources and uses of liquidity we have multiple sources of liquidity to meet our capital needs, including annual cash flows, accumulated earnings in our businesses, the proceeds from our issuances of senior notes, liquid investments we hold on our balance sheet and access to our $2.25 billion committed revolving credit facility. on november 24, 2020, blackstone amended and restated its revolving credit facility to, among other things, increase the amount of the revolving credit facility from $1.6 billion to $2.25 billion and to extend the maturity date of the revolving credit facility from september 21, 2023 to november 24, 2025. as of december 31, 2020, blackstone had $2.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $2.6 billion invested in corporate treasury investments, against $5.7 billion in borrowings from our bond issuances, and no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. on september 29, 2020, blackstone issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 1.600% senior notes due march 30, 2031 and $400 million aggregate principal amount of 2.800% senior notes due september 30, 2050. blackstone intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the notes for general corporate purposes. for additional information see note 13. \"borrowings\" in the \"notes to consolidated financial statements\" in \"- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.\" in addition to the cash we received from our notes offerings and availability under our revolving credit facility, we expect to receive (a) cash generated from operating activities, (b) performance allocations and incentive fee realizations, and (c) realizations on the fund investments that we make. the amounts received from these three sources in particular may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter depending on the frequency and size of realization events or net returns experienced by our investment funds. our available capital could be adversely affected if there are prolonged periods of few substantial realizations from our investment funds accompanied by substantial capital calls for new investments from those investment funds. therefore, blackstone's commitments to our funds are taken into consideration when managing our overall liquidity and cash position. 127 we expect that our primary liquidity needs will be cash to (a) provide capital to facilitate the growth of our existing businesses, which principally includes funding our general partner and co-investment commitments to our funds, (b) provide capital to facilitate our expansion into new businesses, (c) pay operating expenses, including cash compensation to our employees, and other obligations as they arise, (d) fund modest capital expenditures, (e) repay borrowings and related interest costs, (f) pay income taxes, (g) repurchase share of our common stock and blackstone holdings partnership units pursuant to our repurchase program and (h) pay dividends to our shareholders and distributions to the holders of blackstone holdings partnership units. 128 our own capital commitments to our funds, the funds we invest in and our investment strategies as of december 31, 2020 consisted of the following: blackstone and senior managing directors general partner and certain other professionals (a) fund original remaining original remaining commitment commitment commitment commitment (dollars in thousands) real estate brep v (b) $52,545 $2,185 $- $- brep vi (b) 750,000 36,809 150,000 12,270 brep vii 300,000 33,652 100,000 11,217 brep viii 300,000 51,159 100,000 17,053 brep ix 300,000 205,693 100,000 68,564 brep europe iii (b) 100,000 13,231 35,000 4,410 brep europe iv 130,000 24,074 43,333 8,025 brep europe v 150,000 33,779 43,333 9,758 brep europe vi 130,000 97,024 43,333 32,341 brep asia i 50,000 10,335 16,667 3,445 brep asia ii 70,707 39,063 23,569 13,021 breds ii 50,000 6,227 16,667 2,076 breds iii 50,000 17,659 16,667 5,886 breds iv 50,000 40,894 -

2.800%, due 9/30/2050 $400,000 $5,732,400 (a) the notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the issuer and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the blackstone group inc. and each of the blackstone holdings partnerships. the notes contain customary covenants and financial restrictions that, among other things, limit the issuer and the guarantors' ability, subject to certain exceptions, to incur indebtedness secured by liens on voting stock or profit participating equity interests of their subsidiaries or merge, consolidate or sell, transfer or lease assets. the notes also contain customary events of default. all or a portion of the notes may be redeemed at our option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, prior to their stated maturity, at the make-whole redemption price set forth in the notes. if a change of control repurchase event occurs, the notes are subject to repurchase at the repurchase price as set forth in the notes. blackstone, through its indirect subsidiary blackstone holdings finance co. l.l.c., has a $2.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the \"credit facility\") with citibank, n.a., as administrative agent with a maturity date of november 24, 2025. borrowings may also be made in u.k. sterling, euros, swiss francs, japanese yen or canadian dollars, in each case subject to certain sub-limits. the credit facility contains customary representations, covenants and events of default. financial covenants consist of a maximum net leverage ratio and a requirement to keep a minimum amount of fee-earning assets under management, each tested quarterly. on july 16, 2019, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of common stock and blackstone holdings partnership units. under the repurchase program, repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. the timing and the actual number repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions. the repurchase program may be changed, suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date. 131 during the year ended december 31, 2020, we repurchased 9.0 million shares of common stock as part of the repurchase program at a total cost of $474.0 million. as of december 31, 2020, the amount remaining available for repurchases under the program was $307.2 million. dividends our intention is to pay to holders of common stock a quarterly dividend representing approximately 85% of the blackstone group inc.'s share of distributable earnings, subject to adjustment by amounts determined by our board of directors to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of our business, to make appropriate investments in our business and funds, to comply with applicable law, any of our debt instruments or other agreements, or to provide for future cash requirements such as tax-related payments, clawback obligations and dividends to shareholders for any ensuing quarter. the dividend amount could also be adjusted upward in any one quarter. for blackstone's definition of distributable earnings, see \"- key financial measures and indicators.\" all of the foregoing is subject to the qualification that the declaration and payment of any dividends are at the sole discretion of our board of directors, and our board of directors may change our dividend policy at any time, including, without limitation, to reduce such quarterly dividends or even to eliminate such dividends entirely. because the publicly traded entity and/or its wholly owned subsidiaries must pay taxes and make payments under the tax receivable agreements, the amounts ultimately paid as dividends by the blackstone group inc. to common shareholders in respect of each fiscal year are generally expected to be less, on a per share or per unit basis, than the amounts distributed by the blackstone holdings partnerships to the blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of the blackstone holdings partnerships in respect of their blackstone holdings partnership units. following the conversion, we expect to pay more corporate income taxes than we would have as a limited partnership, which will increase this difference between the per share dividend and per unit distribution amounts. dividends are treated as qualified dividends to the extent of blackstone's current and accumulated earnings and profits, with any excess dividends treated as a return of capital to the extent of the shareholder's basis. the following graph shows fiscal quarterly and annual per common shareholder dividends for 2020, 2019 and 2018. dividends are declared and paid in the quarter subsequent to the quarter in which they are earned. 132 with respect to fiscal year 2020, we paid to shareholders of our common stock a dividend of $0.39, $0.37, $0.54 and $0.96 per share in respect of the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively, aggregating $2.26 per share. with respect to fiscal years 2019 and 2018, we paid shareholders of our common stock aggregate dividends of $1.95 per share and $2.15 per share, respectively. the dividend for each of the second, third and fourth quarter of 2018 was $0.58, $0.64 and $0.58, respectively, and in each case included a $0.10 per share dividend from a portion of the after-tax proceeds received in connection with the conclusion of blackstone's sub-advisory relationship with fs investments. leverage we may under certain circumstances use leverage opportunistically and over time to create the most efficient capital structure for blackstone and our shareholders. in addition to the borrowings from our notes issuances and our revolving credit facility, we may use reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and securities sold, not yet purchased. all of these positions are held in a separately managed portfolio. reverse repurchase agreements are entered into primarily to take advantage of opportunistic yields otherwise absent in the overnight markets and also to use the collateral received to cover securities sold, not yet purchased. repurchase agreements are entered into primarily to opportunistically yield higher spreads on purchased securities. the balances held in these financial instruments fluctuate based on blackstone's liquidity needs, market conditions and investment risk profiles. 133 the following table presents information regarding these financial instruments in our consolidated statements of financial condition: repurchase securities agreements sold, not yet purchased (dollars in millions) balance, december 31, 2020 $76.8 $51.0 balance, december 31, 2019 $154.1 $75.5 year ended december 31, 2020 average daily balance $94.2 $56.1 maximum daily balance $152.8 $75.7 critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap. in applying many of these accounting principles, we need to make assumptions, estimates and/or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. these assumptions, estimates and/or judgments, however, are often subjective. actual results may be affected negatively based on changing circumstances. if actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. we believe the following critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates and/or judgments. for a description of our accounting policies, see note 2. \"summary of significant accounting policies\" in the \"notes to consolidated financial statements\" in \"-item 8. financial statements and supplementary data\" of this filing. principles of consolidation for a description of our accounting policy on consolidation, see note 2. \"summary of significant accounting policies-consolidation\" and note 9. \"variable interest entities\" in the \"notes to consolidated financial statements\" in \"-item 8. financial statements and supplementary data\" for detailed information on blackstone's involvement with vies. the following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of consolidation principles impact our financial results, and management's process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment. the determination that blackstone holds a controlling financial interest in a blackstone fund or investment vehicle significantly changes the presentation of our consolidated financial statements. in our consolidated statements of financial position included in this filing, we present 100% of the assets and liabilities of consolidated vies along with a non-controlling interest which represents the portion of the consolidated vehicle's interests held by third parties. however, assets of our consolidated vies can only be used to settle obligations of the consolidated vie and are not available for general use by blackstone. further, the liabilities of our consolidated vies do not have recourse to the general credit of blackstone. in the consolidated statements of operations, we eliminate any management fees, incentive fees, or performance allocations received or accrued from consolidated vies as they are considered intercompany transactions. we recognize 100% of the consolidated vie's investment income (loss) and allocate the portion of that income (loss) attributable to third party ownership to non-controlling interests in arriving at net income attributable to the blackstone group inc. the assessment of whether we consolidate a blackstone fund or investment vehicle we manage requires the application of significant judgment. these judgments are applied both at the time we become involved with the vie and on an ongoing basis and include, but are not limited to: 134 • determining whether our management fees, incentive fees or performance allocations represent variable interests - we make judgments as to whether the fees we earn are commensurate with the level of effort required for those fees and at market rates. in making this judgment, we consider, among other things, the extent of third party investment in the entity and the terms of any other interests we hold in the vie. • determining whether kick-out rights are substantive - we make judgments as to whether the third party investors in a partnership entity have the ability to remove the general partner, the investment manager or its equivalent, or to dissolve (liquidate) the partnership entity, through a simple majority vote. this includes an evaluation of whether barriers to exercise these rights exist. • concluding whether blackstone has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie - as there is no explicit threshold in gaap to define \"potentially significant,\" management must apply judgment and evaluate both quantitative and qualitative factors to conclude whether this threshold is met. revenue recognition for a description of our accounting policy on revenue recognition, see note 2. \"summary of significant accounting policies-revenue recognition\" in the \"notes to consolidated financial statements\" in \"-item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.\" for additional description of the nature of our revenue arrangements, including how management fees, incentive fees, and performance allocations are generated, please refer to \"part i. item 1. business - fee structure/incentive arrangements.\" the following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of revenue recognition principles impact our financial results, and management's process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment. management and advisory fees, net - blackstone earns base management fees from the investors in its managed funds and investment vehicles, at a fixed percentage of a calculation base which is typically assets under management, net asset value, total assets, committed capital or invested capital. the range of management fee rates and the calculation base from which they are earned, generally, are as follows: on private equity, real estate, and certain of our hedge fund solutions and credit-focused funds: • 0.25% to 1.75% of committed capital or invested capital during the investment period, • 0.25% to 1.50% of invested capital, committed capital or investment fair value subsequent to the investment period for private equity and real estate funds, and • 0.75% to 1.50% of invested capital or net asset value subsequent to the investment period for certain of our hedge fund solutions and credit-focused funds. on real estate, credit and mlp-focused funds structured like hedge funds: • 0.24% to 1.50% of net asset value. on credit and mlp-focused separately managed accounts: • 0.24% to 1.50% of net asset value or total assets. on real estate separately managed accounts: • 0.65% to 2.00% of invested capital, net operating income or net asset value. on funds of hedge funds, certain hedge funds and separately managed accounts invested in hedge funds: • 0.25% to 1.50% of net asset value. 135 on clo vehicles: • 0.40% to 0.50% of the aggregate par amount of collateral assets, including principal cash. on credit-focused registered and non-registered investment companies: • 0.25% to 1.20% of total assets or net asset value. the investment adviser of bxmt receives annual management fees based on 1.50% of bxmt's net proceeds received from equity offerings and accumulated \"distributable earnings\" (which is generally equal to its gaap net income excluding certain non-cash and other items), subject to certain adjustments. the investment adviser of breit receives a management fee of 1.25% per annum of net asset value, payable monthly. management fee calculations based on committed capital or invested capital are mechanical in nature and therefore do not require the use of significant estimates or judgments. management fee calculations based on net asset value, total assets, or investment fair value depend on the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds and could vary depending on the valuation methodology that is used as well as economic conditions. see \"-fair value\" below for further discussion of the judgment required for determining the fair value of the underlying investments. investment income (loss) - performance allocations are made to the general partner based on cumulative fund performance to date, subject to a preferred return to limited partners. blackstone has concluded that investments made alongside its limited partners in a partnership which entitle blackstone to a performance allocation represent equity method investments that are not in the scope of the gaap guidance on accounting for revenues from contracts with customers. blackstone accounts for these arrangements under the equity method of accounting. under the equity method, blackstone's share of earnings (losses) from equity method investments is determined using a balance sheet approach referred to as the hypothetical liquidation at book value (\"hlbv\") method. under the hlbv method, at the end of each reporting period blackstone calculates the accrued performance allocations that would be due to blackstone for each fund pursuant to the fund agreements as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of such date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. performance allocations are subject to clawback to the extent that the performance allocation received to date exceeds the amount due to blackstone based on cumulative results. the change in the fair value of the investments held by certain blackstone funds is a significant input into the accrued performance allocation calculation and accrual for potential repayment of previously received performance allocations. estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. see \"-fair value\" below for further discussion related to significant estimates and assumptions used for determining fair value of the underlying investments. fair value blackstone uses fair value throughout the reporting process. for a description of our accounting policies related to valuation, see note 2. \"summary of significant accounting policies-fair value of financial instruments\" and \"summary of significant accounting policies-investments at fair value\" in the \"notes to consolidated financial statements\" in \"-item 8. financial statements and supplementary data\" of this filing. the following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of fair value principles impact our financial results, and management's process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment. the fair value of the investments held by blackstone funds is the primary input to the calculation of certain of our management fees, incentive fees, performance allocations and the related compensation we recognize. the blackstone funds are accounted for as investment companies under the american institute of certified public accountants accounting and auditing guide, investment companies, and in accordance with the gaap guidance on investment companies and reflect their investments, including majority-owned and controlled investments (the 136 \"portfolio companies\"), at fair value. in the absence of observable market prices, we utilize valuation methodologies applied on a consistent basis and assumptions that we believe market participants would use to determine the fair value of the investments. for investments where little market activity exists management's determination of fair value is based on the best information available in the circumstances, which may incorporate management's own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment, and the consideration of a combination of internal and external factors, including the appropriate risk adjustments for non-performance and liquidity risks. blackstone has also elected the fair value option for certain instruments it owns directly, including loans and receivables and investments in private debt securities, the assets of consolidated clo vehicles and other proprietary investments. blackstone is required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value, including debt instruments, equity securities and freestanding derivatives. fair value of investments or instruments that are publicly traded securities that are publicly traded and for which a quoted market exists will be valued at the closing price of such securities in the principal market in which the security trades, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market on the valuation date. when a quoted price in an active market exists, no block discounts or control premiums are permitted regardless of the size of the public security held. in some cases, securities will include legal and contractual restrictions limiting their purchase and sale for a period of time, such as may be required under sec rule 144. a discount to publicly traded price may be appropriate in those cases; the amount of the discount, if taken, shall be determined based on the time period that must pass before the restricted security becomes unrestricted or otherwise available for sale. fair value of investments or instruments that are not publicly traded investments for which market prices are not observable include private investments in the equity or debt of operating companies or real estate properties. our primary methodology for determining the fair values of such investments is generally the income approach which provides an indication of fair value based on the present value of cash flows that a business, security, or property is expected to generate in the future. the most widely used methodology under the income approach is the discounted cash flow method which includes significant assumptions about the underlying investment's projected net earnings or cash flows, discount rate, capitalization rate and exit multiple. our secondary methodology, generally used to corroborate the results of the income approach, is typically the market approach. the most widely used methodology under the market approach relies upon valuations for comparable public companies, transactions, or assets, and includes making judgments about which companies, transactions, or assets are comparable. depending on the facts and circumstances associated with the investment, different primary and secondary methodologies may be used including option value, contingent claims or scenario analysis, yield analysis, projected cash flow through maturity or expiration, probability weighted methods or recent round of financing. in certain cases debt and equity securities are valued on the basis of prices from an orderly transaction between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services. in determining the value of a particular investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrices and market transactions in comparable investments and various relationships between investments. management process on fair value due to the importance of fair value throughout the consolidated financial statements and the significant judgment required to be applied in arriving at those fair values, we have developed a process around valuation that incorporates several levels of approval and review from both internal and external sources. investments held by blackstone funds and investment vehicles are valued on at least a quarterly basis by our internal valuation or asset management teams, which are independent from our investment teams. 137 for investments valued utilizing the income method and where blackstone has information rights, we generally have a direct line of communication with each of the portfolio company finance teams and collect financial data used to support projections used in a discounted cash flow analysis. the respective business unit's valuation team then analyzes the data received and updates the valuation models reflecting any changes in the underlying cash flow projections, weighted-average cost of capital, exit multiple, and any other valuation input relevant economic conditions. the results of all valuations of investments held by blackstone fund and investment vehicles are reviewed and approved by the relevant business unit's valuation sub-committee, which is comprised of key personnel from the business unit, typically the chief investment officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, chief compliance officer (or their respective equivalents where applicable) and other senior managing directors in the business. to further corroborate results, each business unit also generally obtains either a positive assurance opinion or a range of value from an independent valuation party, at least annually for internally prepared valuations for investments that have been held by blackstone funds and investment vehicles for greater than a year and quarterly for certain investments. our firmwide valuation committee, chaired by our chief financial officer and comprised of senior members of our businesses and representatives from corporate functions, including legal and finance, reviews the valuation process for investments held by us and our investment vehicles, including the application of appropriate valuation standards on a consistent basis. each quarter, the valuation process is also reviewed by the audit committee of our board of directors, which is comprised of our employee directors. the global outbreak of covid-19 required management to make significant judgments about the ultimate adverse impact of covid-19 on financial markets and economic conditions, which is uncertain and may change over time. these judgments and estimates were incorporated into the valuation process outlined herein. management's policies were unchanged and critical processes were executed in a remote working environment. income tax for a description of our accounting policy on taxes and additional information on taxes see note 2. \"summary of significant accounting policies\" and note 15. \"income taxes,\" respectively, in the \"notes to consolidated financial statements\" in \"-item 8. financial statements and supplementary data\" of this filing. our provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. current income taxes approximate taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the applicable enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. during the year ended december 31, 2019, the conversion resulted in a step-up in the tax basis of certain assets that will be recovered as those assets are sold or the basis is amortized. additionally, significant judgment is required in estimating the provision for (benefit from) income taxes, current and deferred tax balances (including valuation allowance), accrued interest or penalties and uncertain tax positions. in evaluating these judgments, we consider, among other items, projections of taxable income (including the character of such income), beginning with historic results and incorporating assumptions of the amount of future pretax operating income. these assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates that blackstone uses to manage its business. a portion of the deferred tax assets are not considered to be more likely than not to be realized due to the character of income necessary for recovery. for that portion of the deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance has been recorded. revisions in estimates and/or actual costs of a tax assessment may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, if any. off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business, we engage in off-balance sheet arrangements, including transactions in derivatives, guarantees, commitments, indemnifications and potential contingent repayment obligations. we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that would require us to fund losses or guarantee target returns to investors in our funds. 138 further disclosure on our off-balance sheet arrangements is presented in the \"notes to consolidated financial statements\" in \"-item 8. financial statements and supplementary data\" of this filing as follows: • note 9. \"variable interest entities,\" and • note 19. \"commitments and contingencies - commitments - investment commitments\" and \"- contingencies - guarantees.\" recent accounting developments information regarding recent accounting developments and their impact on blackstone can be found in note 2. \"summary of significant accounting policies\" in the \"notes to consolidated financial statements\" in \"-item 8. financial statements and supplementary data\" of this filing. interbank offered rates transition certain jurisdictions are currently reforming or phasing out their interbank offered rates (\"ibors\"), including, without limitation, the london interbank offered rates, euro interbank offered rate, tokyo interbank offered rate, hong kong interbank offered rate and singapore interbank offered rate. the timing of the anticipated reforms or phase-outs vary by jurisdiction, with most of the reforms or phase-outs currently scheduled to take effect at the end of calendar year 2021. blackstone is evaluating the operational impact of such changes on existing transactions and contractual arrangements and managing transition efforts. see \"part i. item 1a. risk factors - risks related to our business - interest rates on our and our portfolio companies' outstanding financial instruments might be subject to change based on regulatory developments, which could adversely affect our revenue, expenses and the value of those financial instruments.\" 139 contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies the following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations as of december 31,

equipment under agreements that expire through 2030. occupancy lease agreements, in addition to contractual rent payments, generally include additional payments for certain costs incurred by the landlord, such as building expenses, and utilities. to the extent these are fixed or determinable they are included in the table above. the table above includes operating leases that are recognized as operating lease liabilities, short-term leases that are not recorded as operating lease liabilities and leases that have been signed but not yet commenced which are not recorded as operating lease liabilities. the amounts in this table are presented net of contractual sublease commitments. (b) represents the principal amount due on the senior notes we issued. as of december 31, 2020, we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolver. (c) represents interest to be paid over the maturity of our senior notes and borrowings under our revolving credit facility which has been calculated assuming no pre-payments are made and debt is held until its final maturity date. these amounts exclude commitment fees for unutilized borrowings under our revolver. (d) these obligations represent commitments of the consolidated blackstone funds to make capital contributions to investee funds and portfolio companies. these amounts are generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the less than one year category. (e) represents obligations by blackstone's corporate subsidiary to make payments under the tax receivable agreements to certain non-controlling interest holders for the tax savings realized from the taxable purchases of their interests in connection with the reorganization at the time of blackstone's ipo in 2007 and subsequent purchases. the obligation represents the amount of the payments currently expected to be made, which are dependent on the tax savings actually realized as determined annually without discounting for the timing of the payments. as required by gaap, the amount of the obligation included in the consolidated financial statements and shown in note 18. \"related party transactions\" (see \"-item 8. financial statements and supplementary data\") differs to reflect the net present value of the payments due to certain non-controlling interest holders. 140 (f) the total represents gross unrecognized tax benefits of $0.5 million and interest and penalties of $0.5 million. in addition, blackstone is not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with gross unrecognized benefits of $32.4 million and interest of $3.4 million; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligations table. (g) these obligations represent commitments by us to provide general partner capital funding to the blackstone funds, limited partner capital funding to other funds and blackstone principal investment commitments. these amounts are generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the less than one year category; however, a substantial amount of the capital commitments are expected to be called over the next three years. we expect to continue to make these general partner capital commitments as we raise additional amounts for our investment funds over time. guarantees blackstone and certain of its consolidated funds provide financial guarantees. the amounts and nature of these guarantees are described in note 19. \"commitments and contingencies - contingencies - guarantees\" in the \"notes to consolidated financial statements\" in \"-item 8. financial statements and supplementary data\" of this filing. indemnifications in many of its service contracts, blackstone agrees to indemnify the third party service provider under certain circumstances. the terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in our consolidated financial statements as of december 31, 2020. clawback obligations performance allocations are subject to clawback to the extent that the performance allocations received to date with respect to a fund exceeds the amount due to blackstone based on cumulative results of that fund. the actual clawback liability, however, generally does not become realized until the end of a fund's life except for certain blackstone real estate funds, multi-asset class investment funds and credit-focused funds, which may have an interim clawback liability. the lives of the carry funds, including available contemplated extensions, for which a liability for potential clawback obligations has been recorded for financial reporting purposes, are currently anticipated to expire at various points through 2029. further extensions of such terms may be implemented under given circumstances. for financial reporting purposes, when applicable, the general partners record a liability for potential clawback obligations to the limited partners of some of the carry funds due to changes in the unrealized value of a fund's remaining investments and where the fund's general partner has previously received performance allocation distributions with respect to such fund's realized investments. as of december 31, 2020, the total clawback obligations were $108.6 million, of which $83.9 million was related to blackstone holdings and $24.6 million was related to current and former blackstone personnel. the split of clawback between blackstone holdings and current and former personnel is based on the performance of individual investments held by a fund rather than on a fund by fund basis. if, at december 31, 2020, all of the investments held by our carry funds were deemed worthless, a possibility that management views as remote, the amount of performance allocations subject to potential clawback would be $4.0 billion, on an after-tax basis where applicable, of which blackstone holdings is potentially liable for $3.8 billion if current and former blackstone personnel default on their share of the liability, a possibility that management also views as remote. see note 18. \"related party transactions\" and note 19. \"commitments and contingencies\" in the \"notes to consolidated financial statements\" in \"-item 8. financial statements and supplementary data\" of this filing. 141\"\"\"\n\n    Instruction:\n    Identify and summarize all sentences or phrases that are directly or indirectly related to \"organizational resilience\", including but not limited to: scholars have defined organizational resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” (vogus & sutcliffe, 2007: 3418).

commercial p&c insurance, north america personal p&c insurance, north america agricultural insurance, overseas general insurance, global reinsurance, and life insurance. for more information on our segments refer to \"segment information\" under item 1. we have grown our business through increased premium volume, expansion of product offerings and geographic reach, and acquisitions of other companies. refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for our most recent acquisitions. our product and geographic diversification differentiate us from the vast majority of our competitors and has been a source of stability during periods of industry volatility. our long-term business strategy focuses on sustained growth in book value achieved through a combination of underwriting and investment income. by doing so, we provide value to our clients and shareholders through use of our substantial capital base in the insurance and reinsurance markets. we are organized along a profit center structure by line of business and territory that does not necessarily correspond to corporate legal entities. profit centers can access various legal entities subject to licensing and other regulatory rules. profit centers are expected to generate underwriting income and appropriate risk-adjusted returns. our corporate structure has facilitated the development of management talent by giving each profit center's senior management team the necessary autonomy within underwriting authorities to make operating decisions and create products and coverages needed by its target customer base. we are focused on delivering underwriting profit by only writing policies which we believe adequately compensate us for the risk we accept. our insurance and reinsurance operations generate gross revenues from two principal sources: premiums and investment income. cash flow is generated from premiums collected and investment income received less paid losses and loss expenses, policy acquisition costs, and administrative expenses. invested assets are substantially held in liquid, investment grade fixed income securities of relatively short duration. claims payments in any short-term period are highly unpredictable due to the random nature of loss events and the timing of claims awards or settlements. the value of investments held to pay future claims is subject to market forces such as the level of interest rates, stock market volatility, and credit events such as corporate defaults. the actual cost of claims is also volatile based on loss trends, inflation rates, court awards, and catastrophes. we believe that our cash balance, our highly liquid investments, credit facilities, and reinsurance protection provide sufficient liquidity to meet unforeseen claim demands that might occur in the year ahead. refer to \"liquidity\" and \"capital resources\" for additional information . financial highlights for the year ended december 31, 2020 •net income was $3.5 billion compared with $4.5 billion in 2019, including after-tax catastrophe losses of $2.8 billion compared with $966 million in 2019. •the covid-19 global pandemic and related economic conditions adversely impacted our results of operations and growth in 2020, including: ◦net catastrophe losses included a covid-19 charge of $1,396 million pre-tax ($1,193 million after-tax), generated primarily from entertainment and commercial property-related business interruption, liability insurance products, and workers' compensation. these covid-19 losses added 4.5 percentage points to the p&c combined ratio. ◦net premiums written in consumer lines globally declined by 1.9 percent, or 0.9 percent on a constant-dollar basis, principally reflecting the impact of covid-19. a&h lines experienced negative growth globally and were down 10.6 percent for the year. partially offsetting the decline was our u.s. high net worth personal lines business, which grew 2.8 percent in 2020. •net

cash flow was $9.8 billion compared with $6.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $3.4 billion primarily due to higher premiums collected and reduced payment activity due to the economic slowdown related to covid-19 pandemic. refer to the liquidity section for additional information on our cash flows. •net investment income was $3,375 million compared with $3,426 million in 2019. •share repurchases totaled $516 million, or approximately 3.6 million shares for the year, at an average purchase price of $143.91 per share. •shareholders' equity increased 7.4 percent during the year, principally reflecting strong underlying growth and realized and unrealized gains in our investment portfolio. outlook our premium growth in 2020 reflected increases in commercial p&c lines globally from new business, positive rate increases and higher renewal retention. this growth was tempered by decreases in consumer lines, primarily from outside north america, reflecting the adverse impact of the economic contraction resulting from the covid-19 pandemic. looking forward, we are off to a good start to the year in the first quarter with both growth and the level of commercial p&c rate increases resembling the underwriting conditions of the fourth quarter. we expect the current market condition to continue which will allow us to continue to grow revenue and expand underwriting margins in our commercial lines. for consumer lines, growth globally in the fourth quarter of 2020 continued to be impacted by the pandemic's effects on consumer-related activities. our international personal lines business and our global a&h business together shrank eight percent. we expect growth to return in these businesses as the year progresses. in 2019, chubb entered into agreements to acquire an additional 22.4 percent ownership interest in huatai group through two separate purchases. the first purchase, which was for a 15.3 percent interest, was completed in july 2020. we expect that the second purchase, which was for a 7.1 percent interest, will be completed in the future, contingent upon important conditions. separately, in november 2020, we completed the purchase of an incremental 0.9 percent ownership interest in huatai group, bringing chubb's aggregate ownership interest to 47.1 percent as of december 31, 2020. we continue to apply equity method accounting until we complete the 7.1 percent purchase, which will result in majority ownership at which point we expect to apply consolidation accounting. critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements include amounts that, either by their nature or due to requirements of generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. (gaap), are determined using best estimates and assumptions. while we believe that the amounts included in our consolidated financial statements reflect our best judgment, actual amounts could ultimately materially differ from those currently presented. we believe the items that require the most subjective and complex estimates are: •unpaid loss and loss expense reserves, including long-tail asbestos and environmental (a&e) reserves and non-a&e casualty exposures; •future policy benefits reserves; •the valuation of value of business acquired (voba) and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and voba; •the assessment of risk transfer for certain structured insurance and reinsurance contracts; •reinsurance recoverable, including a valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance; •the valuation of our investment portfolio and assessment of valuation allowance for expected credit losses; •the valuation of deferred income taxes; •the valuation of derivative instruments related to guaranteed living benefits (glb); and •the assessment of goodwill for impairment. we believe our accounting policies for these items are of critical importance to our consolidated financial statements. the following discussion provides more information regarding the estimates and assumptions required to arrive at these amounts and should be read in conjunction with the sections entitled: prior period development, asbestos and environmental (a&e), reinsurance recoverable on ceded reinsurance, investments, and net realized and unrealized gains (losses). unpaid losses and loss expenses as an insurance and reinsurance company, we are required by applicable laws and regulations and gaap to establish loss and loss expense reserves for the estimated unpaid portion of the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses under the terms of our policies and agreements with our insured and reinsured customers. at december 31, 2020, our gross unpaid loss and loss expense reserves were $67.8 billion and our net unpaid loss and loss expense reserves were $53.2 billion. with the exception of certain structured settlements, for which the timing and amount of future claim payments are reliably determinable, and certain reserves for unsettled claims, our loss reserves are not discounted for the time value of money. in connection with such structured settlements and certain reserves for unsettled claims, we carried net discounted reserves of $68 million and $74 million at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the following table presents a roll-forward of our unpaid losses and loss expenses: december 31, 2020 december 31, 2019 (in millions of u.s. dollars) gross losses reinsurance recoverable(1) net losses gross losses reinsurance

(1)net of valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. the estimate of the liabilities includes provisions for claims that have been reported but are unpaid at the balance sheet date (case reserves) and for obligations on claims that have been incurred but not reported (ibnr) at the balance sheet date. ibnr may also include provisions to account for the possibility that reported claims may settle for amounts that differ from the established case reserves. loss reserves also include an estimate of expenses associated with processing and settling unpaid claims (loss expenses). our loss reserves comprise approximately 78 percent casualty-related business, which typically encompasses long-tail risks, and other risks where a high degree of judgment is required. the process of establishing loss reserves for property and casualty claims can be complex and is subject to considerable uncertainty as it requires the use of informed estimates and judgments based on circumstances underlying the insured losses known at the date of accrual. for example, the reserves established for high excess casualty claims, asbestos and environmental claims, claims from major catastrophic events, or for our various product lines each require different assumptions and judgments to be made. necessary judgments are based on numerous factors and may be revised as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed, as new or improved methods are developed, or as laws change. hence, ultimate loss payments may differ from the estimate of the ultimate liabilities made at the balance sheet date. changes to our previous estimates of prior period loss reserves impact the reported calendar year underwriting results adversely if our estimates increase or favorably if our estimates decrease. the potential for variation in loss reserve estimates is impacted by numerous factors. reserve estimates for casualty lines are particularly uncertain given the lengthy reporting patterns and corresponding need for ibnr. case reserves for those claims reported by insureds or ceding companies to us prior to the balance sheet date and where we have sufficient information are determined by our claims personnel as appropriate based on the circumstances of the claim(s), standard claim handling practices, and professional judgment. furthermore, for our brandywine run-off operations and our assumed reinsurance operation, global reinsurance, we may adjust the case reserves as notified by the ceding company if the judgment of our respective claims department differs from that of the cedant. with respect to ibnr reserves and those claims that have been incurred but not reported prior to the balance sheet date, there is, by definition, limited actual information to form the case reserve estimate and reliance is placed upon historical loss experience and actuarial methods to estimate the ultimate loss obligations and the corresponding amount of ibnr. ibnr reserve estimates are generally calculated by first projecting the ultimate amount of losses for a product line and subtracting paid losses and case reserves for reported claims. the judgments involved in projecting the ultimate losses may pertain to the use and interpretation of various standard actuarial reserving methods that place reliance on the extrapolation of actual historical data, loss development patterns, industry data, and other benchmarks as appropriate. the estimate of the required ibnr reserve also requires judgment by actuaries and management to reflect the impact of more contemporary and subjective factors, both qualitative and quantitative. among some of these factors that might be considered are changes in business mix or volume, changes in ceded reinsurance structures, changes in claims handling practices, reported and projected loss trends, inflation, the legal environment, and the terms and conditions of the contracts sold to our insured parties. determining management's best estimate our recorded reserves represent management's best estimate of the provision for unpaid claims as of the balance sheet date, and establishing them involves a process that includes collaboration with various relevant parties in the company. for information on our reserving process, refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. sensitivity to underlying assumptions while we believe that our reserve for unpaid losses and loss expenses at december 31, 2020, is adequate, new information or emerging trends that differ from our assumptions may lead to future development of losses and loss expenses that is significantly greater or less than the recorded reserve, which could have a material effect on future operating results. as noted previously, our best estimate of required loss reserves for most portfolios is judgmentally selected for each origin year after considering the results from a number of reserving methods and is not a purely mechanical process. therefore, it is difficult to convey, in a simple and quantitative manner, the impact that a change to a single assumption will have on our best estimate. in the examples below, we attempt to give an indication of the potential impact by isolating a single change for a specific reserving method that would be pertinent in establishing the best estimate for the product line described. we consider each of the following sensitivity analyses to represent a reasonably likely deviation in the underlying assumption. north america commercial p&c insurance - workers' compensation given the long reporting and paid development patterns for workers' compensation business, the development factors used to project actual current losses to ultimate losses for our current exposure require considerable judgment that could be material to consolidated loss and loss expense reserves. specifically, adjusting ground up ultimate losses by a one percentage point change in the tail factor (i.e., 1.04 changed to either 1.05 or 1.03) would cause a change of approximately $910 million, either positive or negative, for the projected net loss and loss expense reserves. this represents an impact of about 9.5 percent relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately $9.6 billion. north america commercial p&c insurance - liability as is the case for workers' compensation above, given the long reporting and paid development patterns, the development factors used to project actual current losses to ultimate losses for our current exposure require considerable judgment that could be material to consolidated loss and loss expense reserves. specifically, for our main u.s. excess/umbrella portfolios, a five percentage point change in the tail factor (e.g., 1.10 changed to either 1.15 or 1.05) would cause a change of approximately $546 million, either positive or negative, for the projected net loss and loss expense reserves. this represents an impact of about 19.7 percent relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately $2.8 billion for these portfolios. the reserve portfolio for our chubb bermuda operations contains exposure to predominantly high excess liability coverage on an occurrence-first-reported basis (typically with attachment points in excess of $325 million and gross limits of up to $150 million) and d&o and other professional liability coverage on a claims-made basis (typically with attachment points in excess of $125 million and gross limits of up to $75 million). due to the layer of exposure covered, the expected frequency for this book is very low. as a result of the low frequency/high severity nature of the book, a small difference in the actual vs. expected claim frequency, either positive or negative, could result in a material change to the projected ultimate loss if such change in claim frequency was related to a policy where close to maximum limits were deployed. north america personal p&c insurance due to the relatively short-tailed nature of many of the coverages involved (e.g., homeowners property damage), most of the incurred losses in personal lines are resolved within a few years of occurrence. as shown in our loss triangle disclosure, the vast majority (approximately 95 percent) of personal lines net ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses are typically paid within five years of the accident date and over 80 percent within two years. even though there are significant reserves associated with some liability exposures such as personal excess/umbrella liability, our incurred loss triangle also shows a roughly consistent pattern of only relatively minor movements in incurred estimates over time by accident year especially after twenty-four months of maturity. while the liability exposures are subject to additional uncertainties from more protracted resolution times, the main drivers of volatility in the personal lines business are relatively short-term in nature and relate to things like natural catastrophes, non-catastrophe weather events, man-made risks, and individual large loss volatility from other fortuitous claim events. north america agricultural insurance approximately 59 percent of the reserves for this segment are from the crop related lines, which all have short payout patterns, with the majority of the liabilities expected to be resolved in the ensuing twelve months. claim reserves for our multiple peril crop insurance (mpci) product are set on a case-by-case basis and our aggregate exposure is subject to state level risk sharing formulae as well as third-party reinsurance. the majority of the development risk arises out of the accuracy of case reserve estimates and the time needed for final crop conditions to be assessed. we do not view our agriculture reserves as substantially influenced by the general assumptions and risks underlying more typical p&c reserve estimates. overseas general insurance certain long-tail lines, such as casualty and professional lines, are particularly susceptible to changes in loss trend and claim inflation. heightened perceptions of tort and settlement awards around the world can increase the demand for these products as well as contributing to the uncertainty in the reserving estimates. our reserving methods rely on loss development patterns estimated from historical data and while we attempt to adjust such factors for known changes in the current tort environment, it is possible that such factors may not entirely reflect all recent trends in tort environments. for example, when applying the reported loss development method, the lengthening of our selected loss development patterns by six months would increase reserve estimates on long-tail casualty and professional lines for accident years 2018 and prior by approximately $590 million. this represents an impact of 15.4 percent relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately $3.8 billion. global reinsurance at december 31, 2020, net unpaid losses and loss expenses for the global reinsurance segment aggregated to $1.5 billion, consisting of $772 million of case reserves and $740 million of ibnr. in comparison, at december 31, 2019, net unpaid losses and loss expenses for the global reinsurance segment aggregated to $1.4 billion, consisting of $769 million of case reserves and $664 million of ibnr. for our catastrophe business, we principally estimate unpaid losses and loss expenses on an event basis by considering various sources of information, including specific loss estimates reported by our cedants, ceding company and overall industry loss estimates reported by our brokers, and our internal data regarding reinsured exposures related to the geographical location of the event. our internal data analysis enables us to establish catastrophe reserves for known events with more certainty at an earlier date than would be the case if we solely relied on reports from third parties to determine carried reserves. for our casualty reinsurance business, we generally rely on ceding companies to report claims and then use that data as a key input to estimate unpaid losses and loss expenses. due to the reliance on claims information reported by ceding companies, as well as other factors, the estimation of unpaid losses and loss expenses for assumed reinsurance includes certain risks and uncertainties that are unique relative to our direct insurance business. these include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: •the reported claims information could be inaccurate; •typically, a lag exists between the reporting of a loss event to a ceding company and its reporting to us as a reinsurance claim. the use of a broker to transmit financial information from a ceding company to us increases the reporting lag. because most of our reinsurance business is produced by brokers, ceding companies generally first submit claim and other financial information to brokers, who then report the proportionate share of such information to each reinsurer of a particular treaty. the reporting lag generally results in a longer period of time between the date a claim is incurred and the date a claim is reported compared with direct insurance operations. therefore, the risk of delayed recognition of loss reserve development is higher for assumed reinsurance than for direct insurance lines; and •the historical claims data for a particular reinsurance contract can be limited relative to our insurance business in that there may be less historical information available. further, for certain coverages or products, such as excess of loss contracts, there may be relatively few expected claims in a particular year so the actual number of claims may be susceptible to significant variability. in such cases, the actuary often relies on industry data from several recognized sources. we mitigate the above risks in several ways. in addition to routine analytical reviews of ceding company reports to ensure reported claims information appears reasonable, we perform regular underwriting and claims audits of certain ceding companies to ensure reported claims information is accurate, complete, and timely. as appropriate, audit findings are used to adjust claims in the reserving process. we also use our knowledge of the historical development of losses from individual ceding companies to adjust the level of adequacy we believe exists in the reported ceded losses. on occasion, there will be differences between our carried loss reserves and unearned premium reserves and the amount of loss reserves and unearned premium reserves reported by the ceding companies. this is due to the fact that we receive consistent and timely information from ceding companies only with respect to case reserves. for ibnr, we use historical experience and other statistical information, depending on the type of business, to estimate the ultimate loss. we estimate our unearned premium reserve by applying estimated earning patterns to net premiums written for each treaty based upon that treaty's coverage basis (i.e., risks attaching or losses occurring). at december 31, 2020, the case reserves, net of retrocessions, reported to us by our ceding companies were $762 million, compared with the $772 million we recorded. our policy is to post additional case reserves in addition to the amounts reported by our cedants when our evaluation of the ultimate value of a reported claim is different than the evaluation of that claim by our cedant. typically, there is inherent uncertainty around the length of paid and reported development patterns, especially for certain casualty lines such as excess workers' compensation or general liability, which may take decades to fully develop. this uncertainty is accentuated by the need to supplement client development patterns with industry development patterns due to the sometimes low statistical credibility of the data. the underlying source and selection of the final development patterns can thus have a significant impact on the selected ultimate net losses and loss expenses. for example, a 20 percent shortening or lengthening of the development patterns used for u.s. long-tail lines would cause the loss reserve estimate derived by the reported bornhuetter-ferguson method for these lines to change by approximately $245 million. this represents an impact of 37 percent relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately $655 million. corporate within corporate, we also have exposure to certain liability reinsurance lines that have been in run-off since 1994. unpaid losses and loss expenses relating to this run-off reinsurance business resides within the brandywine division reported within corporate. most of the remaining unpaid loss and loss expense reserves for the run-off reinsurance business relate to a&e claims. the a&e liabilities principally relate to claims arising from bodily-injury claims related to asbestos products and remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites. the estimation of our a&e liabilities is particularly sensitive to future changes in the legal, social, and economic environment. we have not assumed any such future changes in setting the value of our a&e liabilities, which include provisions for both reported and ibnr claims. there are many complex variables that we consider when estimating the reserves for our inventory of asbestos accounts and these variables may directly impact the predicted outcome. we believe the most significant variables relating to our a&e liabilities include the current legal environment; specific settlements that may be used as precedents to settle future claims; assumptions regarding trends with respect to claim severity and the frequency of higher severity claims; assumptions regarding the ability to allocate liability among defendants (including bankruptcy trusts) and other insurers; the ability of a claimant to bring a claim in a state in which they have no residency or exposure; the ability of a policyholder to claim the right to unaggregated coverage; whether high-level excess policies have the potential to be accessed given the policyholder's claim trends and liability situation; payments to unimpaired claimants; and, the potential liability of peripheral defendants. based on the policies, the facts, the law, and a careful analysis of the impact that these factors will likely have on any given account, we estimate the potential liability for indemnity, policyholder defense costs, and coverage litigation expense. the results in asbestos cases announced by other carriers or defendants may well have little or no relevance to us because coverage exposures are highly dependent upon the specific facts of individual coverage and resolution status of disputes among carriers, policyholders, and claimants. for additional information refer to the \"asbestos and environmental (a&e)\" section and to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. future policy benefits reserves we issue contracts in our overseas general insurance and life insurance segments that are classified as long-duration. these contracts generally include accident and supplemental health products, term and whole life products, endowment products, and annuities. in accordance with gaap, we establish reserves for contracts determined to be long-duration based on approved actuarial methods that include assumptions related to expenses, mortality, morbidity, persistency and investment yields. for traditional long-duration contracts, these assumptions also include a provision for adverse deviation (pad), and are \"locked in\" at the inception of the contract, meaning we use our original assumptions throughout the life of the policy and do not subsequently modify them unless we deem the reserves to be inadequate; while for non-traditional long-duration contracts, the assumptions do not include a pad and are unlocked at each reporting date. the future policy benefits reserves balance is regularly evaluated for a premium deficiency. if experience is less favorable than assumptions, additional liabilities may be required, resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims. valuation of value of business acquired (voba), and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and voba as part of the acquisition of businesses that sell long-duration contracts, such as life products, we established an intangible asset related to voba, which represented the fair value of the future profits of the in-force contracts. the valuation of voba at the time of acquisition is derived from similar assumptions to those used to establish the associated future policy benefits reserves. the most significant input in this calculation is the discount rate used to arrive at the present value of the net cash flows. we amortize deferred policy acquisition costs associated with long-duration contracts and voba (collectively policy acquisition costs) over the estimated life of the contracts, generally in proportion to premium revenue recognized based upon the same assumptions used in estimating the liability for future policy benefits. for non-traditional long-duration contracts, we amortize policy acquisition costs over the expected life of the contracts in proportion to estimates of expected gross profits. the estimated life is established at the inception of the contracts or upon acquisition and is based on current persistency assumptions. policy acquisition costs, which consist of commissions, premium taxes, and certain underwriting costs related directly to the successful acquisition of a new or renewal insurance contract, are reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from future income, including investment income. unrecoverable costs are expensed in the period identified. risk transfer in the ordinary course of business, we both purchase (or cede) and sell (or assume) reinsurance protection. we discontinued the purchase of all finite risk reinsurance contracts, as a matter of policy, in 2002. for both ceded and assumed reinsurance, risk transfer requirements must be met in order to use reinsurance accounting, principally resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract as premiums and losses. if risk transfer requirements are not met, a contract is to be accounted for as a deposit, typically resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract through a deposit asset or liability and not as revenue or expense. to meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance contract must include both insurance risk, consisting of underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity. we also apply similar risk transfer requirements to determine whether certain commercial insurance contracts should be accounted for as insurance or a deposit. contracts that include fixed premium (i.e., premium not subject to adjustment based on loss experience under the contract) for fixed coverage generally transfer risk and do not require judgment. reinsurance and insurance contracts that include both significant risk sharing provisions, such as adjustments to premiums or loss coverage based on loss experience, and relatively low policy limits, as evidenced by a high proportion of maximum premium assessments to loss limits, can require considerable judgment to determine whether or not risk transfer requirements are met. for such contracts, often referred to as finite or structured products, we require that risk transfer be specifically assessed for each contract by developing expected cash flow analyses at contract inception. to support risk transfer, the cash flow analyses must demonstrate that a significant loss is reasonably possible, such as a scenario in which the ratio of the net present value of losses divided by the net present value of premiums equals or exceeds 110 percent. for purposes of cash flow analyses, we generally use a risk-free rate of return consistent with the expected average duration of loss payments. in addition, to support insurance risk, we must prove the reinsurer's risk of loss varies with that of the reinsured and/or support various scenarios under which the assuming entity can recognize a significant loss. to ensure risk transfer requirements are routinely assessed, qualitative and quantitative risk transfer analyses and memoranda supporting risk transfer are developed by underwriters for all structured products. we have established protocols for structured products that include criteria triggering an accounting review of the contract prior to quoting. if any criterion is triggered, a contract must be reviewed by a committee established by each of our segments with reporting oversight, including peer review, from our global structured transaction review committee. with respect to ceded reinsurance, we entered into a few multi-year excess of loss retrospectively-rated contracts, principally in 2002. these contracts primarily provided severity protection for specific product divisions. because traditional one-year reinsurance coverage had become relatively costly, these contracts were generally entered into in order to secure a more cost-effective reinsurance program. all of these contracts transferred risk and were accounted for as reinsurance. in addition, we maintain a few aggregate excess of loss reinsurance contracts that were principally entered into prior to 2003, such as the national indemnity company (nico) contracts referred to in the section entitled, \"asbestos and environmental (a&e)\". we have not purchased any other retroactive ceded reinsurance contracts since 1999. with respect to assumed reinsurance and insurance contracts, products giving rise to judgments regarding risk transfer were primarily sold by our financial solutions business. although we have significantly curtailed writing financial solutions business, several contracts remain in-force and principally include multi-year retrospectively-rated contracts and loss portfolio transfers. because transfer of insurance risk is generally a primary client motivation for purchasing these products, relatively few insurance and reinsurance contracts have historically been written for which we concluded that risk transfer criteria had not been met. for certain insurance contracts that have been reported as deposits, the insured desired to self-insure a risk but was required, legally or otherwise, to purchase insurance so that claimants would be protected by a licensed insurance company in the event of non-payment from the insured. reinsurance recoverable reinsurance recoverable includes balances due to us from reinsurance companies for paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses and is presented net of a valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is determined based upon a review of the financial condition of the reinsurers and other factors. ceded reinsurance contracts do not relieve our primary obligation to our policyholders. consequently, an exposure exists with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer is unable or unwilling to meet its obligations or disputes the liabilities assumed under the reinsurance contracts. we determine the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses using actuarial estimates as well as a determination of our ability to cede unpaid losses and loss expenses under existing reinsurance contracts. the recognition of a reinsurance recoverable asset requires two key judgments. the first judgment involves our estimation based on the amount of gross reserves and the percentage of that amount which may be ceded to reinsurers. ceded ibnr, which is a major component of the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses, is generally developed as part of our loss reserving process and, consequently, its estimation is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimation of gross ibnr (refer to \"critical accounting estimates - unpaid losses and loss expenses\"). the second judgment involves our estimate of the amount of the reinsurance recoverable balance that we may ultimately be unable to recover from reinsurers due to insolvency, contractual dispute, or for other reasons. estimated uncollectible amounts are reflected in a valuation allowance that reduces the reinsurance recoverable asset and, in turn, shareholders' equity. changes in the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance are reflected in net income. although the obligation of individual reinsurers to pay their reinsurance obligations is based on specific contract provisions, the collectability of such amounts requires estimation by management. the majority of the recoverable balance will not be due for collection until sometime in the future, and the duration of our recoverables may be longer than the duration of our direct exposures. over this period of time, economic conditions and operational performance of a particular reinsurer may impact their ability to meet these obligations and while they may continue to acknowledge their contractual obligation to do so, they may not have the financial resources or willingness to fully meet their obligation to us. to estimate the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, the reinsurance recoverable must first be determined for each reinsurer. this determination is based on a process rather than an estimate, although an element of judgment must be applied. as part of the process, ceded ibnr is allocated to reinsurance contracts because ceded ibnr is not generally calculated on a contract by contract basis. the allocations are generally based on premiums ceded under reinsurance contracts, adjusted for actual loss experience and historical relationships between gross and ceded losses. if actual premium and loss experience vary materially from historical experience, the allocation of reinsurance recoverable by reinsurer will be reviewed and may change. while such change is unlikely to result in a large percentage change in the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, it could, nevertheless, have a material effect on our net income in the period recorded. generally, we use a default analysis to estimate uncollectible reinsurance. the primary components of the default analysis are reinsurance recoverable balances by reinsurer, net of collateral, and forward looking default factors used to estimate the probability that the reinsurer may be unable to meet its future obligations in full. in 2020, we adopted new guidance on the accounting for expected credit losses of reinsurance recoverable. for additional information, refer to note 1 s) to the consolidated financial statements under item 8. the definition of collateral for this purpose requires some judgment and is generally limited to assets held in a chubb-only beneficiary trust, letters of credit, and liabilities held by us with the same legal entity for which we believe there is a right of offset. we do not currently include multi-beneficiary trusts. however, we have several reinsurers that have established multi-beneficiary trusts for which certain of our companies are beneficiaries. the determination of the default factor is principally based on the financial strength rating of the reinsurer and a corresponding default factor applicable to the financial strength rating. default factors require considerable judgment and are determined using the current financial strength rating, or rating equivalent, of each reinsurer as well as other key considerations and assumptions. significant considerations and assumptions include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: •for reinsurers that maintain a financial strength rating from a major rating agency, and for which recoverable balances are considered representative of the larger population (i.e., default probabilities are consistent with similarly rated reinsurers and payment durations conform to averages), the judgment exercised by management to determine the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance of each reinsurer is typically limited because the financial rating is based on a published source and the default factor we apply is based on a historical default factor of a major rating agency applicable to the particular rating class. default factors applied for financial ratings of aaa, aa, a, bbb, bb, b, and ccc, are 0.8 percent, 1.2 percent, 1.7 percent, 4.9 percent, 19.6 percent, 34.0 percent, and 62.2 percent, respectively. because our model is predicated on the historical default factors of a major rating agency, we do not generally consider alternative factors. however, when a recoverable is expected to be paid in a brief period of time by a highly-rated reinsurer, such as certain property catastrophe claims, a default factor may not be applied; •for balances recoverable from reinsurers that are both unrated by a major rating agency and for which management is unable to determine a credible rating equivalent based on a parent or affiliated company, we may determine a rating equivalent based on our analysis of the reinsurer that considers an assessment of the creditworthiness of the particular entity, industry benchmarks, or other factors as considered appropriate. we then apply the applicable default factor for that rating class. for balances recoverable from unrated reinsurers for which our ceded reserve is below a certain threshold, we generally apply a default factor of 34.0 percent; •for balances recoverable from reinsurers that are either insolvent or under regulatory supervision, we establish a default factor and resulting valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance based on specific facts and circumstances surrounding each company. upon initial notification of an insolvency, we generally recognize expense for a substantial portion of all balances outstanding, net of collateral, through a combination of write-offs of recoverable balances and increases to the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. when regulatory action is taken on a reinsurer, we generally recognize a default factor by estimating an expected recovery on all balances outstanding, net of collateral. when sufficient credible information becomes available, we adjust the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance by establishing a default factor pursuant to information received; and •for captives and other recoverables, management determines the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance based on the specific facts and circumstances. the following table summarizes reinsurance recoverables and the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance for each type of recoverable balance at december 31, 2020: gross reinsurance recoverables on losses and loss expenses recoverables (net of usable collateral) valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance (1) (in millions of u.s. dollars) type reinsurers with credit ratings $12,479 $10,814 $179 reinsurers not rated 290 154 57 reinsurers under supervision and insolvent reinsurers 64 60 35 captives 2,107 372 11 other - structured settlements and pools 966 965 32 total $15,906 $12,365 $314 (1) the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is based on a default analysis applied to gross reinsurance recoverables, net of approximately $3.5 billion of collateral at december 31, 2020. at december 31, 2020, the use of different assumptions within our approach could have a material effect on the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. to the extent the creditworthiness of our reinsurers was to deteriorate due to an adverse event affecting the reinsurance industry, such as a large number of major catastrophes, actual uncollectible amounts could be significantly greater than our valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. such an event could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and our liquidity. given the various considerations used to estimate our uncollectible valuation allowance, we cannot precisely quantify the effect a specific industry event may have on the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. however, based on the composition (particularly the average credit quality) of the reinsurance recoverable balance at december 31, 2020, we estimate that a ratings downgrade of one notch for all rated reinsurers (e.g., from a to a- or a- to bbb+) could increase our valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance by approximately $81 million or approximately 0.5 percent of the gross reinsurance recoverable balance, assuming no other changes relevant to the calculation. while a ratings downgrade would result in an increase in our valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance and a charge to earnings in that period, a downgrade in and of itself does not imply that we will be unable to collect all of the ceded reinsurance recoverable from the reinsurers in question. refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. fair value measurements accounting guidance defines fair value as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy based on the reliability of the inputs. the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (level 1 inputs) and the lowest priority to unobservable data (level 3 inputs). level 2 includes inputs, other than quoted prices within level 1, that are observable for assets or liabilities either directly or indirectly. refer to note 4 and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for information on our fair value measurements. assessment of investment portfolio credit losses each quarter, we evaluate current expected credit losses (cecl) for fixed maturity securities classified as held to maturity and expected credit losses (ecl) for fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale. because our investment portfolio is the largest component of consolidated assets, cecl and ecl could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. refer to notes 1 e) and 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more information. deferred income taxes at december 31, 2020, our net deferred tax liability was $892 million. our deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily result from temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities. we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities separately for each tax-paying component (an individual entity or group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes) in each tax jurisdiction. the realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax jurisdiction. there may be changes in tax laws in a number of countries where we transact business that impact our deferred tax assets and liabilities. at each balance sheet date, management assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all, or some portion, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the determination of the need for a valuation allowance is based on all available information including projections of future taxable income, principally derived from business plans and where appropriate available tax planning strategies. projections of future taxable income incorporate assumptions of future business and operations that are apt to differ from actual experience. if our assumptions and estimates that resulted in our forecast of future taxable income prove to be incorrect, an additional valuation allowance could become necessary, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. at december 31, 2020, the valuation allowance of $83 million reflects management's assessment that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized due to the inability of certain subsidiaries to generate sufficient taxable income. assumed reinsurance programs involving minimum benefit guarantees under variable annuity contracts chubb reinsures various death and living benefit guarantees associated with variable annuities issued primarily in the united states. we ceased writing this business in 2007. guarantees which are payable on death are referred to as guaranteed minimum death benefits (gmdb). guarantees on living benefits (glb) consist mainly of guaranteed minimum income benefits (gmib). for further description of this product and related accounting treatment, refer to note 1 j) to the consolidated financial statements. guaranteed living benefits (glb) derivatives our glb reinsurance is classified as a derivative for accounting purposes and therefore carried at fair value. changes in fair value are reflected in net realized gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of operations. determination of glb fair value the fair value of glb reinsurance is estimated using an internal valuation model, which includes current market information and estimates of policyholder behavior from the perspective of a theoretical market participant that would assume these liabilities. all of our treaties contain claim limits, which are factored into the valuation model. the fair value depends on a number of factors, including interest rates, equity markets, credit risk, current account value, market volatility, expected annuitization rates and other policyholder behavior, and changes in policyholder mortality. the model and related assumptions are regularly re-evaluated by management and enhanced, as appropriate, based upon additional experience obtained related to policyholder behavior and availability of more timely market information. due to the inherent uncertainties of the assumptions used in the valuation models to determine the fair value of these derivative products, actual experience may differ materially from the estimates reflected in our consolidated financial statements. we intend to hold these derivative contracts to maturity (i.e., the expiration of the underlying liabilities through lapse, annuitization, death, or expiration of the reinsurance contract). to partially offset the risk of changes in the fair value of glb reinsurance contracts, we invest in derivative hedge instruments. for further information on the estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair value of glb reinsurance, refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. for a sensitivity discussion of the effect of changes in interest rates, equity indices, and other assumptions on the fair value of glbs, and the estimated resulting impact on our net income, refer to item 7a. determination of gmdb benefit reserves management established benefit reserves based on a long-term benefit ratio (or loss ratio) calculated using assumptions reflecting management's best estimate of the future performance of the gmdb variable annuity line of business. despite the long-term nature of the risk, the benefit ratio calculation is impacted by short-term market movements that may be judged by management to be transient. management regularly examines both qualitative and quantitative analysis, including a review of the differential between the benefit ratio used at the most recent valuation date and the benefit ratio calculated on subsequent dates. management regularly evaluates its estimates and uses judgment to determine the extent to which assumptions underlying the benefit ratio calculation should be adjusted. for the year ended december 31, 2020, management determined that no change to the benefit ratio was warranted. risk management we employ a strategy to manage the financial market and policyholder behavior risks embedded in the reinsurance of variable annuity (va) guarantees. risk management begins with underwriting a prospective client and guarantee design, with particular focus on protecting our position from policyholder options that, because of anti-selective behavior, could adversely impact our obligation. a second layer of risk management is the structure of the reinsurance contracts. all va guarantee reinsurance contracts include some form of annual or aggregate claim limit(s) primarily designed to reduce our exposure to severe equity market and interest rate declines (which would cause an increase in expected claims). a third layer of risk management is the hedging strategy which looks to mitigate both long-term economic loss over time as well as dampen income statement volatility. we owned financial market instruments as part of the hedging strategy with a fair value liability of $17 million and $13 million at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the instruments are substantially collateralized on a daily basis. we also limit the aggregate amount of variable annuity reinsurance guarantee risk we are willing to assume. the last substantive transactions were quoted in late 2007. the aggregate number of policyholders is currently decreasing through policyholder withdrawals, annuitizations, and deaths at a rate of 5 percent to 15 percent per annum. note that glb claims cannot occur for any reinsured policy until it has reached the end of its \"waiting period\". as of december 31, 2020, 93 percent of the policies we reinsure reached the end of their \"waiting periods\". collateral chubb maintains collateral, including letters of credit (loc), on behalf of most of its clients in the form of qualified assets in trust or letters of credit, typically in an amount sufficient for the client to obtain statutory reserve credit for the reinsurance. the timing of the calculation and amount of the collateral varies by client according to the particulars of the reinsurance treaty and the statutory reserve guidelines of the client's domicile. refer to \"credit facilities\" for a discussion of the loc related to our variable annuity program. goodwill impairment assessment goodwill, which represents the excess of acquisition cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired, was $15.4 billion and $15.3 billion at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. goodwill is assigned to applicable reporting units of acquired entities at the time of acquisition. our reporting units are the same as our reportable segments. for goodwill balances by reporting units, refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. goodwill is not amortized but is subject to a periodic evaluation for impairment at least annually, or earlier if there are any indications of possible impairment. impairment is tested at the reporting unit level. the impairment evaluation first uses a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e., more than a 50 percent probability) that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount. if a reporting unit fails this qualitative assessment, a single quantitative analysis is used to measure and record the amount of the impairment. in assessing the fair value of a reporting unit, we make assumptions and estimates about the profitability attributable to our reporting units, including: •short-term and long-term growth rates; and •estimated cost of equity and changes in long-term risk-free interest rates. if our assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of acquired entities change, we could be required to write-down the carrying value of goodwill which could be material to our results of operations in the period the charge is taken. based on our impairment testing for 2020, we determined no impairment was required and none of our reporting units was at risk for impairment. consolidated operating

respectively, as well as the a&h results of our north america commercial p&c segment, are included in global a&h lines above. the increase in net premiums written in 2020 principally reflects positive growth in commercial p&c lines globally, partially offset by negative growth in consumer p&c lines primarily from outside north america. the increase in net premiums written principally reflected new business, positive rate increases and higher renewal retention. this growth was tempered by the adverse impact of the economic contraction resulting from the covid-19 pandemic, principally in consumer p&c lines. •the growth in commercial casualty was due to new business, positive rate increases and growth in north america, asia and europe, partially offset by the adverse impact of the covid-19 pandemic, including $58 million of exposure adjustments on in-force policies which depressed growth by 1.1 percentage points. •workers' compensation was adversely impacted by market conditions and by the adverse impact of the economic contraction resulting from the covid-19 pandemic. the decrease included $121 million of exposure adjustments on in-force policies which depressed growth by 5.8

offset by the impact of the covid-19 pandemic, which caused declines in automobile business in latin america and north america. •global a&h lines decreased in all regions, principally from less travel volume due to the covid-19 pandemic. •the increase in life was primarily driven by growth in latin america, principally driven by our expanded presence in chile, and in the asian international life operations. for additional information on net premiums written, refer to the segment results discussions. 49 net premiums earned net premiums earned for short-duration contracts, typically p&c contracts, generally reflect the portion of net premiums written that were recorded as revenues for the period as the exposure periods expire. net premiums earned for long-duration contracts, typically traditional life contracts, generally are recognized as earned when due from policyholders. net premiums earned increased $1.8 billion, or $2.0 billion on a constant-dollar basis in 2020, comprising 8.9 percent positive growth in commercial p&c lines and 2.5 percent positive growth in consumer lines on a constant-dollar basis. catastrophe losses and prior period development catastrophe losses exclude reinstatement premiums which are additional premiums paid on certain reinsurance agreements in order to reinstate coverage that had been exhausted by loss occurrences. the reinstatement premium amount is typically a pro rata portion of the original ceded premium paid based on how much of the reinsurance limit had been exhausted. prior period development is net of related adjustments which typically relate to either profit commission reserves or policyholder dividend reserves based on actual claim experience that develops after the policy period ends. the expense adjustments correlate to the prior period loss development on these same policies. refer to the non-gaap reconciliation section for further information on reinstatement premiums on catastrophe losses and adjustments to prior period development. we generally define catastrophe loss events consistent with the definition of the property claims service (pcs) for events in the u.s. and canada. pcs defines a catastrophe as an event that causes damage of $25 million or more in insured losses and affects a significant number of insureds. for events outside of the u.s. and canada, we generally use a similar definition. we also define losses from certain pandemics, such as covid-19, as a catastrophe loss. the tables below represent catastrophe loss estimates for events that occurred in the related calendar year only. changes in catastrophe loss estimates in the current calendar year that relate to loss events that occurred in previous calendar years are considered prior period development and are excluded from the tables below. catastrophe loss charge by event for full year 2020 north america commercial p&amp;c insurance north america personal p&amp;c insurance north america agricultural

life insurance financial performance, we use the p&c combined ratio, the loss and loss expense ratio, the policy acquisition cost ratio, and the administrative expense ratio. we calculate these ratios by dividing the respective expense amounts by net premiums earned. we do not calculate these ratios for the life insurance segment as we do not use these measures to monitor or manage that segment. the p&c combined ratio is determined by adding the loss and loss expense ratio, the policy acquisition cost ratio, and the administrative expense ratio. a p&c combined ratio under 100 percent indicates underwriting income, and a combined ratio exceeding 100 percent indicates underwriting loss. 2020 2019 2018 loss and loss expense ratio cay loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses 59.2 %

higher catastrophe losses and lower favorable prior period development. the cay loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses decreased 1.6 percentage points in 2020 principally due to a decrease in the underlying loss ratio reflecting earned rate increases exceeding loss cost trends, better underlying claims experience, and a more average crop loss year in 2020. policy acquisition costs consist of commissions, premium taxes, and certain underwriting costs directly related to the successful acquisition of a new or renewal insurance contract. the policy acquisition cost ratio decreased 0.2 percentage points in 2020 due to a change in the mix of business, including less premiums earned from a&h lines that have a lower acquisition cost ratio, reflecting the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. the administrative expense ratio decreased 0.7 percentage points in 2020 primarily due to lower business expenses from continued expense management control, including during the covid-19 pandemic, lower employee benefit-related expenses and the favorable impact of higher net premiums earned. 52 policy benefits policy benefits represent losses on contracts classified as long-duration and generally include accident and supplemental health products, term and whole life products, endowment products, and annuities. refer to the life insurance segment operating results section for further discussion. policy benefits were $784 million, $740 million and $590 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which included separate account liabilities (gains) losses of $58 million, $44 million and $(38) million, respectively. the offsetting movements of these liabilities are recorded in other (income) expense on the consolidated statements of operations. excluding the separate account gains and losses, policy benefits were $726 million in 2020 compared with $696 million, principally from new business from our expanded presence in chile and growth in asia. refer to the

net premiums written increased $1,099 million, or 8.2 percent in 2020, comprising positive growth of 9.6 percent in commercial p&c lines and negative growth of 13.8 percent in consumer lines. the growth in commercial p&c lines reflects positive rate increases, strong renewal retention and new business written across a number of retail and wholesale lines, including property, financial lines, excess casualty, large risk casualty, and commercial multiple peril. net premiums written in 2020 was depressed by economic contraction resulting from the covid-19 pandemic including $160 million of exposure adjustments on in-force policies, and lower renewal exposures and new business market limitations that impacted several lines of business, including a&h, surety, entertainment, hospitality, retail, and construction. net premiums earned increased $1,042 million, or 8.1 percent in 2020, due to the growth in net premiums written described above. the increase in net premiums earned was adversely impacted by the covid-19 pandemic, including $154 million of exposure adjustments on in-force policies in 2020. combined ratio the loss and loss expense ratio increased 9.0 percentage points in 2020 due principally to higher catastrophe losses, including losses related to covid-19 pandemic claims. the cay loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses decreased 1.1 percentage points in 2020 primarily due to margin improvements coming from earned rate exceeding loss cost trends. the administrative expense ratio decreased 0.7 percentage points in 2020 primarily due to lower business

meaningful losses and loss expenses were primarily from adverse development relating to our brandywine asbestos and environmental exposures, non-a&e run-off casualty exposure, including workers' compensation, and unallocated loss adjustment expenses of the a&e claims operations. losses and loss expenses in 2020 included unfavorable prior period development of $254 million for u.s. child molestation claims, predominantly reviver statute-related. refer to note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for further information. administrative expenses decreased $16 million in 2020, primarily due to lower employee benefit-related expenses, and lower travel-related costs relating to the covid-19 pandemic. refer to the respective sections that follow for a discussion of net realized gains (losses), net investment income, other (income) expense, amortization of purchased intangibles, and income tax expense. net realized and unrealized gains (losses) we take a long-term view with our investment strategy, and our investment managers manage our investment portfolio to maximize total return within certain specific guidelines designed to minimize risk. the majority of our investment portfolio is available for sale and reported at fair value. our held to maturity investment portfolio is reported at amortized cost, net of valuation allowance. the effect of market movements on our fixed maturities portfolio impacts net income (through net realized gains (losses)) when securities are sold, when we write down an asset, or when we record a change to the valuation allowance for expected credit losses. for a further discussion related to how we assess the valuation allowance for expected credit losses and the related impact on net income, refer to note 1 e) to the consolidated financial statements. additionally, net income is impacted through the reporting of changes in the fair value of equity securities, private equity funds where we own less than three percent, and derivatives, including financial futures, options, swaps, and glb reinsurance. changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on available for sale securities, resulting from the revaluation of securities held, changes in cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment, and unrealized postretirement benefit obligations liability adjustment, are reported as separate components of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheets. 61 the following table presents our net realized and unrealized gains (losses): year

postretirement programs of $(232) million, $(76) million, and $(321) million for the years ended december 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. the $2,958 million gain in our investment portfolio was principally a result of narrowing of credit spreads in our corporate bond portfolio and a decline in interest rates, partially offset by $170 million of impairments for securities we intended to sell, and securities written to market entering default. the realized losses relating to the variable annuity reinsurance derivative transactions in 2020 and 2019 reflected an increase in the fair value of glb liabilities due to lower interest rates and changes made to our valuation model relating to policyholder behavior, partially offset by higher global equity markets. included in the realized loss are derivative instruments that decrease in fair value when the s&p 500 index increases. during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, we experienced realized losses of $108 million and $138 million respectively, related to these derivative instruments. effective income tax rate our effective income tax rate was 15.1 percent in both 2020 and 2019 and 14.9 percent in 2018. our effective income tax rate reflects a mix of income or losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates, permanent differences between u.s. gaap and local tax laws, and the impact of discrete items. a change in the geographic mix of earnings could impact our effective tax rate. the effective income tax rate in 2020 was impacted by the higher level of catastrophe losses, principally covid-19, and lower realized losses compared to the prior year. the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act (2017 tax act) included provisions for global intangible low-taxed income (gilti) under which taxes may be imposed on income of u.s.-owned foreign subsidiaries and for a base erosion and anti-abuse tax (beat) under which our u.s. companies could be subject to additional tax as a result, among other things, of certain payments to affiliated non-u.s. companies. there remain substantial uncertainties in the interpretation of gilti and beat and portions of the formal guidance issued to date are still in part in proposed form. finalization of the proposed guidance, and changes to the interpretations and assumptions related to these provisions may impact amounts recorded with respect to the international provisions of the 2017 tax act, which may be material in the period the adjustment is recorded. refer to note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. non-gaap reconciliation in presenting our results, we included and discussed certain non-gaap measures. these non-gaap measures, which may be defined differently by other companies, are important for an understanding of our overall results of operations and financial condition. however, they should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). book value per common share, is shareholders' equity divided by the shares outstanding. tangible book value per common share, is shareholders' equity less goodwill and other intangible assets, net of tax, divided by the shares outstanding. we believe that goodwill and other intangible assets are not indicative of our underlying insurance results or trends and make book value comparisons to less acquisitive peer companies less meaningful. the calculation of tangible book value per share does not consider the embedded goodwill attributable to our investments in partially-owned insurance companies until we attain majority ownership and consolidate. we provide financial measures, including net premiums written, net premiums earned, and underwriting income on a constant-dollar basis. we believe it is useful to evaluate the trends in our results exclusive of the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and the currencies in which our international business is transacted, as these exchange rates could fluctuate significantly between periods and distort the analysis of trends. the impact is determined by assuming constant foreign exchange rates between periods by translating prior period results using the same local currency exchange rates as the comparable current period. p&c performance metrics comprise consolidated operating results (including corporate) and exclude the operating results of the life insurance segment. we believe that these measures are useful and meaningful to investors as they are used by management to assess the company's p&c operations which are the most economically similar. we exclude the life insurance segment because the results of this business do not always correlate with the results of our p&c operations. p&c combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss expense ratio, policy acquisition cost ratio and the administrative expense ratio excluding the life business and including the realized gains and losses on the crop derivatives. these derivatives were purchased to provide economic benefit, in a manner similar to reinsurance protection, in the event that a significant decline in commodity pricing impacts underwriting results. we view gains and losses on these derivatives as part of the results of our underwriting operations. cay p&c combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses (cats) excludes cats and prior period development (ppd) from the p&c combined ratio. we exclude cats as they are not predictable as to timing and amount and ppd as these unexpected loss developments on historical reserves are not indicative of our current underwriting performance. the combined ratio numerator is adjusted to exclude cats, net premiums earned adjustments on ppd, prior period expense adjustments and reinstatement premiums on ppd, and the denominator is adjusted to exclude net premiums earned adjustments on ppd and reinstatement premiums on cats and ppd. in periods where there are adjustments on loss sensitive policies, these adjustments are excluded from ppd and net premiums earned when calculating the ratios. we believe this measure provides a better evaluation of our underwriting performance and enhances the understanding of the trends in our p&c business that may be obscured by these items. this measure is commonly reported among our peer companies and allows for a better comparison. reinstatement premiums are additional premiums paid on certain reinsurance agreements in order to reinstate coverage that had been exhausted by loss occurrences. the reinstatement premium amount is typically a pro rata portion of the original ceded premium paid based on how much of the reinsurance limit had been exhausted. net premiums earned adjustments within ppd are adjustments to the initial premium earned on retrospectively rated policies based on actual claim experience that develops after the policy period ends. the premium adjustments correlate to the prior period loss development on these same policies and are fully earned in the period the adjustments are recorded. prior period expense adjustments typically relate to adjustable commission reserves or policyholder dividend reserves based on actual claim experience that develops after the policy period ends. the expense adjustments correlate to the prior period loss development on these same policies. the following tables present the calculation of combined ratio, as reported for each segment to p&c combined ratio, adjusted for catastrophe losses

acquisition in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. net investment income is influenced by a number of factors including the amounts and timing of inward and outward cash flows, the level of interest rates, and changes in overall asset allocation. net investment income decreased 1.5 percent in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to lower reinvestment rates on new and reinvested assets, partially offset by higher average invested assets, higher dividends on public equities, and an increase in income from corporate bonds called before maturity. refer to note 1 e) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. for private equities where we own less than three percent, investment income is included within net investment income in the table above. for private equities where we own more than three percent, investment income is included within other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. excluded from net investment income is the mark-to-market movement for private equities, which is recorded within either other income (expense) or net realized gains (losses) based on our percentage of ownership. the total mark-to-market

materially based on current market conditions, bond calls, overall duration of the acquired investment portfolio, and foreign exchange. investments our investment portfolio is invested primarily in publicly traded, investment grade, fixed income securities with an average credit quality of a/aa as rated by the independent investment rating services standard and poor's (s&p)/ moody's investors service (moody's). the portfolio is externally managed by independent, professional investment managers and is broadly diversified across geographies, sectors, and issuers. other investments principally comprise direct investments, investment funds, and limited partnerships. we hold no collateralized debt obligations in our investment portfolio, and we provide no credit default protection. we have long-standing global credit limits for our entire portfolio across the organization. exposures are aggregated, monitored, and actively managed by our global credit committee, comprising senior executives, including our chief financial officer, our chief risk officer, our chief investment officer, and our treasurer. we also have well-established, strict contractual investment rules requiring managers to maintain highly diversified exposures to individual issuers and closely monitor investment manager compliance with portfolio guidelines. the average duration of our fixed income securities, including the effect of options and swaps, was 4.0 years and 3.8 years at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. we estimate that a 100 basis point (bps) increase in interest rates would reduce the valuation of our fixed income portfolio by approximately $4.3 billion at december 31, 2020. we established credit loss valuation allowances as a result of our adoption of guidance on financial instruments - credit losses: measurement of credit losses on financial instruments (cecl) on january 1, 2020. the covid-19 global pandemic and related economic conditions adversely impacted our investment portfolio in the first half of the year. this adverse impact was mitigated by the overall high credit quality of the portfolio and the stabilization of the valuation of securities due to measures announced by the u.s. federal reserve, including programs to support corporate and asset backed securities. overall, the valuation allowance decreased in 2020. refer to notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on expected credit losses. the following table shows the fair value and cost/amortized cost, net of valuation

bonds and essential service revenue bonds including education and utilities (water, power, and sewers). non-u.s. our exposure to the euro results primarily from chubb european group se which is headquartered in france and offers a broad range of coverages throughout the european union, central, and eastern europe. chubb primarily invests in euro denominated investments to support its local currency insurance obligations and required capital levels. chubb's local currency investment portfolios have strict contractual investment guidelines requiring managers to maintain a high quality and diversified portfolio to both sector and individual issuers. investment portfolios are monitored daily to ensure investment manager compliance with portfolio guidelines. our non-u.s. investment grade fixed income portfolios are currency-matched with the insurance liabilities of our non-u.s. operations. the average credit quality of our non-u.s. fixed income securities is a and 48 percent of our holdings are rated aaa or guaranteed by governments or quasi-government agencies. within the context of these investment portfolios, our government and corporate bond holdings are highly diversified across industries and geographies. issuer limits are based on credit rating (aa-two percent, a-one percent, bbb-0.5 percent of the total portfolio) and are monitored daily via an internal compliance system. we manage our indirect exposure using the same credit rating based investment approach. accordingly, we do not believe our indirect exposure is material. 70 the following table summarizes the

below-investment grade corporate fixed income portfolio below-investment grade securities have different characteristics than investment grade corporate debt securities. risk of loss from default by the borrower is greater with below-investment grade securities. below-investment grade securities are generally unsecured and are often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer. also, issuers of below-investment grade securities usually have higher levels of debt and are more sensitive to adverse economic conditions, such as recession or increasing interest rates, than investment grade issuers. at december 31, 2020, our corporate fixed income investment portfolio included below-investment grade and non-rated securities which, in total, comprised approximately 15 percent of our fixed income portfolio. our below-investment grade and non-rated portfolio includes over 1,400 issuers, with the greatest single exposure being $176 million. we manage high-yield bonds as a distinct and separate asset class from investment grade bonds. the allocation to high-yield bonds is explicitly set by internal management and is targeted to securities in the upper tier of credit quality (bb/b). our minimum rating for initial purchase is bb/b. fourteen external investment managers are responsible for high-yield security selection and portfolio construction. our high-yield managers have a conservative approach to credit selection and very low historical default experience. holdings are highly diversified across industries and generally subject to a 1.5 percent issuer limit as a percentage of high-yield allocation. we monitor position limits daily through an internal compliance system. derivative and structured securities (e.g., credit default swaps and collateralized loan obligations) are not permitted in the high-yield portfolio. asbestos and environmental (a&e) asbestos and environmental (a&e) reserving considerations for asbestos, chubb faces claims relating to policies issued to manufacturers, distributors, installers, and other parties in the chain of commerce for asbestos and products containing asbestos. claimants will generally allege damages across an extended time period which may coincide with multiple policies covering a wide range of time periods for a single insured. environmental claims present exposure for remediation and defense costs associated with the contamination of property as a result of pollution. the following table presents count information for asbestos claims by causative agent and environmental claims by account, for direct policies only: asbestos (by causative agent) environmental (by account) 2020 2019 2020 2019 open at beginning of year 1,724 1,838 1,217 1,361 newly reported/reopened 192 173 130 140 closed or

(alae) reserves by the average asbestos or environmental loss and alae payments for the three most recent calendar years (3-year survival ratio). the 3-year survival ratios for gross and net asbestos loss and alae reserves were 5.9 years and 6.3 years, respectively. the 3-year survival ratios for gross and net environmental loss and alae reserves were 4.9 years and 25.5 years, respectively. the net 3-year survival ratios were impacted by favorable reinsurance settlements in 2018. excluding the settlements, the 3-year survival ratio for net asbestos loss and alae reserves and net environmental loss and alae reserves were 6.0 years and 5.2 years, respectively. the survival ratios provide only a very rough depiction of reserves and are significantly impacted by a number of factors such as aggressive settlement practices, variations in gross to ceded relationships within the asbestos or environmental claims, and levels of coverage provided. therefore, we urge caution in using these very simplistic ratios to gauge reserve adequacy. 72 catastrophe management we actively monitor and manage our catastrophe risk accumulation around the world, including setting risk limits based on probable maximum loss (pml) and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance. the table below presents our modeled pre-tax estimates of natural catastrophe pml, net of reinsurance, at december 31, 2020, for worldwide, u.s. hurricane and california earthquake events, based on our in-force portfolio at october 1, 2020 and reflecting the april 1, 2020 reinsurance program (see natural catastrophe property reinsurance program section) as well as inuring reinsurance protection coverages. according to the model, for the 1-in-100 return period scenario, there is a one percent chance that our pre-tax annual aggregate losses incurred in any year from u.s. hurricane events could be in excess of $2,725 million (or 4.6 percent of our total shareholders' equity at december 31, 2020). these estimates assume that reinsurance recoverable is fully collectible. modeled net probable maximum loss (pml) pre-tax worldwide (1) u.s. hurricane (2) california earthquake (3) annual aggregate annual

from hurricanes, typhoons, convective storms and earthquakes and do not include \"non-modeled\" perils such as wildfire and flood. (2) u.s. hurricane losses include losses from wind and storm-surge and exclude rainfall. (3) california earthquakes include fire-following perils. the above estimates of chubb's loss profile are inherently uncertain for many reasons, including the following: •while the use of third-party catastrophe modeling packages to simulate potential hurricane and earthquake losses is prevalent within the insurance industry, the models are reliant upon significant meteorology, seismology, and engineering assumptions to estimate catastrophe losses. in particular, modeled catastrophe events are not always a representation of actual events and ensuing additional loss potential; •there is no universal standard in the preparation of insured data for use in the models, the running of the modeling software and interpretation of loss output. these loss estimates do not represent our potential maximum exposures and it is highly likely that our actual incurred losses would vary materially from the modeled estimates; •the potential effects of climate change add to modeling complexity; and •changing climate conditions could impact our exposure to natural catastrophe risks, including u.s. hurricane. published studies by leading government, academic and professional organizations predict an increase in the expected annual frequency of atlantic-basin hurricanes and sea level rise through the end of the century over observed historical averages. these studies contemplate expected multi-decadal impacts of climate change on sea surface temperatures, sea levels and other factors contributing to the frequency and intensity of hurricanes. based on preliminary stress tests conducted against the chubb portfolio, the impacts of climate change are not expected to materially impact our reported u.s. hurricane pml over the next 12 months. these tests reflect current exposures only and excludes potential mitigating factors, such as changes to building codes, public or private risk mitigation, regulation and public policy. natural catastrophe property reinsurance program chubb's core property catastrophe reinsurance program provides protection against natural catastrophes impacting its primary property operations (i.e., excluding our global reinsurance and life insurance segments). we regularly review our reinsurance protection and corresponding property catastrophe exposures. this may or may not lead to the purchase of additional reinsurance prior to a program's renewal date. in addition, prior to each renewal date, we consider how much, if any, coverage we intend to buy and we may make material changes to the current structure in light of various factors, including modeled pml assessment at various return periods, reinsurance pricing, our risk tolerance and exposures, and various other structuring considerations. chubb renewed its global property catastrophe reinsurance program for our north american and international operations effective april 1, 2020 through march 31, 2021, with no material changes in coverage from the expiring program. the program consists of three layers in excess of losses retained by chubb on a per occurrence basis. in addition, chubb also renewed its terrorism coverage (excluding nuclear, biological, chemical and radiation coverage, with an inclusion of coverage for biological and chemical coverage for personal lines) for the united states from april 1, 2020 through march 31, 2021 with the same limits and retention and percentage placed except that the majority of terrorism coverage is on an aggregate basis above our retentions without a reinstatement. loss location layer of loss comments notes united states $0 million - $1.0 billion losses retained by chubb (a) (excluding alaska and hawaii) united states $1.0 billion -$1.15 billion all natural perils and terrorism (b) (excluding alaska and hawaii) united states $1.15 billion -$2.15 billion all natural perils and terrorism (c) (excluding alaska and hawaii) united states $2.15 billion -$3.5 billion all natural perils and terrorism (d) (excluding alaska and hawaii) international $0 million -$175 million losses retained by chubb (a) (including alaska and hawaii) international $175 million -$1.175 billion all natural perils and terrorism (c) (including alaska and hawaii) alaska, hawaii, and canada $1.175 billion - $2.525 billion all natural perils and terrorism (d) (a) ultimate retention will depend upon the nature of the loss and the interplay between the underlying per risk programs and certain other catastrophe programs purchased by individual business units. these other catastrophe programs have the potential to reduce our effective retention below the stated levels. (b) these coverages are partially placed with reinsurers. (c) these coverages are both part of the same second layer within the global catastrophe program and are fully placed with reinsurers. (d) these coverages are both part of the same third layer within the global catastrophe program and are fully placed with reinsurers. political risk and credit insurance political risk insurance is a specialized coverage that provides clients with protection against unexpected, catastrophic political or macroeconomic events, primarily in emerging markets. we participate in this market through our bermuda based wholly-owned subsidiary sovereign risk insurance ltd. (sovereign), and through a unit of our london-based cgm operation. chubb is one of the world's leading underwriters of political risk and credit insurance, has a global portfolio spread across more than 150 countries and is also a member of the berne union. our clients include financial institutions, national export credit agencies, leading multilateral agencies, private equity firms and multinational corporations. cgm writes political risk and credit insurance business out of underwriting offices in london, united kingdom; hamburg, germany; sao paulo, brazil; singapore; tokyo, japan; and in the u.s. in the following locations: chicago, new york, los angeles and washington, d.c. our political risk insurance products provide protection to commercial lenders against defaults on cross border loans, covers investors against equity losses, and protects exporters against defaults on contracts. commercial lenders, our largest client segment, are covered for missed scheduled loan repayments due to acts of confiscation, expropriation or nationalization by the host government, currency inconvertibility or exchange transfer restrictions, or war or other acts of political violence. in addition, in the case of loans to government-owned entities or loans that have a government guarantee, political risk policies cover scheduled payments against risks of non-payment or non-honoring of government guarantees. private equity investors and corporations cover their equity investments against financial losses, such as expropriatory events, inability to repatriate dividends, and physical damage to their operations caused by covered political risk events. our export contracts product provides coverage for both exporters and their financing banks against the risk of contract frustration due to government actions, including non-payment by governmental entities. cgm's credit insurance businesses cover losses due to insolvency, protracted default, and political risk perils including export and license cancellation. our credit insurance product provides coverage to larger companies that have sophisticated credit risk management systems, with exposure to multiple customers and that have the ability to self-insure losses up to a certain level through excess of loss coverage. it also provides coverage to trade finance banks, exporters, and trading companies, with exposure to trade-related financing instruments. cgm also has limited capacity for specialist credit insurance products which provide coverage for project finance and working capital loans for large corporations and banks. we have implemented structural features in our policies in order to control potential losses within the political risk and credit insurance businesses. these include basic loss sharing features such as co-insurance and deductibles, and in the case of trade credit, the use of non-qualifying losses that drop smaller exposures deemed too difficult to assess. ultimate loss severity is also limited by using waiting periods to enable the insurer and insured to mitigate losses and to agree on recovery strategies if a claim does materialize. we have the option to pay claims over the original loan repayment schedule, rather than in a lump sum, in order to provide insureds and the insurer additional time to remedy problems and work towards full recoveries. it is important to note that political risk and credit policies are named peril conditional insurance contracts, not financial guarantees, and claims are only paid after conditions and warranties are fulfilled. political risk and credit insurance policies do not cover currency devaluations, bond defaults, movements in overseas equity markets, transactions deemed illegal, situations where corruption or misrepresentation has occurred, or debt that is not legally enforceable. in addition to assessing and mitigating potential exposure on a policy-by-policy basis, we also have specific risk management measures in place to manage overall exposure and risk. these measures include placing country, credit, and individual transaction limits based on country risk and credit ratings, combined single loss limits on multi-country policies, the use of quota share and excess of loss reinsurance protection as well as quarterly modeling and stress-testing of the portfolio. we have a dedicated country and credit risk management team that are responsible for the portfolio. crop insurance we are, and have been since the 1980s, one of the leading writers of crop insurance in the u.s. and have conducted that business through a managing general agent subsidiary of rain and hail. we provide protection throughout the u.s. on a variety of crops and are therefore geographically diversified, which reduces the risk of exposure to a single event or a heavy accumulation of losses in any one region. our crop insurance business comprises two components - multiple peril crop insurance (mpci) and crop-hail insurance. the mpci program, offered in conjunction with the u.s. department of agriculture's risk management agency (rma), is a federal subsidized insurance program that covers revenue shortfalls or production losses due to natural causes such as drought, excessive moisture, hail, wind, freeze, insects, and disease. these revenue products are defined as providing both commodity price and yield coverages. policies are available for various crops in different areas of the u.s. and generally have deductibles generally ranging from 10 percent to 50 percent of the insured's risk. the usda's risk management agency (rma) sets the policy terms and conditions, rates and forms, and is also responsible for setting compliance standards. as a participant in the mpci program, we report all details of policies to the rma and are party to a standard reinsurance agreement (sra). the sra sets out the relationship between private insurance companies and the federal crop insurance corporation (fcic) concerning the terms and conditions regarding the risks each will bear including the pro-rata and state stop-loss provisions, which allows companies to limit the exposure of any one state or group of states on their underwriting results. in addition to the pro-rata and excess of loss reinsurance protections inherent in the sra, we also purchase third-party proportional and stop-loss reinsurance for our mpci business to reduce our exposure. we may also enter into crop derivative contracts to further manage our risk exposure. each year the rma issues a final sra for the subsequent reinsurance year (i.e., the 2021 sra covers the 2021 reinsurance year from july 1, 2020 through june 30, 2021). there were no significant changes in the terms and conditions from the 2020 sra and therefore, the new sra does not impact chubb's outlook on the crop program relative to 2021. we recognize net premiums written as soon as estimable on our mpci business, which is generally when we receive acreage reports from the policyholders on the various crops throughout the u.s. this allows us to best determine the premium associated with the liability that is being planted. the mpci program has specific timeframes as to when producers must report acreage to us and in certain cases, the reporting occurs after the close of the respective reinsurance year. once the net premium written has been recorded, the premium is then earned over the growing season for the crops. a majority of the crops that are covered in the program are typically subject to the sra in effect at the beginning of the year. given the major crops covered in the program, we typically see a substantial written and earned premium impact in the second and third quarters. the pricing of mpci premium is determined using a number of factors including commodity prices and related volatility (i.e., both impact the amount of premium we can charge to the policyholder). for example, in most states, the pricing for the mpci revenue product for corn (i.e., insurance coverage for lower than expected crop revenue in a given season) includes a factor based on the average commodity price in february. if corn commodity prices are higher in february, compared to the february price in the prior year, and all other factors are the same, the increase in price will increase the corn premium year-over-year. pricing is also impacted by volatility factors, which measure the likelihood commodity prices will fluctuate over the crop year. for example, if volatility is set at a higher rate compared to the prior year, and all other factors are the same, the premium charged to the policyholder will be higher year-over-year for the same level of coverage. losses incurred on the mpci business are determined using both commodity price and crop yield. with respect to commodity price, there are two important periods on a large portion of the business: the month of february when the initial premium base is set, and the month of october when the final harvest price is set. if the price declines from february to october, with yield remaining at normal levels, the policyholder may be eligible to recover on the policy. however, in most cases there are deductibles on these policies, therefore, the impact of a decline in price would have to exceed the deductible before a policyholder would be eligible to recover. we evaluate our mpci business at an aggregate level and the combination of all of our insured crops (both winter and summer) go into our underwriting gain or loss estimate in any given year. typically, we do not have enough information on the harvest prices or crop yield outputs to quantify the preliminary estimated impact to our underwriting results until the fourth quarter. our crop-hail program is a private offering. premium is earned on the crop-hail program over the coverage period of the policy. given the very short nature of the growing season, most crop-hail business is typically written in the second and third quarters and the recognition of earned premium is also more heavily concentrated during this timeframe. we use industry data to develop our own rates and forms for the coverage offered. the policy primarily protects farmers against yield reduction caused by hail and/or fire, and related costs such as transit to storage. we offer various deductibles to allow the grower to partially self-insure for a reduced premium cost. we limit our crop-hail exposures through the use of township liability limits and third-party reinsurance on our net retained hail business. liquidity liquidity is a measure of a company's ability to generate cash flows sufficient to meet short-term and long-term cash requirements. as a holding company, chubb limited possesses assets that consist primarily of the stock of its subsidiaries and other investments. in addition to net investment income, chubb limited's cash flows depend primarily on dividends and other statutorily permissible payments. historically, dividends and other statutorily permitted payments have come primarily from chubb's bermuda-based operating subsidiaries, which we refer to as our bermuda subsidiaries. our consolidated sources of funds consist primarily of net premiums written, fees, net investment income, and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. funds are used at our various companies primarily to pay claims, operating expenses, and dividends; to service debt; to purchase investments; and to fund acquisitions. we anticipate that positive cash flows from operations (underwriting activities and investment income) should be sufficient to cover cash outflows under most loss scenarios for the near term. should the need arise, we generally have access to capital markets and available credit facilities. refer to \"credit facilities\" below for additional information. our access to funds under the existing credit facility is dependent on the ability of the bank that is a party to the facility to meet its funding commitments. should our existing credit provider experience financial difficulty, we may be required to replace credit sources, possibly in a difficult market. if we cannot obtain adequate capital or sources of credit on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. to date, we have not experienced difficulty accessing our credit facility. to further ensure the sufficiency of funds to settle unforeseen claims, we hold certain invested assets in cash and short-term investments. in addition, for certain insurance, reinsurance, or deposit contracts that tend to have relatively large and reasonably predictable cash outflows, we attempt to establish dedicated portfolios of assets that are duration-matched with the related liabilities. with respect to the duration of our overall investment portfolio, we manage asset durations to both maximize return given current market conditions and provide sufficient liquidity to cover future loss payments. at december 31, 2020, the average duration of our fixed maturities (4.0 years) is less than the average expected duration of our insurance liabilities (4.7 years). despite our safeguards, if paid losses accelerate beyond our ability to fund such paid losses from current operating cash flows, we might need to either liquidate a portion of our investment portfolio or arrange for financing. potential events causing such a liquidity strain could include several significant catastrophes occurring in a relatively short period of time, large uncollectible reinsurance recoverables on paid losses (as a result of coverage disputes, reinsurers' credit problems, or decreases in the value of collateral supporting reinsurance recoverables) or increases in collateral postings under our variable annuity reinsurance business. because each subsidiary focuses on a more limited number of specific product lines than is collectively available from the chubb group of companies, the mix of business tends to be less diverse at the subsidiary level. as a result, the probability of a liquidity strain, as described above, may be greater for individual subsidiaries than when liquidity is assessed on a consolidated basis. if such a liquidity strain were to occur in a subsidiary, we could be required to liquidate a portion of our investments, potentially at distressed prices, as well as be required to contribute capital to the particular subsidiary and/or curtail dividends from the subsidiary to support holding company operations. the payment of dividends or other statutorily permissible distributions from our operating companies are subject to the laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction, as well as the need to maintain capital levels adequate to support the insurance and reinsurance operations, including financial strength ratings issued by independent rating agencies. during 2020, we were able to meet all our obligations, including the payments of dividends on our common shares, with our net cash flows. we assess which subsidiaries to draw dividends from based on a number of factors. considerations such as regulatory and legal restrictions as well as the subsidiary's financial condition are paramount to the dividend decision. chubb limited received dividends of $1.9 billion and $200 million from its bermuda subsidiaries in 2020 and 2019, respectively. chubb limited also received cash dividends of $110 million and non-cash dividends of $734 million from a swiss subsidiary in 2020. there were no dividends received in 2019. the payment of any dividends from cgm or its subsidiaries is subject to applicable u.k. insurance laws and regulations. in addition, the release of funds by syndicate 2488 to subsidiaries of cgm is subject to regulations promulgated by the society of lloyd's. chubb limited received no dividends from cgm in 2020 and 2019. the u.s. insurance subsidiaries of chubb ina holdings inc. (chubb ina) may pay dividends, without prior regulatory approval, subject to restrictions set out in state law of the subsidiary's domicile (or, if applicable, commercial domicile). chubb ina's international subsidiaries are also subject to insurance laws and regulations particular to the countries in which the subsidiaries operate. these laws and regulations sometimes include restrictions that limit the amount of dividends payable without prior approval of regulatory insurance authorities. chubb limited received no dividends from chubb ina in 2020 and 2019. debt issued by chubb ina is serviced by statutorily permissible distributions by chubb ina's insurance subsidiaries to chubb ina as well as other group resources. chubb ina received dividends of $1.2 billion and $3.7 billion from its subsidiaries in 2020 and 2019, respectively. at december 31, 2020, the amount of dividends available to be paid to chubb ina in 2021 from its subsidiaries without prior approval of insurance regulatory authorities totals $2.7 billion. cash flows our insurance and reinsurance operations provide liquidity in that premiums are received in advance, sometimes substantially in advance, of the time claims are paid. generally, cash flows are affected by claim payments that, due to the nature of our operations, may comprise large loss payments on a limited number of claims and which can fluctuate significantly from period to period. the irregular timing of these loss payments can create significant variations in cash flows from operations between periods. refer to \"contractual obligations and commitments\" for our estimate of future claim payments by period. sources of liquidity include cash from operations, routine sales of investments, and financing arrangements. the following is a discussion of our cash flows for 2020, 2019, and 2018. operating cash flows reflect net income for each period, adjusted for non-cash items and changes in working capital. operating cash flows were $9.8 billion in 2020, compared to $6.3 billion and $5.5 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively. operating cash flow increased $3.5 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, principally reflecting higher premiums collected and reduced payment activity due to the economic slowdown related to covid-19 pandemic. cash used for investing was $7.5 billion in 2020, compared to $5.9 billion and $2.9 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively. the current year included payment, including a deposit, of $1.6 billion for the purchase of an additional 16.2 percent ownership in huatai group. this compares to the prior year purchase of an additional 10.9 percent ownership interest in huatai group for $580 million. refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. in addition, the current year included higher private equity contributions, net of distributions received, of $1.1 billion. cash used for financing was $2.1 billion in 2020, compared to $151 million and $2.0 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively. cash used for financing was higher by $1.9 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt (net of repayments) of $2.6 billion, partially offset by fewer shares repurchased in the current year. refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on share repurchases. both internal and external forces influence our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. claim settlements, premium levels, and investment returns may be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions. in many cases, significant periods of time, ranging up to several years or more, may lapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us, and the settlement of the liability for that loss. we use repurchase agreements as a low-cost funding alternative. at december 31, 2020, there were $1.4 billion in repurchase agreements outstanding with various maturities over the next eight months. in addition to cash from operations, routine sales of investments, and financing arrangements, we have agreements with a third-party bank provider which implemented two international multi-currency notional cash pooling programs to enhance cash management efficiency during periods of short-term timing mismatches between expected inflows and outflows of cash by currency. the programs allow us to optimize investment income by avoiding portfolio disruption. in each program, participating chubb entities establish deposit accounts in different currencies with the bank provider. each day the credit or debit balances in every account are notionally translated into a single currency (u.s. dollars) and then notionally pooled. the bank extends overdraft credit to all participating chubb entities as needed, provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in each pool at the end of each day is at least zero. actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between legal entities. chubb entities may incur overdraft balances as a means to address short-term liquidity needs. any overdraft balances incurred under this program by a chubb entity would be guaranteed by chubb limited (up to $300 million in the aggregate). our syndicated letter of credit facility allows for same day drawings to fund a net pool overdraft should participating chubb entities withdraw contributed funds from the pool. capital resources capital resources consist of funds deployed or available to be deployed to support our business operations. december 31 december 31 (in millions of u.s. dollars, except for percentages) 2020 2019 short-term debt $-

above and are disclosed separately from short-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets. the repurchase agreements are collateralized borrowings where we maintain the right and ability to redeem the collateral on short notice, unlike short-term debt which comprises the current maturities of our long-term debt instruments. on september 17, 2020, chubb ina issued $1.0 billion of 1.375 percent senior notes due september 2030. chubb ina's $1.3 billion of 2.3 percent senior notes due november 2020 was paid upon maturity. refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for details about the debt issued and debt redeemed. we believe our financial strength provides us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain available funds externally through debt or equity financing on both a short-term and long-term basis. our ability to access the capital markets is dependent on, among other things, market conditions and our perceived financial strength. we have accessed both the debt and equity markets from time to time. we generally maintain the ability to issue certain classes of debt and equity securities via an unlimited securities and exchange commission (sec) shelf registration which is renewed every three years. this allows us capital market access for refinancing as well as for unforeseen or opportunistic capital needs. in october 2018, we filed an unlimited shelf registration which allows us to issue certain classes of debt and equity. this shelf registration expires in october 2021. securities repurchases from time to time, we repurchase shares as part of our capital management program. the board of directors (board) has authorized share repurchase programs as follows: •$1.0 billion of chubb common shares from january 1, 2018 through december 31, 2018 •$1.5 billion of chubb common shares from december 1, 2018 through december 31, 2019 •$1.5 billion of chubb common shares from november 21, 2019 through december 31, 2020 •$1.5 billion of chubb common shares from november 19, 2020 through december 31, 2021 subsequently, in february 2021, the board approved an increase to the november 2020 share repurchase program of $1.0 billion to a total of $2.5 billion, effective through december 31, 2021. share repurchases may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, block trades, accelerated repurchases and/or through option or other forward transactions. in 2020, 2019, and 2018 we repurchased $516 million, $1.53 billion, and $1.02 billion, respectively, of common shares in a series of open market transactions under the board share repurchase authorizations. on april 22, 2020, we suspended share repurchases, given the economic environment and to preserve capital for both risk and opportunity. subsequently we announced and then resumed share repurchases on october 29, 2020. the $1.5 billion november 2019 authorization remained effective through december 31, 2020. repurchases through december 31, 2020 were made under this authorization. for the period january 1 through february 24, 2021, we repurchased 1,971,000 common shares for a total of $327 million in a series of open market transactions under the share repurchase program authorized in november 2020. at february 24, 2021, $2.17 billion in share repurchase authorization remained through december 31, 2021. common shares our common shares had a par value of chf 24.15 each at december 31, 2020. as of december 31, 2020, there were 26,872,639 common shares in treasury with a weighted average cost of $135.58 per share. under swiss law, dividends must be stated in swiss francs though dividend payments are made by chubb in u.s. dollars. at our may 2019 annual general meeting, our shareholders approved an annual dividend for the following year of up to $3.00 per share, which was paid in four quarterly installments of $0.75 per share at dates determined by the board after the annual general meeting by way of distribution from capital contribution reserves, transferred to free reserves for payment. at our may 2020 annual general meeting, our shareholders approved an annual dividend for the following year of up to $3.12 per share, expected to be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.78 per share after the annual general meeting by way of distribution from capital contribution reserves, transferred to free reserves for payment. the board will determine the record and payment dates at which the annual dividend may be paid until the date of the 2021 annual general meeting, and is authorized to abstain from distributing a dividend at its discretion. the first three quarterly installments each of $0.78 per share, have been distributed by the board as expected. dividend distributions on common shares amounted to chf 2.89 ($3.09) per share for the year ended december 31, 2020. refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our dividends. contractual

consolidated financial statements. (2)primarily comprises agreements with vendors to purchase system software administration and maintenance services, and audit fees. (3)funding commitment primarily related to limited partnerships. the timing of the payments of these commitments is uncertain and may differ from the estimated timing in the table. (4)subject to foreign exchange fluctuations on interest expense and principal. the contractual obligations and commitments table excludes the following items: •pension obligations: minimum funding requirements for our pension obligations are immaterial. subsequent funding commitments are apt to vary due to many factors and are difficult to estimate at this time. refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. •liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits: the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and offsetting tax credits, was $76 million at december 31, 2020. at december 31, 2020, we had accrued $16 million in liabilities for income tax-related interest and penalties in our consolidated balance sheet. other than settlement of a liability in january 2021 for $23 million, including interest, we are unable to make a reliable estimate for the timing of cash settlement of these liabilities. refer to note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. we have no other significant contractual obligations or commitments not reflected in the table above. we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. estimated gross loss payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts we are obligated to pay claims under insurance and reinsurance contracts for specified loss events covered under those contracts. such loss payments represent our most significant future payment obligation as a p&c insurance and reinsurance company. in contrast to other contractual obligations, cash payments are not determinable from the terms specified within the contract. for example, we do not ultimately make a payment to our counterparty for many insurance and reinsurance contracts (i.e., when a loss event has not occurred) and if a payment is to be made, the amount and timing cannot be determined from the contract. in the table above, we estimate payments by period relating to our gross liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses included in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2020, and do not take into account reinsurance recoverable. these estimated loss payments are inherently uncertain and the amount and timing of actual loss payments are likely to differ from these estimates and the differences could be material. given the numerous factors and assumptions involved in both estimates of loss and loss expense reserves and related estimates as to the timing of future loss and loss expense payments in the table above, differences between actual and estimated loss payments will not necessarily indicate a commensurate change in ultimate loss estimates. the liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses presented in our balance sheet is discounted for certain structured settlements, for which the timing and amount of future claim payments are reliably determinable, and certain reserves for unsettled claims. our loss reserves are not discounted for the time value of money. accordingly, the estimated amounts in the table exceed the liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses presented in our balance sheet. refer to note 1 h) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. estimated payments for future policy benefits we establish reserves for future policy benefits for life, long-term health, and annuity contracts. the amounts in the table are gross of fees or premiums due from the underlying contracts. the liability for future policy benefits for life, long-term health, and annuity contracts presented in our balance sheet is discounted and reflected net of fees or premiums due from the underlying contracts. accordingly, the estimated amounts in the table exceed the liability for future policy benefits presented in our balance sheet. payment amounts related to these reserves must be estimated and are not determinable from the contract. due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing and amount of these payments, actual results could materially differ from the estimates in the table. credit facilities as our bermuda subsidiaries are non-admitted insurers and reinsurers in the u.s., the terms of certain u.s. insurance and reinsurance contracts require them to provide collateral, which can be in the form of letters of credit (locs). locs may also be used for general corporate purposes. should the need arise, we generally have access to capital markets and to credit facilities with letter of credit capacity of $4.0 billion with a sub-limit of $1.9 billion for revolving credit. at december 31, 2020, our usage under these facilities was $1.7 billion in locs, of which $1.1 billion related to our variable annuity reinsurance program. our access to credit under these facilities is dependent on the ability of the banks that are a party to the facilities to meet their funding commitments. should the existing credit providers on these facilities experience financial difficulty, we may be required to replace credit sources, possibly in a difficult market. if we cannot obtain adequate capital or sources of credit on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. to date, we have not experienced difficulty accessing our credit facilities or establishing additional facilities when needed. in the event we are required to provide alternative security to clients, the security could take the form of additional insurance trusts supported by our investment portfolio or funds withheld using our cash resources. the value of locs required is driven by, among other things, statutory liabilities reported by variable annuity guarantee reinsurance clients, loss development of existing reserves, the payment pattern of such reserves, the expansion of business, and loss experience of such business. the facilities noted above require that we maintain certain financial covenants, all of which have been met at december 31, 2020. these covenants include: (i)a minimum consolidated net worth of not less than $34.985 billion; and (ii)a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization of not greater than 0.35 to 1. at december 31, 2020, (a) the minimum consolidated net worth requirement under the covenant described in (i) above was $34.985 billion and our actual consolidated net worth as calculated under that covenant was $56.6 billion and (b) our ratio of debt to total capitalization, as calculated under the covenant which excludes the fair value adjustment of debt acquired through the chubb corp acquisition, was 0.20 to 1, which is below the maximum debt to total capitalization ratio of 0.35 to 1 as described in (ii) above. our failure to comply with the covenants under any credit facility would, subject to grace periods in the case of certain covenants, result in an event of default. this could require us to repay any outstanding borrowings or to cash collateralize locs under such facility. our failure to repay material financial obligations, as well as our failure with respect to certain other events expressly identified, would result in an event of default under the facility. ratings chubb limited and its subsidiaries are assigned credit and financial strength (insurance) ratings from internationally recognized rating agencies, including s&p, a.m. best, moody's, and fitch. the ratings issued on our companies by these agencies are announced publicly and are available directly from the agencies. our internet site (investors.chubb.com, under shareholder resources/rating agency ratings) also contains some information about our ratings, but such information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this report. financial strength ratings reflect the rating agencies' opinions of a company's claims paying ability. independent ratings are one of the important factors that establish our competitive position in the insurance markets. the rating agencies consider many factors in determining the financial strength rating of an insurance company, including the relative level of statutory surplus necessary to support the business operations of the company. these ratings are based upon factors relevant to policyholders, agents, and intermediaries and are not directed toward the protection of investors. such ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities. credit ratings assess a company's ability to make timely payments of principal and interest on its debt. it is possible that, in the future, one or more of the rating agencies may reduce our existing ratings. if one or more of our ratings were downgraded, we could incur higher borrowing costs, and our ability to access the capital markets could be impacted. in addition, our insurance and reinsurance operations could be adversely impacted by a downgrade in our financial strength ratings, including a possible reduction in demand for our products in certain markets. also, we have insurance and reinsurance contracts which contain rating triggers. in the event the s&p or a.m. best financial strength ratings of chubb fall, we may be faced with the cancellation of premium or be required to post collateral on our underlying obligation associated with this premium. we estimate that at december 31, 2020, a one-notch downgrade of our s&p or a.m. best financial strength ratings would result in an immaterial loss of premium or requirement for collateral to be posted.\"\"\"\n\n    Instruction:\n    Identify and summarize all

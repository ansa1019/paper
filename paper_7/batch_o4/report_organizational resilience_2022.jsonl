(gaap), are determined using best estimates and assumptions. while we believe that the amounts included in our consolidated financial statements reflect our best judgment, actual amounts could ultimately materially differ from those currently presented. we believe the items that require the most subjective and complex estimates are: •unpaid loss and loss expense reserves, including long-tail asbestos and environmental (a&e) reserves and non-a&e casualty exposures; •future policy benefits reserves; •the valuation of value of business acquired (voba) and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and voba; •the assessment of risk transfer for certain structured insurance and reinsurance contracts; •reinsurance recoverable, including a valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance; •the valuation of our investment portfolio and assessment of valuation allowance for expected credit losses; •the valuation of deferred income taxes; and •the assessment of goodwill for impairment. effective january 1, 2023, chubb adopted the long-duration targeted improvement (ldti) u.s. gaap accounting guidance which affects the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure requirements for long-duration contracts. therefore, the assumptions and methods used for future policy benefit reserves, voba, and deferred policy acquisition costs will be changed to reflect this new accounting guidance. refer to note 1 t) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. we believe our accounting policies for these items are of critical importance to our consolidated financial statements. the following discussion provides more information regarding the estimates and assumptions required to arrive at these amounts and should be read in conjunction with the sections entitled: prior period development, asbestos and environmental (a&e), reinsurance recoverable on ceded reinsurance, investments, and net realized and unrealized gains (losses). unpaid losses and loss expenses as an insurance and reinsurance company, we are required by applicable laws and regulations and gaap to establish loss and loss expense reserves for the estimated unpaid portion of the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses under the terms of our policies and agreements with our insured and reinsured customers. at december 31, 2022, our gross unpaid loss and loss expense reserves were $76.3 billion and our net unpaid loss and loss expense reserves were $59.2 billion. with the exception of certain structured settlements, for which the timing and amount of future claim payments are reliably determinable, and certain reserves for unsettled claims, our loss reserves are not discounted for the time value of money. the net undiscounted reserves related to structured settlements and certain reserves for unsettled claims are immaterial. the following table presents a roll-forward of our unpaid losses and loss expenses: december 31, 2022 december 31, 2021 (in millions of u.s. dollars) gross losses reinsurance recoverable (1) net losses gross losses reinsurance recoverable (1) net losses balance, beginning of year $72,943 $16,184

reinsurance. the estimate of the liabilities includes provisions for claims that have been reported but are unpaid at the balance sheet date (case reserves) and for obligations on claims that have been incurred but not reported (ibnr) at the balance sheet date. ibnr may also include provisions to account for the possibility that reported claims may settle for amounts that differ from the established case reserves. loss reserves also include an estimate of expenses associated with processing and settling unpaid claims (loss expenses). our loss reserves comprise approximately 78 percent casualty-related business, which typically encompasses long-tail risks, and other risks where a high degree of judgment is required. the process of establishing loss reserves for property and casualty claims can be complex and is subject to considerable uncertainty as it requires the use of informed estimates and judgments based on circumstances underlying the insured losses known at the date of accrual. for example, the reserves established for high excess casualty claims, asbestos and environmental claims, claims from major catastrophic events, or for our various product lines each require different assumptions and judgments to be made. the impact of covid on both underlying exposures and the legal and claim adjudication processes adds an additional layer of complexity. the effects of recent heightened inflation create additional uncertainty, while climate change could, over time, add new uncertainties to the loss reserving process. necessary judgments are based on numerous factors and may be revised as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed, as new or improved methods are developed, or as laws change. hence, ultimate loss payments may differ from the estimate of the ultimate liabilities made at the balance sheet date. changes to our previous estimates of prior period loss reserves impact the reported calendar year underwriting results adversely if our estimates increase or favorably if our estimates decrease. the potential for variation in loss reserve estimates is impacted by numerous factors. reserve estimates for casualty lines are particularly uncertain given the lengthy reporting patterns and corresponding need for ibnr. case reserves for those claims reported by insureds or ceding companies to us prior to the balance sheet date and where we have sufficient information are determined by our claims personnel as appropriate based on the circumstances of the claim(s), standard claim handling practices, and professional judgment. furthermore, for our brandywine run-off operations and our assumed reinsurance operation, global reinsurance, we may adjust the case reserves as notified by the ceding company if the judgment of our respective claims department differs from that of the cedant. with respect to ibnr reserves and those claims that have been incurred but not reported prior to the balance sheet date, there is, by definition, limited actual information to form the case reserve estimate and reliance is placed upon historical loss experience and actuarial methods to estimate the ultimate loss obligations and the corresponding amount of ibnr. ibnr reserve estimates are generally calculated by first projecting the ultimate amount of losses for a product line and subtracting paid losses and case reserves for reported claims. the judgments involved in projecting the ultimate losses may pertain to the use and interpretation of various standard actuarial reserving methods that place reliance on the extrapolation of actual historical data, loss development patterns, industry data, and other benchmarks as appropriate. the estimate of the required ibnr reserve also requires judgment by actuaries and management to reflect the impact of more contemporary and subjective factors, both qualitative and quantitative. among some of these factors that might be considered are changes in business mix or volume, changes in ceded reinsurance structures, changes in claims handling practices, reported and projected loss trends, inflation, the legal environment, and the terms and conditions of the contracts sold to our insured parties. determining management's best estimate our recorded reserves represent management's best estimate of the provision for unpaid claims as of the balance sheet date, and establishing them involves a process that includes collaboration with various relevant parties in the company. for information on our reserving process, refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. sensitivity to underlying assumptions while we believe that our reserve for unpaid losses and loss expenses at december 31, 2022, is adequate, new information or emerging trends that differ from our assumptions may lead to future development of losses and loss expenses that is significantly greater or less than the recorded reserve, which could have a material effect on future operating results. as noted previously, our best estimate of required loss reserves for most portfolios is judgmentally selected for each origin year after considering the results from a number of reserving methods and is not a purely mechanical process. therefore, it is difficult to convey, in a simple and quantitative manner, the impact that a change to a single assumption will have on our best estimate. in the examples below, we attempt to give an indication of the potential impact by isolating a single change for a specific reserving method that would be pertinent in establishing the best estimate for the product line described. we consider each of the following sensitivity analyses to represent a reasonably likely deviation in the underlying assumption. north america commercial p&c insurance - workers' compensation given the long reporting and paid development patterns for workers' compensation business, the development factors used to project actual current losses to ultimate losses for our current exposure require considerable judgment that could be material to consolidated loss and loss expense reserves. specifically, adjusting ground up ultimate losses by a one percentage point change in the tail factor (i.e., 1.04 changed to either 1.05 or 1.03) would cause a change of approximately $1.1 billion, either positive or negative, for the projected net loss and loss expense reserves. this represents an impact of about 10.6 percent relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately $10.0 billion. north america commercial p&c insurance - liability as is the case for workers' compensation above, given the long reporting and paid development patterns, the development factors used to project actual current losses to ultimate losses for our current exposure require considerable judgment that could be material to consolidated loss and loss expense reserves. specifically, for our main u.s. excess/umbrella portfolios, a five percentage point change in the tail factor (e.g., 1.10 changed to either 1.15 or 1.05) would cause a change of approximately $637 million, either positive or negative, for the projected net loss and loss expense reserves. this represents an impact of about 17.8 percent relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately $3.6 billion for these portfolios. the reserve portfolio for our chubb bermuda operations contains exposure to predominantly high excess liability coverage on an occurrence-first-reported basis (typically with attachment points in excess of $325 million and gross limits of up to $150 million) and d&o and other professional liability coverage on a claims-made basis (typically with attachment points in excess of $125 million and gross limits of up to $75 million). due to the layer of exposure covered, the expected frequency for this book is very low. as a result of the low frequency/high severity nature of the book, a small difference in the actual vs. expected claim frequency, either positive or negative, could result in a material change to the projected ultimate loss if such change in claim frequency was related to a policy where close to maximum limits were deployed. north america personal p&c insurance due to the relatively short-tailed nature of many of the coverages involved (e.g., homeowners property damage), most of the incurred losses in personal lines are resolved within a few years of occurrence. as shown in our loss triangle disclosure, the vast majority (almost 95 percent) of personal lines net ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses are typically paid within five years of the accident date and 80 percent within two years. even though there are significant reserves associated with some liability exposures such as personal excess/umbrella liability, our incurred loss triangle also shows a roughly consistent pattern of only relatively minor movements in incurred estimates over time by accident year especially after twenty-four months of maturity. while the liability exposures are subject to additional uncertainties from more protracted resolution times, the main drivers of volatility in the personal lines business are relatively short-term in nature and relate to things like natural catastrophes, non-catastrophe weather events, man-made risks, and individual large loss volatility from other fortuitous claim events. north america agricultural insurance approximately 58 percent of the reserves for this segment are from the crop related lines, which all have short payout patterns, with the majority of the liabilities expected to be resolved in the ensuing twelve months. claim reserves for our multiple peril crop insurance (mpci) product are set on a case-by-case basis and our aggregate exposure is subject to state level risk sharing formulae as well as third-party reinsurance. the majority of the development risk arises out of the accuracy of case reserve estimates and the time needed for final crop conditions to be assessed. we do not view our agriculture reserves as substantially influenced by the general assumptions and risks underlying more typical p&c reserve estimates. overseas general insurance certain long-tail lines, such as casualty and financial lines, are particularly susceptible to changes in loss trend and claim inflation. heightened perceptions of tort and settlement awards around the world can increase the demand for these products as well as contributing to the uncertainty in the reserving estimates. our reserving methods rely on loss development patterns estimated from historical data and while we attempt to adjust such factors for known changes in the current tort environment, it is possible that such factors may not entirely reflect all recent trends in tort environments. for example, when applying the reported loss development method, the lengthening of our selected loss development patterns by six months would increase reserve estimates on long-tail casualty and financial lines for accident years 2020 and prior by approximately $582 million. this represents an impact of 14.0 percent relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately $4.2 billion. global reinsurance at december 31, 2022, net unpaid losses and loss expenses for the global reinsurance segment aggregated to $1.7 billion, consisting of $764 million of case reserves and $938 million of ibnr. in comparison, at december 31, 2021, net unpaid losses and loss expenses for the global reinsurance segment aggregated to $1.6 billion, consisting of $781 million of case reserves and $783 million of ibnr. for our catastrophe business, we principally estimate unpaid losses and loss expenses on an event basis by considering various sources of information, including specific loss estimates reported by our cedants, ceding company and overall industry loss estimates reported by our brokers, and our internal data regarding reinsured exposures related to the geographical location of the event. our internal data analysis enables us to establish catastrophe reserves for known events with more certainty at an earlier date than would be the case if we solely relied on reports from third parties to determine carried reserves. for our casualty reinsurance business, we generally rely on ceding companies to report claims and then use that data as a key input to estimate unpaid losses and loss expenses. due to the reliance on claims information reported by ceding companies, as well as other factors, the estimation of unpaid losses and loss expenses for assumed reinsurance includes certain risks and uncertainties that are unique relative to our direct insurance business. these include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: •the reported claims information could be inaccurate; •typically, a lag exists between the reporting of a loss event to a ceding company and its reporting to us as a reinsurance claim. the use of a broker to transmit financial information from a ceding company to us increases the reporting lag. because most of our reinsurance business is produced by brokers, ceding companies generally first submit claim and other financial information to brokers, who then report the proportionate share of such information to each reinsurer of a particular treaty. the reporting lag generally results in a longer period of time between the date a claim is incurred and the date a claim is reported compared with direct insurance operations. therefore, the risk of delayed recognition of loss reserve development is higher for assumed reinsurance than for direct insurance lines; and •the historical claims data for a particular reinsurance contract can be limited relative to our insurance business in that there may be less historical information available. further, for certain coverages or products, such as excess of loss contracts, there may be relatively few expected claims in a particular year so the actual number of claims may be susceptible to significant variability. in such cases, the actuary often relies on industry data from several recognized sources. we mitigate the above risks in several ways. in addition to routine analytical reviews of ceding company reports to ensure reported claims information appears reasonable, we perform regular underwriting and claims audits of certain ceding companies to ensure reported claims information is accurate, complete, and timely. as appropriate, audit findings are used to adjust claims in the reserving process. we also use our knowledge of the historical development of losses from individual ceding companies to adjust the level of adequacy we believe exists in the reported ceded losses. on occasion, there will be differences between our carried loss reserves and unearned premium reserves and the amount of loss reserves and unearned premium reserves reported by the ceding companies. this is due to the fact that we receive consistent and timely information from ceding companies only with respect to case reserves. for ibnr, we use historical experience and other statistical information, depending on the type of business, to estimate the ultimate loss. we estimate our unearned premium reserve by applying estimated earning patterns to net premiums written for each treaty based upon that treaty's coverage basis (i.e., risks attaching or losses occurring). at december 31, 2022, the case reserves, net of retrocessions, reported to us by our ceding companies approximated our recorded case reserves. our policy is to post additional case reserves in addition to the amounts reported by our cedants when our evaluation of the ultimate value of a reported claim is different than the evaluation of that claim by our cedant. typically, there is inherent uncertainty around the length of paid and reported development patterns, especially for certain casualty lines such as excess workers' compensation or general liability, which may take decades to fully develop. this uncertainty is accentuated by the need to supplement client development patterns with industry development patterns due to the sometimes low statistical credibility of the data. the underlying source and selection of the final development patterns can thus have a significant impact on the selected ultimate net losses and loss expenses. for example, a 20 percent shortening or lengthening of the development patterns used for u.s. long-tail lines would cause the loss reserve estimate derived by the reported bornhuetter-ferguson method for these lines to change by approximately $205 million. this represents an impact of 28 percent relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately $745 million. corporate within corporate, we have exposure to certain liability insurance and reinsurance lines that have been in run-off, generally, since 1994. unpaid losses and loss expenses relating to this run-off business reside within the brandywine division. most of the remaining unpaid loss and loss expense reserves for the run-off business relate to a&e as well as molestation claims. the a&e liabilities principally relate to claims arising from bodily-injury claims related to asbestos products and remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites. the estimation of our a&e liabilities is particularly sensitive to future changes in the legal, social, and economic environment. we have not assumed any such future changes in setting the value of our a&e liabilities, which include provisions for both reported and ibnr claims. there are many complex variables that we consider when estimating the reserves for our inventory of asbestos accounts and these variables may directly impact the predicted outcome. we believe the most significant variables relating to our asbestos liabilities include the current legal environment; specific settlements that may be used as precedents to settle future claims; assumptions regarding trends with respect to claim severity and the frequency of higher severity claims; assumptions regarding the ability to allocate liability among defendants (including bankruptcy trusts) and other insurers; the ability of a claimant to bring a claim in a state in which they have no residency or exposure; the ability of a policyholder to claim the right to unaggregated coverage; whether high-level excess policies have the potential to be accessed given the policyholder's claim trends and liability situation; payments to unimpaired claimants; and the potential liability of peripheral defendants. based on the policies, the facts, the law, and a careful analysis of the impact that these factors will likely have on any given account, we estimate the potential liability for indemnity, policyholder defense costs, and coverage litigation expense. the results in asbestos cases announced by other carriers or defendants may well have little or no relevance to us because coverage exposures are highly dependent upon the specific facts of individual coverage and resolution status of disputes among carriers, policyholders, and claimants. chubb's exposure to molestation claims principally arises out of liabilities acquired when it purchased cigna's p&c business in 1999 and chubb corp in 2016. the vast majority of the current liability relates to exposure from recently enacted \"reviver\" legislation in certain states that allow civil claims relating to molestation to be asserted against policyholders that would otherwise be barred by statutes of limitations. for additional information refer to the \"asbestos and environmental (a&e)\" section and to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. future policy benefits reserves we issue contracts in our overseas general insurance and life insurance segments that are classified as long-duration. these contracts generally include accident and supplemental health products, term and whole life products, endowment products, and annuities. in accordance with gaap, we establish reserves for contracts determined to be long-duration based on approved actuarial methods that include assumptions related to expenses, mortality, morbidity, persistency and investment yields. for traditional long-duration contracts, these assumptions also include a provision for adverse deviation (pad), and are \"locked in\" at the inception of the contract, meaning we use our original assumptions throughout the life of the policy and do not subsequently modify them unless we deem the reserves to be inadequate; while for non-traditional long-duration contracts, the assumptions do not include a pad and are unlocked at each reporting date. the future policy benefits reserves balance is regularly evaluated for a premium deficiency. if experience is less favorable than assumptions, additional liabilities may be required, resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims. effective january 1, 2023, we adopted ldti that affects the accounting for future policy benefit reserves. as a result, cash flow assumptions underlying the liability for future policy benefits for traditional and limited-payment contracts must be updated at least annually reflecting current best estimate assumptions whereas under prior u.s. gaap guidance such assumptions are locked-in for the life of the policy as noted previously. the discount rate at contract issuance is locked in for purposes of determining interest accretion recognized through earnings over the life of the contract; however, on a quarterly basis, ldti also requires the remeasurement of the liability for future policy benefits using the then-current discount rate with changes recognized in oci. in addition, under ldti a provision for adverse deviation is no longer allowed when establishing reserves, premium deficiency testing is no longer required, and the net premium ratio cannot exceed 100 percent for any given cohort of contracts. valuation of value of business acquired (voba), and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and voba as part of the acquisition of businesses that sell long-duration contracts, such as life products, we established an intangible asset related to voba, which represented the fair value of the future profits of the in-force contracts. the valuation of voba at the time of acquisition is derived from similar assumptions to those used to establish the associated future policy benefits reserves. the most significant input in this calculation is the discount rate used to arrive at the present value of the net cash flows. we amortize deferred policy acquisition costs associated with long-duration contracts and voba (collectively policy acquisition costs) over the estimated life of the contracts, generally in proportion to premium revenue recognized based upon the same assumptions used in estimating the liability for future policy benefits. for non-traditional long-duration contracts, we amortize policy acquisition costs over the expected life of the contracts in proportion to estimates of expected gross profits. the estimated life is established at the inception of the contracts or upon acquisition and is based on current persistency assumptions. policy acquisition costs, which consist of commissions, premium taxes, and certain underwriting costs related directly to the successful acquisition of a new or renewal insurance contract, are reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from future income, including investment income. unrecoverable costs are expensed in the period identified. effective january 1, 2023, we adopted ldti that affects the accounting for deferred policy acquisition costs and voba. as a result, we will amortize deferred policy acquisition costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the contract, as compared to in proportion to premium revenue or expected gross profits as noted previously. in addition, we have elected to align our voba amortization with the new requirement under ldti for deferred policy acquisition costs. risk transfer in the ordinary course of business, we both purchase (or cede) and sell (or assume) reinsurance protection. we discontinued the purchase of all finite risk reinsurance contracts, as a matter of policy, in 2002. for both ceded and assumed reinsurance, risk transfer requirements must be met in order to use reinsurance accounting, principally resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract as premiums and losses. if risk transfer requirements are not met, a contract is to be accounted for as a deposit, typically resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract through a deposit asset or liability and not as revenue or expense. to meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance contract must include both insurance risk, consisting of underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity. we also apply similar risk transfer requirements to determine whether certain commercial insurance contracts should be accounted for as insurance or a deposit. contracts that include fixed premium (i.e., premium not subject to adjustment based on loss experience under the contract) for fixed coverage generally transfer risk and do not require judgment. reinsurance and insurance contracts that include both significant risk sharing provisions, such as adjustments to premiums or loss coverage based on loss experience, and relatively low policy limits, as evidenced by a high proportion of maximum premium assessments to loss limits, can require considerable judgment to determine whether or not risk transfer requirements are met. for such contracts, often referred to as finite or structured products, we require that risk transfer be specifically assessed for each contract by developing expected cash flow analyses at contract inception. to support risk transfer, the cash flow analyses must demonstrate that a significant loss is reasonably possible. we use various tests to accomplish this, one of which is the ratio of the net present value of losses and commissions divided by the net present value of premiums equals or exceeds 110 percent with at least a 10 percent probability. for purposes of cash flow analyses, we generally use a risk-free rate of return consistent with the expected average duration of loss payments. in addition, to support insurance risk, we must prove the reinsurer's risk of loss varies with that of the reinsured and/or support various scenarios under which the assuming entity can recognize a significant loss. to ensure risk transfer requirements are routinely assessed, qualitative and quantitative risk transfer analyses and memoranda supporting risk transfer are developed by underwriters for all structured products. we have established protocols for structured products that include criteria triggering an accounting review of the contract prior to quoting. if any criterion is triggered, a contract must be reviewed by a committee established by each of our segments with reporting oversight, including peer review, from our global structured transaction review committee. with respect to ceded reinsurance, we entered into a few multi-year excess of loss retrospectively-rated contracts, principally in 2002. these contracts primarily provided severity protection for specific product divisions. because traditional one-year reinsurance coverage had become relatively costly, these contracts were generally entered into in order to secure a more cost-effective reinsurance program. all of these contracts transferred risk and were accounted for as reinsurance. in addition, we maintain a few aggregate excess of loss reinsurance contracts that were principally entered into prior to 2003, such as the national indemnity company (nico) contracts referred to in the section entitled, \"asbestos and environmental (a&e)\". we have not purchased any other retroactive ceded reinsurance contracts since 1999. with respect to assumed reinsurance and insurance contracts, products giving rise to judgments regarding risk transfer were primarily sold by our financial solutions business. although we have significantly curtailed writing financial solutions business, several contracts remain in-force and principally include multi-year retrospectively-rated contracts and loss portfolio transfers. because transfer of insurance risk is generally a primary client motivation for purchasing these products, relatively few insurance and reinsurance contracts have historically been written for which we concluded that risk transfer criteria had not been met. for certain insurance contracts that have been reported as deposits, the insured desired to self-insure a risk but was required, legally or otherwise, to purchase insurance so that claimants would be protected by a licensed insurance company in the event of non-payment from the insured. reinsurance recoverable reinsurance recoverable includes balances due to us from reinsurance companies for paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses and is presented net of a valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is determined based upon a review of the financial condition of the reinsurers and other factors. ceded reinsurance contracts do not relieve our primary obligation to our policyholders. consequently, an exposure exists with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer is unable or unwilling to meet its obligations or disputes the liabilities assumed under the reinsurance contracts. we determine the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses using actuarial estimates as well as a determination of our ability to cede unpaid losses and loss expenses under existing reinsurance contracts. the recognition of a reinsurance recoverable asset requires two key judgments. the first judgment involves our estimation based on the amount of gross reserves and the percentage of that amount which may be ceded to reinsurers. ceded ibnr, which is a major component of the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses, is generally developed as part of our loss reserving process and, consequently, its estimation is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimation of gross ibnr (refer to \"critical accounting estimates - unpaid losses and loss expenses\"). the second judgment involves our estimate of the amount of the reinsurance recoverable balance that we may ultimately be unable to recover from reinsurers due to insolvency, contractual dispute, or for other reasons. estimated uncollectible amounts are reflected in a valuation allowance that reduces the reinsurance recoverable asset and, in turn, shareholders' equity. changes in the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance are reflected in net income. although the obligation of individual reinsurers to pay their reinsurance obligations is based on specific contract provisions, the collectability of such amounts requires estimation by management. the majority of the recoverable balance will not be due for collection until sometime in the future, and the duration of our recoverables may be longer than the duration of our direct exposures. over this period of time, economic conditions and operational performance of a particular reinsurer may impact their ability to meet these obligations and while they may continue to acknowledge their contractual obligation to do so, they may not have the financial resources or willingness to fully meet their obligation to us. to estimate the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, the reinsurance recoverable must first be determined for each reinsurer. this determination is based on a process rather than an estimate, although an element of judgment must be applied. as part of the process, ceded ibnr is allocated to reinsurance contracts because ceded ibnr is not generally calculated on a contract by contract basis. the allocations are generally based on premiums ceded under reinsurance contracts, adjusted for actual loss experience and historical relationships between gross and ceded losses. if actual premium and loss experience vary materially from historical experience, the allocation of reinsurance recoverable by reinsurer will be reviewed and may change. while such change is unlikely to result in a large percentage change in the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, it could, nevertheless, have a material effect on our net income in the period recorded. generally, we use a default analysis to estimate uncollectible reinsurance. the primary components of the default analysis are reinsurance recoverable balances by reinsurer, net of collateral, and forward looking default factors used to estimate the probability that the reinsurer may be unable to meet its future obligations in full. the definition of collateral for this purpose requires some judgment and is generally limited to assets held in a chubb-only beneficiary trust, letters of credit, and liabilities held by us with the same legal entity for which we believe there is a right of offset. we do not currently include multi-beneficiary trusts. however, we have several reinsurers that have established multi-beneficiary trusts for which certain of our companies are beneficiaries. the determination of the default factor is principally based on the financial strength rating of the reinsurer and a corresponding default factor applicable to the financial strength rating. default factors require considerable judgment and are determined using the current financial strength rating, or rating equivalent, of each reinsurer as well as other key considerations and assumptions. significant considerations and assumptions include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: •for reinsurers that maintain a financial strength rating from a major rating agency, and for which recoverable balances are considered representative of the larger population (i.e., default probabilities are consistent with similarly rated reinsurers and payment durations conform to averages), the judgment exercised by management to determine the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance of each reinsurer is typically limited because the financial rating is based on a published source and the default factor we apply is based on a historical default factor of a major rating agency applicable to the particular rating class. default factors applied for financial ratings of aaa, aa, a, bbb, bb, b, and ccc, are 0.8 percent, 1.2 percent, 1.7 percent, 4.9 percent, 19.6 percent, 34.0 percent, and 62.2 percent, respectively. because our model is predicated on the historical default factors of a major rating agency, we do not generally consider alternative factors. however, when a recoverable is expected to be paid in a brief period of time by a highly-rated reinsurer, such as certain property catastrophe claims, a default factor may not be applied; •for balances recoverable from reinsurers that are both unrated by a major rating agency and for which management is unable to determine a credible rating equivalent based on a parent or affiliated company, we may determine a rating equivalent based on our analysis of the reinsurer that considers an assessment of the creditworthiness of the particular entity, industry benchmarks, or other factors as considered appropriate. we then apply the applicable default factor for that rating class. for balances recoverable from unrated reinsurers for which our ceded reserve is below a certain threshold, we generally apply a default factor of 34.0 percent; •for balances recoverable from reinsurers that are either insolvent or under regulatory supervision, we establish a default factor and resulting valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance based on specific facts and circumstances surrounding each company. upon initial notification of an insolvency, we generally recognize expense for a substantial portion of all balances outstanding, net of collateral, through a combination of write-offs of recoverable balances and increases to the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. when regulatory action is taken on a reinsurer, we generally recognize a default factor by estimating an expected recovery on all balances outstanding, net of collateral. when sufficient credible information becomes available, we adjust the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance by establishing a default factor pursuant to information received; and •for captives and other recoverables, management determines the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance based on the specific facts and circumstances. the following table summarizes reinsurance recoverables and the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance for each type of recoverable balance at december 31, 2022: gross reinsurance recoverable on losses and loss expenses recoverables (net of usable collateral) valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance (1) (in millions of u.s. dollars) type reinsurers with credit ratings $15,179 $13,256 $174 reinsurers not rated 251 171 57 reinsurers under supervision and insolvent reinsurers 70 67 27 captives 2,455 348 13 other, including structured settlements and pools 1,297 1,276 80 total $19,252 $15,118 $351 (1) the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is based on a default analysis applied to gross reinsurance recoverables, net of approximately $4.1 billion of collateral at december 31, 2022. at december 31, 2022, the use of different assumptions within our approach could have a material effect on the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. to the extent the creditworthiness of our reinsurers was to deteriorate due to an adverse event affecting the reinsurance industry, such as a large number of major catastrophes, actual uncollectible amounts could be significantly greater than our valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. such an event could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and our liquidity. given the various considerations used to estimate our uncollectible valuation allowance, we cannot precisely quantify the effect a specific industry event may have on the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. however, based on the composition (particularly the average credit quality) of the reinsurance recoverable balance at december 31, 2022, we estimate that a ratings downgrade of one notch for all rated reinsurers (e.g., from a to a- or a- to bbb+) could increase our valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance by approximately $93 million or approximately 0.5 percent of the gross reinsurance recoverable balance, assuming no other changes relevant to the calculation. while a ratings downgrade would result in an increase in our valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance and a charge to earnings in that period, a downgrade in and of itself does not imply that we will be unable to collect all of the ceded reinsurance recoverable from the reinsurers in question. refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, under item 8, for additional information. fair value measurements accounting guidance defines fair value as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy based on the reliability of the inputs. the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (level 1 inputs) and the lowest priority to unobservable data (level 3 inputs). level 2 includes inputs, other than quoted prices within level 1, that are observable for assets or liabilities either directly or indirectly. refer to note 4 and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, under item 8, for information on our fair value measurements. assessment of investment portfolio credit losses each quarter, we evaluate current expected credit losses (cecl) for fixed maturity securities classified as held to maturity and expected credit losses (ecl) for fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale. because our investment portfolio is the largest component of consolidated assets, cecl and ecl could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. refer to notes 1 e) and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, under item 8, for more information. deferred income taxes at december 31, 2022, our net deferred tax liability was $292 million. our deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily result from temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities. we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities separately for each tax-paying component (an individual entity or group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes) in each tax jurisdiction. the realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax jurisdiction. there may be changes in tax laws in a number of countries where we transact business that impact our deferred tax assets and liabilities. at each balance sheet date, management assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all, or some portion, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the determination of the need for a valuation allowance is based on all available information including projections of future taxable income, principally derived from business plans and where appropriate available tax planning strategies. projections of future taxable income incorporate assumptions of future business and operations that are apt to differ from actual experience. if our assumptions and estimates that resulted in our forecast of future taxable income prove to be incorrect, an additional valuation allowance could become necessary, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. at december 31, 2022, the valuation allowance of $916 million reflects management's assessment that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized due to the inability of certain subsidiaries to generate sufficient taxable income. goodwill impairment assessment goodwill, which represents the excess of acquisition cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired, was $16.3 billion and $15.2 billion at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. during 2022, our goodwill balance increased reflecting the acquisition of cigna's asia business. goodwill is assigned to applicable reporting units of acquired entities at the time of acquisition. our reporting units are the same as our reportable segments. for goodwill balances by reporting units, refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, under item 8. goodwill is not amortized but is subject to a periodic evaluation for impairment at least annually, or earlier if there are any indications of possible impairment. impairment is tested at the reporting unit level. the impairment evaluation first uses a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e., more than a 50 percent probability) that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount. if a reporting unit fails this qualitative assessment, a single quantitative analysis is used to measure and record the amount of the impairment. in assessing the fair value of a reporting unit, we make assumptions and estimates about the profitability attributable to our reporting units, including: •short-term and long-term growth rates; and •estimated cost of equity and changes in long-term risk-free interest rates. if our assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of acquired entities change, we could be required to write-down the carrying value of goodwill which could be material to our results of operations in the period the charge is taken. based on our impairment testing for 2022, we determined no impairment was required and none of our reporting units were at risk for impairment. consolidated operating results - years ended december

2021. net income in 2022 was driven by strong underwriting results, including growth in net premiums earned, improvement in our combined ratios, and record net investment income. net income is lower compared to prior year, reflecting after-tax mark-to-market losses on private and public equities of $791 million, compared to gains of $2.4 billion in the prior year. •consolidated net premiums written were $41.8 billion, up 10.3 percent, or 13.0 percent in constant dollars, primarily from strong premium retention, including both rate and exposure increases, and strong new business in our p&c business. additionally, the acquisition of cigna's business in asia added 3.8 percentage points, or 3.9 percentage points in constant dollars, to the growth in net premiums written. •consolidated net premiums earned were $40.4 billion, up 11.1 percent, or 13.9 percent in constant dollars. the acquisition of cigna's business in asia added 3.9 percentage points, or 4.0 percentage points in constant dollars, to the growth in net premiums earned. •total pre-tax and after-tax catastrophe losses were $2.2 billion (5.9 percentage points of the p&c combined ratio) and $1.8 billion, respectively, compared with $2.4 billion (7.1 percentage points of the p&c combined ratio) and $2.0 billion, respectively, in 2021. pre-tax catastrophe losses in 2022 were primarily from hurricane ian losses of $975 million, winter storm elliott losses of $400 million, and other global weather-related events. •total pre-tax and after-tax favorable prior period development were $876 million (2.5 percentage points of the combined ratio) and $729 million, respectively, including pre-tax adverse development of $155 million for molestation claims, predominantly reviver statute-related, and $113 million related to legacy asbestos and environmental exposures. excluding the adverse development, we had pre-tax favorable development of $1,144 million, with 18 percent in long-tail lines, and 82 percent in short-tail lines. this compares with favorable prior period development of $926 million (2.8 percentage points of the combined ratio) and $756 million, respectively, in 2021. refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, under item 8, for further information on prior period development. •the p&c combined ratio was 87.6 percent compared with 89.1 percent in 2021. p&c current accident year (cay) combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses was 84.2 percent compared with 84.8 percent in the prior year. the current year ratios decreased due to the favorable impact of higher net premiums earned on the expense ratios and underlying loss ratio improvement, partially offset by late-season losses in crop insurance. •net investment income was a record $3.7 billion compared with $3.5 billion in 2021, primarily due to higher reinvestment rates on fixed maturities, partially offset by lower income from equity securities and private equities. •operating cash flow was a record $11.2 billion compared with $11.1 billion in 2021. •shareholders' equity decreased by $9.2 billion in 2022, as net income of $5.3 billion was more than offset by unrealized losses on investments of $9.5 billion after-tax from rising interest rates and a loss of $927 million related to cumulative foreign exchange translation. in addition, shareholders' equity reflected total capital returned to shareholders in the year of $4.4 billion, including share repurchases of $3.0 billion, at an average purchase price of $201.96 per share, and dividends of $1.4 billion. •on january 4, 2023, we completed transactions that increased our ownership interest in huatai group from 47.3 percent to 64.2 percent. we received regulatory approval for an additional 19 percent and expect to close on these shares upon completion of certain closing conditions, at which time we expect to consolidate the operations of huatai group as a subsidiary of chubb under the u.s. gaap consolidation standard. outlook 2022 was an outstanding year in terms of underlying business and investment performance. we had record net investment income and an excellent combined ratio despite late-season losses in crop insurance. consolidated net premiums written increased to $41.8 billion, reflecting strong growth across our p&c segments and a growing life insurance segment with the addition of the cigna asian business on july 1, 2022. looking ahead, we are starting off strong in the first quarter 2023 thus far, with growth in our asian consumer business, including p&c, life insurance and a&h. our global consumer lines growth is gaining momentum highlighted by a combination of strong consumer lending, increased foot traffic across retail and banking operations, and the resurgence of leisure and business travel. we had good growth in net investment income and will continue to grow as we reinvest cash flow at higher rates. in summary, the strong trajectory of growth from investment income and our asia life insurance companies, provides an optimistic outlook for the future. net premiums written % change (in millions of u.s. dollars, except for percentages) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021

full year growth. growth from new business in asia, primarily in thailand and indonesia, was more than offset by lower business in taiwan and latin america, principally reflecting the non-renewal of certain large account business in chile. for additional information on net premiums written, refer to the segment results discussions. net premiums earned net premiums earned for short-duration contracts, typically p&c contracts, generally reflect the portion of net premiums written that was recorded as revenues for the period as the exposure periods expire. net premiums earned for long-duration contracts, typically traditional life contracts, generally are recognized as earned when due from policyholders. net premiums earned increased $4.0 billion, or $4.9 billion on a constant-dollar basis in 2022. catastrophe losses and prior period development catastrophe losses include reinstatement premiums which are additional premiums paid on certain reinsurance agreements in order to reinstate coverage that had been exhausted by loss occurrences. the reinstatement premium amount is typically a pro rata portion of the original ceded premium paid based on how much of the reinsurance limit had been exhausted. prior period development is net of expense adjustments which typically relate to either profit commission reserves or policyholder dividend reserves based on actual claim experience that develops after the policy period ends. refer to the non-gaap reconciliation section for further information on reinstatement premiums on catastrophe losses and adjustments to prior period development. we generally define catastrophe loss events consistent with the definition of the property claims service (pcs) for events in the u.s. and canada. pcs defines a catastrophe as an event that causes damage of $25 million or more in insured losses and affects a significant number of insureds. for events outside of the u.s. and canada, we generally use a similar definition. we also define losses from certain pandemics, such as covid-19, as a catastrophe loss. prior period development (ppd) arises from changes to loss estimates recognized in the current year that relate to loss events that occurred in previous calendar years and excludes the effect of losses from the development of earned premium from previous accident years. (in millions of u.s. dollars) 2022 2021 2020 catastrophe losses $2,182 $2,401 $3,283 favorable prior period development $876 $926 $395 catastrophe losses were primarily from the following events: •2022: hurricane ian losses of $975 million, winter storm elliott losses of $400 million, severe weather-related events in the u.s. and internationally, australia storms, and colorado wildfires. • 2021: hurricane ida losses of $834 million, winter storm losses in the u.s., flooding in europe, and other severe weather-related events in the u.s. and internationally. • 2020: covid-19 pandemic claims of $1,396 million, severe weather-related events in the u.s. and internationally, and civil unrest-related losses in the u.s. pre-tax net favorable prior period development for 2022 was $876 million, including adverse development of $155 million for molestation claims, primarily reviver statute-related, and $113 million related to legacy asbestos and environmental exposures. the remaining favorable development of $1,144 million is primarily comprised of 18 percent in long-tail lines, principally from accident years 2011 through 2017, and 82 percent in short-tail lines, mainly in property and a&h lines. pre-tax net favorable prior period development for 2021 was $926 million, including adverse development of $443 million for molestation claims, of which $375 million was related to the pending boy scouts of america settlement in the fourth quarter, and $83 million related to legacy a&e exposures. the remaining favorable development of $1,452 million, including favorable development of $430 million for covid-related claims, is primarily comprised of 39 percent in long-tail lines, principally from accident years 2020 and 2017 and prior, and 61 percent in short-tail lines, mainly in homeowners, accident and health, property, and surety lines. pre-tax net favorable prior period development for 2020 was $395 million, which included adverse development of $259 million for u.s. child molestation claims, predominately reviver statute-related, and $106 million adverse development related to legacy asbestos and environmental liabilities. the remaining favorable development of $760 million principally comprises 89 percent long-tail lines, principally from accident years 2016 and prior, and 11 percent short-tail lines. refer to the prior period development section in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. p&c combined ratio in evaluating our segments excluding life insurance financial performance, we use the p&c combined ratio, the loss and loss expense ratio, the policy acquisition cost ratio, and the administrative expense ratio. we calculate these ratios by dividing the respective expense amounts by net premiums earned. we do not calculate these ratios for the life insurance segment as we do not use these measures to monitor or manage that segment. the p&c combined ratio is determined by adding the loss and loss expense ratio, the policy acquisition cost ratio, and the administrative expense ratio. a p&c combined ratio under 100 percent indicates underwriting income, and a combined ratio exceeding 100 percent indicates underwriting loss. 2022 2021 2020 loss and loss expense ratio cay loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses 58.8 % 58.3 % 59.2 % catastrophe losses 6.0 % 7.1 % 10.6

% 8.7 % p&amp;c combined ratio 87.6 % 89.1 % 96.1 % the loss and loss expense ratio decreased in 2022, primarily due to lower catastrophe losses. the cay loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses increased in 2022, primarily due to a lower 2022 crop year margin, partially offset by earned rate exceeding loss cost trends. the policy acquisition cost ratio decreased in 2022 primarily due to a higher percent of net premiums earned from lines that have a lower acquisition cost ratio. the administrative expense ratio decreased in 2022 primarily due to higher net premiums earned, which outpaced higher employee-related expenses, and increased investment to support growth. policy benefits policy benefits represent losses on contracts classified as long-duration and generally include accident and supplemental health products, term and whole life products, endowment products, and annuities. refer to the life insurance segment operating results section for further discussion. policy benefits were $1,492 million, $699 million and $784 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, which included (gains) losses from fair value changes in separate account liabilities that do not qualify for separate account reporting under gaap of $(42) million, $(8) million and $58 million, respectively. the offsetting movements of these liabilities are recorded in other (income) expense on the consolidated statements of operations. excluding the separate account gains and losses, policy benefits were $1,534 million, $707 million, and $726 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. the increase in policy benefits for 2022 is primarily due to the acquisition of cigna's business in asia. refer to the respective sections that follow for a discussion of net investment income, other (income) expense, net realized gains (losses), interest expense, amortization of purchased intangibles, and income tax expense. segment operating results - years ended december 31, 2022, 2021, and

21.7 percent, in 2022, primarily due to an increase in mpci, reflecting higher commodity prices, higher reported acreage from policyholders, and policy count growth, partly offset by a return of premium to the u.s. government in the first quarter of 2022 of $161 million. under the profit-sharing agreement, we returned additional premiums to the government because of the lower losses experienced in certain states in 2021. this return of premium reduced net premiums written growth in 2022 by 6.7 percentage points. net premiums earned increased $500 million, or 21.4 percent, in 2022 reflecting the growth in net premiums written described above. underwriting income underwriting income decreased $90 million in 2022, reflecting a lower 2022 crop year margin from drought conditions experienced in specific areas, which caused lower yields across spring crops and, to a lesser extent, higher harvest prices. combined ratio the combined ratio for 2022 was impacted by the return of premium to the u.s. government under the profit-sharing agreement related to the profitable 2021 crop year described above. this prior period development resulted in a reduction to net premiums earned of $161 million and a corresponding reduction to incurred losses, with no net impact to underwriting income. the loss and loss expense ratio and the cay loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses increased in 2022, reflecting the lower 2022 crop year margin noted above. the policy acquisition cost ratio decreased in 2022 primarily due to the favorable impact of higher net premiums earned from mpci. 56 overseas general insurance overseas general insurance segment comprises chubb international and chubb global markets (cgm). chubb international comprises our international commercial p&c

premiums written increased 96.9 percent, primarily due to the acquisition of cigna's business in asia, which contributed $1,360 million. in addition, growth from new business in indonesia and thailand, was more than offset by lower business in taiwan and latin america, principally reflecting non-renewal of certain large account business in chile. net premiums written in our north america combined insurance business declined 9.1 percent, primarily due to the non-renewal of a large program. 60 deposits the following table presents deposits collected on universal life and investment

in accordance with gaap. new life deposits are an important component of production, and although they do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they are key to our efforts to grow our business. life deposits collected decreased $641 million, or $517 million on a constant-dollar basis, in 2022, primarily in taiwan, reflecting challenging market conditions for deposit products. additionally, the prior year benefited from successful sales campaigns in broker and bank channels in taiwan. partially offsetting the decline is $91 million from deposits collected from the acquired cigna business in asia, primarily in korea. life insurance segment income life insurance segment income increased $286 million in 2022 from higher underwriting income of $352 million, including $195 million of growth reflecting six months of the acquisition of cigna's business in asia, strong performance in combined insurance north america reflecting favorable reserve development, and higher net investment income. this increase was partially offset by an adverse non-recurring adjustment of $52 million in 2022 related to huatai life, our partially owned insurance entity in china. corporate corporate results primarily include the results of our non-insurance companies, income and expenses not attributable to reportable segments and loss and loss expenses of asbestos and

administrative expenses increased in 2022, primarily due to increased spending to support digital growth initiatives. cigna integration expenses of $48 million for 2022 principally comprised legal and professional fees and all other costs directly related to the integration activities of the cigna acquisition. these expenses are one-time in nature and are not related to the on-going business activities of the segments. the chief executive officer does not manage segment results or allocate resources to segments when considering these costs and they are therefore excluded from our definition of segment income. 61 refer to the respective sections that follow for a discussion of net realized gains (losses), net investment income (loss), amortization of purchased intangibles, and income tax expense (benefit). refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on other (income) expense. net realized and unrealized gains (losses) we take a long-term view with our investment strategy, and our investment managers manage our investment portfolio to maximize total return within specific guidelines designed to minimize risk. the majority of our investment portfolio is available for sale and reported at fair value. our held to maturity investment portfolio is reported at amortized cost, net of valuation allowance. the effect of market movements on our fixed maturities portfolio impacts net income (through net realized gains (losses)) when securities are sold, when we write down an asset, or when we record a change to the valuation allowance for expected credit losses. for a further discussion related to how we assess the valuation allowance for expected credit losses and the related impact on net income, refer to note 1 e) to the consolidated financial statements. additionally, net income is impacted through the reporting of changes in the fair value of equity securities, private equity funds where we own less than three percent, and derivatives, including financial futures, options, swaps, and glb reinsurance. changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on available for sale securities, resulting from the revaluation of securities held, changes in cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment, unrealized postretirement benefit obligations liability adjustment, and cross-currency swaps designated as hedges for accounting purposes are reported as separate components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheets. the following table

$1,152 $(2,946) $(1,794) $(498) pre-tax net unrealized losses of $10,598 million in our investment portfolio were principally the result of an increase in interest rates. in addition, there were pre-tax net realized losses of $1,353 million primarily from mark-to-market losses on public and private equities of $670 million. additionally, there were net losses of $683 million comprising of an increase in the valuation allowance of expected credit losses, impairments on fixed income securities, derivative losses, and losses from sales of fixed maturities, offset by gains from sales of equity securities. the variable annuity reinsurance derivative transactions consist of changes in the fair value of glb liabilities and gains or losses on other derivative instruments we maintain that decrease in fair value when the s&p 500 index increases. in 2022, the variable annuity reinsurance derivative transactions resulted in realized gains of $124 million, reflecting a net loss of $63 million, primarily from a decrease in the fair value of the glb liabilities due to higher interest rates, partially offset by lower global equity markets, and a net realized gain of $187 million related to the other derivative instruments. in 2021, the variable annuity reinsurance derivative transactions resulted in realized gains of $114 million, reflecting a net gain of $316 million, primarily from a decrease in the fair value of the glb liabilities due to higher global equity markets and higher interest rates, and a net realized loss of $202 million related to the other derivative instruments. effective income tax rate our effective tax rate (etr) was 19.1 percent, 13.0 percent, and 15.1 percent in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. our etr reflects a mix of income or losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates, permanent differences between u.s. gaap and local tax laws, and the impact of discrete items. a change in the geographic mix of earnings could impact our etr. the increase in the etr from 2021 to 2022 was due primarily to the impact of discrete items and realized losses as compared to realized gains in lower tax jurisdictions in the prior year. non-gaap reconciliation in presenting our results, we included and discussed certain non-gaap measures. these non-gaap measures, which may be defined differently by other companies, are important for an understanding of our overall results of operations and financial condition. however, they should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with gaap. book value per common share is shareholders' equity divided by the shares outstanding. tangible book value per common share is shareholders' equity less goodwill and other intangible assets, net of tax, divided by the shares outstanding. we believe that book value comparisons to less acquisitive peer companies are more meaningful when adjusted for goodwill and other intangible assets. the calculation of tangible book value per share does not consider the embedded goodwill attributable to our investments in partially-owned insurance companies until we consolidate. we provide financial measures, including net premiums written, net premiums earned, and underwriting income on a constant-dollar basis. we believe it is useful to evaluate the trends in our results exclusive of the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and the currencies in which our international business is transacted, as these exchange rates could fluctuate significantly between periods and distort the analysis of trends. the impact is determined by assuming constant foreign exchange rates between periods by translating prior period results using the same local currency exchange rates as the comparable current period. p&c performance metrics comprise consolidated operating results (including corporate) and exclude the operating results of the life insurance segment. we believe that these measures are useful and meaningful to investors as they are used by management to assess the company's p&c operations which are the most economically similar. we exclude the life insurance segment because the results of this business do not always correlate with the results of our p&c operations. p&c combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss expense ratio, policy acquisition cost ratio and the administrative expense ratio excluding the life business and including the realized gains and losses on the crop derivatives. these derivatives were purchased to provide economic benefit, in a manner similar to reinsurance protection, in the event that a significant decline in commodity pricing impacts underwriting results. we view gains and losses on these derivatives as part of the results of our underwriting operations. cay p&c combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses (cats) excludes cats and prior period development (ppd) from the p&c combined ratio. we exclude cats as they are not predictable as to timing and amount and ppd as these unexpected loss developments on historical reserves are not indicative of our current underwriting performance. the combined ratio numerator is adjusted to exclude cats, net premiums earned adjustments on ppd, prior period expense adjustments and reinstatement premiums on ppd, and the denominator is adjusted to exclude net premiums earned adjustments on ppd and reinstatement premiums on cats and ppd. in periods where there are adjustments on loss sensitive policies, these adjustments are excluded from ppd and net premiums earned when calculating the ratios. we believe this measure provides a better evaluation of our underwriting performance and enhances the understanding of the trends in our p&c business that may be obscured by these items. this measure is commonly reported among our peer companies and allows for a better comparison. reinstatement premiums are additional premiums paid on certain reinsurance agreements in order to reinstate coverage that had been exhausted by loss occurrences. the reinstatement premium amount is typically a pro rata portion of the original ceded premium paid based on how much of the reinsurance limit had been exhausted. net premiums earned adjustments within ppd are adjustments to the initial premium earned on retrospectively rated policies based on actual claim experience that develops after the policy period ends. the premium adjustments correlate to the prior period loss development on these same policies and are fully earned in the period the adjustments are recorded. prior period expense adjustments typically relate to adjustable commission reserves or policyholder dividend reserves based on actual claim experience that develops after the policy period ends. the expense adjustments correlate to the prior period loss development on these same policies. the following tables present the calculation of combined ratio, as reported for each segment to p&c combined ratio, adjusted for cats and ppd: north america commercial p&amp;c insurance north america personal p&amp;c insurance north america agricultural insurance overseas general

adjustment of acquired invested assets in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. excludes investment income from our private equities where we own more than 3 percent interest. net investment income is influenced by a number of factors including the amounts and timing of inward and outward cash flows, the level of interest rates, and changes in overall asset allocation. net investment income increased 8.3 percent in 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to higher reinvestment rates on fixed maturities, offset by reduced call activity in fixed income securities, and lower income from equity securities and private equities. refer to note 1 e) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. for private equities where we own less than three percent, investment income is included within net investment income in the table above. for private equities where we own more than three percent, investment income is included within other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. excluded from net investment income is the mark-to-market movement for private equities, which is recorded within either other income (expense) or net realized gains (losses) based on our percentage of ownership. the total mark-to-market movement for private equities excluded from net investment income was as follows: (in millions of u.s. dollars) 2022 2021

fourth quarter of 2021. additionally, interest expense in 2022 includes interest on $2.0 billion of repurchase agreements issued during the second quarter of 2022 which expired prior to december 31, 2022. pre-tax interest expense is expected to total $602 million for 2023 based on our existing debt obligations, at current foreign exchange rates, fees from expected usage of certain facilities, including letters of credit, and interest on held collateral and repurchase agreements. interest on held collateral and repurchase agreements is expected to be higher as a result of rising interest rates. refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, under item 8, for more information. amortization of purchased intangibles and other amortization amortization of purchased intangibles amortization expense related to purchased intangibles was $285 million, $287 million, and $290 million for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. the amortization of

traded, investment grade, fixed income securities with an average credit quality of a/a as rated by the independent investment rating services standard and poor's (s&p)/ moody's investors service (moody's). the portfolio is externally managed by independent, professional investment managers and is broadly diversified across geographies, sectors, and issuers. other investments principally comprise direct investments, investment funds, and limited partnerships. we hold no collateralized debt obligations in our investment portfolio, and we provide no credit default protection. we have long-standing global credit limits for our entire portfolio across the organization. exposures are aggregated, monitored, and actively managed by our global credit committee, comprising senior executives, including our chief financial officer, our chief risk officer, our chief investment officer, and our treasurer. we also have well-established, strict contractual investment rules requiring managers to maintain highly diversified exposures to individual issuers and closely monitor investment manager compliance with portfolio guidelines. the average duration of our fixed income securities, including the effect of options and swaps, was 4.5 years and 4.1 years at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. we estimate that a 100 basis point (bps) increase in interest rates would reduce the valuation of our fixed income portfolio by approximately $4.4 billion at december 31, 2022. the following table shows the fair value and cost/amortized cost, net of valuation

diversified primarily in state general obligation bonds and essential service revenue bonds including education and utilities (water, power, and sewers). non-u.s. our exposure to the euro results primarily from chubb european group se which is headquartered in france and offers a broad range of coverages throughout the european union, central, and eastern europe. chubb primarily invests in euro denominated investments to support its local currency insurance obligations and required capital levels. chubb's local currency investment portfolios have strict contractual investment guidelines requiring managers to maintain a high quality and diversified portfolio to both sector and individual issuers. investment portfolios are monitored daily to ensure investment manager compliance with portfolio guidelines. our non-u.s. investment grade fixed income portfolios are currency-matched with the insurance liabilities of our non-u.s. operations. the average credit quality of our non-u.s. fixed income securities is a and 45 percent of our holdings are rated aaa or guaranteed by governments or quasi-government agencies. within the context of these investment portfolios, our government

and are monitored daily via an internal compliance system. we manage our indirect exposure using the same credit rating based investment approach. accordingly, we do not believe our indirect exposure is material. 70 the following table summarizes the fair value and amortized cost, net of valuation allowance, of our non-u.s. fixed income portfolio by country/sovereign for non-u.s. government

by foreign subsidiaries of u.s. corporations. below-investment grade corporate fixed income portfolio below-investment grade securities have different characteristics than investment grade corporate debt securities. risk of loss from default by the borrower is greater with below-investment grade securities. below-investment grade securities are generally unsecured and are often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer. also, issuers of below-investment grade securities usually have higher levels of debt and are more sensitive to adverse economic conditions, such as recession or increasing interest rates, than investment grade issuers. at december 31, 2022, our corporate fixed income investment portfolio included below-investment grade and non-rated securities which, in total, comprised approximately 16 percent of our fixed income portfolio. our below-investment grade and non-rated portfolio includes over 1,700 issuers, with the greatest single exposure being $152 million. we manage high-yield bonds as a distinct and separate asset class from investment grade bonds. the allocation to high-yield bonds is explicitly set by internal management and is targeted to securities in the upper tier of credit quality (bb/b). our minimum rating for initial purchase is bb/b. fifteen external investment managers are responsible for high-yield security selection and portfolio construction. our high-yield managers have a conservative approach to credit selection and very low historical default experience. holdings are highly diversified across industries and generally subject to a 1.5 percent issuer limit as a percentage of high-yield allocation. we monitor position limits daily through an internal compliance system. derivative and structured securities (e.g., credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations) are not permitted in the high-yield portfolio. 71 asbestos and environmental (a&e) asbestos and environmental (a&e) reserving considerations for asbestos, chubb faces claims relating to policies issued to manufacturers, distributors, installers, and other parties in the chain of commerce for asbestos and products containing asbestos. claimants will generally allege damages across an extended time period which may coincide with multiple policies covering a wide range of time periods for a single insured. environmental claims present exposure for remediation and defense costs associated with the contamination of property or bodily injury as a result of pollution. the following table presents count information for asbestos claims by causative agent and environmental claims by account, for direct policies only: asbestos (by causative agent) environmental (by account) 2022 2021 2022 2021 open at beginning of year

asbestos or environmental loss and allocated loss adjustment expense (alae) reserves by the average asbestos or environmental loss and alae payments for the three most recent calendar years (3-year survival ratio). the following table presents the gross and net 3-year survival ratios for asbestos and environmental loss and alae reserves: (in years) gross loss and alae reserves net loss and alae reserves asbestos 4.7 5.1 environmental 3.3 3.9 the survival ratios provide only a very rough depiction of reserves and are significantly impacted by a number of factors such as aggressive settlement practices, variations in gross to ceded relationships within the asbestos or environmental claims, and levels of coverage provided. therefore, we urge caution in using these very simplistic ratios to gauge reserve adequacy. 72 catastrophe management we actively monitor and manage our catastrophe risk accumulation around the world from natural perils, including setting risk limits based on probable maximum loss (pml), and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance, to ensure sufficient liquidity and capital to meet the expectations of regulators, rating agencies and policyholders, and to provide shareholders with an appropriate risk-adjusted return. chubb uses internal and external data together with sophisticated analytical, catastrophe loss and risk modeling techniques to ensure an appropriate understanding of risk, including diversification and correlation effects, across different product lines and territories. the table below presents our modeled pre-tax estimates of natural catastrophe pml, net of reinsurance, at december 31, 2022, and does not represent our expected catastrophe losses for any one year. modeled net probable maximum loss (pml) pre-tax worldwide (1) u.s.

3.0 % (1) worldwide aggregate is comprised of losses arising from tropical cyclones, convective storms, earthquakes, u.s. wildfires, and floods in the u.s., canada, and europe, and excludes \"non-modeled\" perils such as man-made and other catastrophe risk including pandemic. (2) u.s. hurricane losses include losses from wind, storm-surge, and related precipitation-induced flooding. (3) california earthquakes include the fire-following sub-peril. the pml for worldwide and key u.s. peril regions are based on our in-force portfolio at october 1, 2022, and reflect the april 1, 2022, reinsurance program (see global property catastrophe reinsurance program section) as well as inuring reinsurance protection coverages. these estimates assume that reinsurance recoverable is fully collectible. according to the model, for the 1-in-100 return period scenario, there is a one percent chance that our pre-tax annual aggregate losses incurred in any year from u.s. hurricane events could be in excess of $3,188 million (or 6.3 percent of our total shareholders' equity at december 31, 2022). effective december 31, 2022, our worldwide pmls include losses from floods in canada and europe. additionally, u.s. hurricane pmls include losses from hurricane related precipitation-induced flooding. the above estimates of chubb's loss profile are inherently uncertain for many reasons, including the following: •while the use of third-party modeling packages to simulate potential catastrophe losses is prevalent within the insurance industry, the models are reliant upon significant meteorology, seismology, and engineering assumptions to estimate catastrophe losses. in particular, modeled catastrophe events are not always a representation of actual events and ensuing additional loss potential; •there is no universal standard in the preparation of insured data for use in the models, the running of the modeling software, and interpretation of loss output. these loss estimates do not represent our potential maximum exposures and it is highly likely that our actual incurred losses would vary materially from the modeled estimates; •the potential effects of climate change add to modeling complexity; and •changing climate conditions could impact our exposure to natural catastrophe risks. published studies by leading government, academic and professional organizations combined with extensive research by chubb climate scientists reveal the potential for increases in the frequency and severity of key natural perils such as tropical cyclones, inland flood, and wildfire. to understand the potential impacts on the chubb portfolio, we have conducted stress tests on our peak exposure zone, namely in the u.s., using parameters outlined by the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) climate change 2021 report. these parameters consider the impacts of climate change and the resulting climate peril impacts over a timescale relevant to our business. the tests are conducted by adjusting our baseline view of risk for the perils of hurricane, inland flood, and wildfire in the u.s. to reflect increases in frequency and severity across the modeled domains for each of these perils. based on these tests against the chubb portfolio we do not expect material impacts to our baseline pmls from climate change over the next 12 months. these tests reflect current exposures only and exclude potentially mitigating factors such as changes to building codes, public or private risk mitigation, regulation, and public policy. man-made and other catastrophes we have substantial exposure to losses resulting from man-made catastrophes including terrorism, cyber-attack, financial events, and other catastrophe events, including pandemics. these events are inherently unpredictable and could impact a variety of our businesses, including commercial and personal lines, life insurance, a&h, and reinsurance products. our losses from these events could be substantial. terrorism we offer terrorism coverage in the u.s. and in many other countries through various insurance products. we actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures through set risk limits based on modeled losses from certain terrorism attack scenarios, the purchase of reinsurance, and the reliance on government-sponsored terrorism reinsurance programs. in the u.s., certain protections of our terrorism exposure are provided through the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2019 (tripra). in 2022, tripra covers 80 percent of insured losses above a deductible, estimated to be approximately $3.0 billion. refer to \"global property catastrophe reinsurance program\" for information on our reinsurance protection purchased. at our largest exposure location in the u.s., our maximum modeled losses from a 10-ton truck-bomb explosion are estimated to be $1.9 billion pre-tax based on the exposures, net of reinsurance and tripra as of december 31, 2022. cyber insurance while frequency and severity trends are being managed through long-standing underwriting strategies, the potential catastrophe risk that aggregation of cyber exposures presents to insurers is unique and unprecedented. in contrast with natural catastrophe risks, catastrophic cyber event scenarios are not bound by time or geography. further, catastrophic cyber perils do not have well-established definitions or fundamental physical properties. for these reasons, catastrophic cyber events have the inherent potential for significant economic loss. although cyber risk does not represent a material component of our net premiums written and we engage in significant risk mitigation through our underwriting and use of reinsurance, we are exposed to material losses in the event of a systemic cyber-attack. financial risk the consequences of adverse global or regional market and economic conditions may affect our investment portfolio. our investment portfolio is subject to credit or default risk and may also be less liquid in times of economic weakness or market disruptions. our investments are subject to market risks and risks inherent in individual securities. our investment performance is highly sensitive to many factors, including interest rates, inflation, monetary and fiscal policies, and domestic and international political conditions. the volatility of our losses may force us to liquidate securities, which may cause us to incur capital losses. realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio would reduce our book value, and if significant, can affect our ability to conduct business. moreover, we have substantial exposure to insurance products which are sensitive to certain system-wide financial conditions, such as our financial lines, surety, political risk, involuntary loss of employment (outside u.s.), and trade credit products. these products tend to be characterized by infrequent but potentially high severity losses. the majority of our exposure in these products may be impacted by an adverse economic climate such as an economic recession or depression. if the financial condition of these insureds were adversely affected by the economy or otherwise, we may experience an increase in filed claims and may incur high severity losses, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. we monitor credit exposures to single counterparties and to sectors of interest from sources across our operations (e.g. investments, insurance products, reinsurance recoverable, bank deposits, letters of credit) and establish guidelines for credit risk exposure at the counterparty level. our net income may be volatile because certain variable annuity reinsurance products sold expose us to reserve and fair value liability changes that are directly affected by market and other factors and assumptions. pandemic an outbreak of pandemic disease, such as the covid-19 pandemic, could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations. the vast majority of our property and liability coverages do not provide coverage for pandemic claims. however, we are subject to the potential of aggregation of loss from coverages provided in our life, a&h, and workers' compensation portfolios. we assess our direct pandemic exposure using stress scenarios that consider mortality, morbidity, and other causes of insured loss such as trip cancellation. our assessment also incorporates the impact of a severe economic downturn which, as stated above under financial risk, includes an adverse impact to our investment portfolio and to our insurance products sensitive to certain system-wide financial conditions. global property catastrophe reinsurance program chubb's core property catastrophe reinsurance program provides protection against natural catastrophes impacting its primary property operations (i.e., excluding our global reinsurance and life insurance segments). we regularly review our reinsurance protection and corresponding property catastrophe exposures. this may or may not lead to the purchase of additional reinsurance prior to a program's renewal date. in addition, prior to each renewal date, we consider how much, if any, coverage we intend to buy and we may make material changes to the current structure in light of various factors, including modeled pml assessment at various return periods, reinsurance pricing, our risk tolerance and exposures, and various other structuring considerations. chubb renewed its global property catastrophe reinsurance program for our north american and international operations effective april 1, 2022, through march 31, 2023, with no material changes in coverage to the expired program. the program consists of three layers in excess of losses retained by chubb on a per occurrence basis. in addition, chubb renewed its terrorism coverage (excluding nuclear, biological, chemical and radiation coverage, with an inclusion of coverage for biological and chemical coverage for personal lines) for the united states from april 1, 2022, through march 31, 2023, with the same limits and retention and percentage placed except that the majority of terrorism coverage is on an aggregate basis above our retentions without a reinstatement. loss location layer of loss comments notes united states $0 million - $1.0

(sovereign), and through a unit of our london-based cgm operation. chubb is one of the world's leading underwriters of political risk and credit insurance, has a global portfolio spread across more than 150 countries and is also a member of the berne union. our clients include financial institutions, national export credit agencies, leading multilateral agencies, private equity firms and multinational corporations. cgm writes political risk and credit insurance business out of underwriting offices in london, united kingdom; hamburg, germany; sao paulo, brazil; singapore; tokyo, japan; and in the u.s. in the following locations: chicago, new york, los angeles and washington, d.c. our political risk insurance products provide protection to commercial lenders against defaults on cross border loans, cover investors against equity losses, and protect exporters against defaults on contracts. commercial lenders, our largest client segment, are covered for missed scheduled loan repayments due to acts of confiscation, expropriation or nationalization by the host government, currency inconvertibility or exchange transfer restrictions, or war or other acts of political violence. in addition, in the case of loans to government-owned entities or loans that have a government guarantee, political risk policies cover scheduled payments against risks of non-payment or non-honoring of government guarantees. private equity investors and corporations cover their equity investments against financial losses, such as expropriatory events, inability to repatriate dividends, and physical damage to their operations caused by covered political risk events. our export contracts product provides coverage for both exporters and their financing banks against the risk of contract frustration due to government actions, including non-payment by governmental entities. cgm's credit insurance businesses cover losses due to insolvency, protracted default, and political risk perils including export and license cancellation. our credit insurance product provides coverage to larger companies that have sophisticated credit risk management systems, with exposure to multiple customers and that have the ability to self-insure losses up to a certain level through excess of loss coverage. it also provides coverage to trade finance banks, exporters, and trading companies, with exposure to trade-related financing instruments. cgm also has limited capacity for specialist credit insurance products which provide coverage for project finance and working capital loans for large corporations and banks. we have implemented structural features in our policies in order to control potential losses within the political risk and credit insurance businesses. these include basic loss sharing features such as co-insurance and deductibles and, in the case of trade credit, the use of non-qualifying losses that drop smaller exposures deemed too difficult to assess. ultimate loss severity is also limited by using waiting periods to enable the insurer and insured to mitigate losses and to agree on recovery strategies if a claim does materialize. we have the option to pay claims over the original loan repayment schedule, rather than in a lump sum, in order to provide insureds and the insurer additional time to remedy problems and work towards full recoveries. it is important to note that political risk and credit policies are named peril conditional insurance contracts, not financial guarantees, and claims are only paid after conditions and warranties are fulfilled. political risk and credit insurance policies do not cover currency devaluations, bond defaults, movements in overseas equity markets, transactions deemed illegal, situations where corruption or misrepresentation has occurred, or debt that is not legally enforceable. in addition to assessing and mitigating potential exposure on a policy-by-policy basis, we also have specific risk management measures in place to manage overall exposure and risk. these measures include placing country, credit, and individual transaction limits based on country risk and credit ratings, combined single loss limits on multi-country policies, the use of quota share and excess of loss reinsurance protection as well as quarterly modeling and stress-testing of the portfolio. we have a dedicated country and credit risk management team that is responsible for the portfolio. crop insurance we are, and have been since the 1980s, one of the leading writers of crop insurance in the u.s. and have conducted that business through a managing general agent subsidiary of rain and hail. we provide protection throughout the u.s. on a variety of crops and are therefore geographically diversified, which reduces the risk of exposure to a single event or a heavy accumulation of losses in any one region. given its concentration of risk exposed to temperature, moisture, drought, hail and the more frequent and severe storms associated with climate change, crop insurance is a business with catastrophe-like features. our crop insurance business comprises two components - multiple peril crop insurance (mpci) and crop-hail insurance. the mpci program, offered in conjunction with the u.s. department of agriculture's risk management agency (rma), is a federal subsidized insurance program that covers revenue shortfalls or production losses due to natural causes such as drought, excessive moisture, hail, wind, freeze, insects, and disease. these revenue products are defined as providing both commodity price and yield coverages. policies are available for various crops in different areas of the u.s. and generally have deductibles ranging from 10 percent to 50 percent of the insured's risk. the usda's risk management agency (rma) sets the policy terms and conditions, rates and forms, and is also responsible for setting compliance standards. as a participant in the mpci program, we report all details of policies to the rma and are party to a standard reinsurance agreement (sra). the sra sets out the relationship between private insurance companies and the federal crop insurance corporation (fcic) concerning the terms and conditions regarding the risks each will bear including the pro-rata and state stop-loss provisions, which allows companies to limit the exposure of any one state or group of states on their underwriting results. in addition to the pro-rata and excess of loss reinsurance protections inherent in the sra, we purchase third-party proportional and stop-loss reinsurance for our mpci business to reduce our exposure. we may also enter into crop derivative contracts to further manage our risk exposure. each year the rma issues a final sra for the subsequent reinsurance year (i.e., the 2023 sra covers the 2023 reinsurance year from july 1, 2022 through june 30, 2023). there were no significant changes in the terms and conditions from the 2022 sra and therefore, the new sra does not impact chubb's outlook on the crop program relative to 2023. we recognize net premiums written as soon as estimable on our mpci business, which is generally when we receive acreage reports from the policyholders on the various crops throughout the u.s. this allows us to best determine the premium associated with the liability that is being planted. the mpci program has specific timeframes as to when producers must report acreage to us and in certain cases, the reporting occurs after the close of the respective reinsurance year. once the net premium written has been recorded, the premium is then earned over the growing season for the crops. a majority of the crops that are covered in the program are typically subject to the sra in effect at the beginning of the year. given the major crops covered in the program, we typically see a substantial written and earned premium impact in the second and third quarters. the pricing of mpci premium is determined using a number of factors including commodity prices and related volatility (i.e., both impact the amount of premium we can charge to the policyholder). for example, in most states, the pricing for the mpci revenue product for corn (i.e., insurance coverage for lower than expected crop revenue in a given season) includes a factor based on the average commodity price in february. if corn commodity prices are higher in february, compared to the february price in the prior year, and all other factors are the same, the increase in price will increase the corn premium year-over-year. pricing is also impacted by volatility factors, which measure the likelihood commodity prices will fluctuate over the crop year. for example, if volatility is set at a higher rate compared to the prior year, and all other factors are the same, the premium charged to the policyholder will be higher year-over-year for the same level of coverage. losses incurred on the mpci business are determined using both commodity price and crop yield. with respect to commodity price, there are two important periods on a large portion of the business: the month of february when the initial premium base is set, and the month of october when the final harvest price is set. if the price declines from february to october, with yield remaining at normal levels, the policyholder may be eligible to recover on the policy. however, in most cases there are deductibles on these policies, therefore, the impact of a decline in price would have to exceed the deductible before a policyholder would be eligible to recover. we evaluate our mpci business at an aggregate level and the combination of all of our insured crops (both winter and summer) go into our underwriting gain or loss estimate in any given year. typically, we do not have enough information on the harvest prices or crop yield outputs to quantify the preliminary estimated impact to our underwriting results until the fourth quarter. our crop-hail program is a private offering. premium is earned on the crop-hail program over the coverage period of the policy. given the very short nature of the growing season, most crop-hail business is typically written in the second and third quarters and the recognition of earned premium is also more heavily concentrated during this timeframe. we use industry data to develop our own rates and forms for the coverage offered. the policy primarily protects farmers against yield reduction caused by hail and/or fire, and related costs such as transit to storage. we offer various deductibles to allow the grower to partially self-insure for a reduced premium cost. we limit our crop-hail exposures through the use of township liability limits and third-party reinsurance on our net retained hail business. liquidity liquidity is a measure of a company's ability to generate cash flows sufficient to meet short-term and long-term cash requirements. as a holding company, chubb limited possesses assets that consist primarily of the stock of its subsidiaries and other investments. in addition to net investment income, chubb limited's cash flows depend primarily on dividends and other statutorily permissible payments. historically, dividends and other statutorily permitted payments have come primarily from chubb's bermuda-based operating subsidiaries, which we refer to as our bermuda subsidiaries. our consolidated sources of funds consist primarily of net premiums written, fees, net investment income, and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. funds are used at our various companies primarily to pay claims, operating expenses, and dividends; to service debt; to purchase investments; and to fund acquisitions. we anticipate that positive cash flows from operations (underwriting activities and investment income) should be sufficient to cover cash outflows under most loss scenarios for the near term. should the need arise, we generally have access to capital markets and available credit facilities. refer to \"credit facilities\" below for additional information. our access to funds under the existing credit facility is dependent on the ability of the bank that is a party to the facility to meet its funding commitments. should our existing credit provider experience financial difficulty, we may be required to replace credit sources, possibly in a difficult market. if we cannot obtain adequate capital or sources of credit on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. to date, we have not experienced difficulty accessing our credit facility or establishing additional facilities when needed. to further ensure the sufficiency of funds to settle unforeseen claims, we hold certain invested assets in cash and short-term investments. in addition, for certain insurance, reinsurance, or deposit contracts that tend to have relatively large and reasonably predictable cash outflows, we attempt to establish dedicated portfolios of assets that are duration-matched with the related liabilities. with respect to the duration of our overall investment portfolio, we manage asset durations to both maximize return given current market conditions and provide sufficient liquidity to cover future loss payments. at december 31, 2022, the average duration of our fixed maturities (4.5 years) approximates the average expected duration of our insurance liabilities (4.0 years). despite our safeguards, if paid losses accelerate beyond our ability to fund such paid losses from current operating cash flows, we might need to either liquidate a portion of our investment portfolio or arrange for financing. potential events causing such a liquidity strain could include several significant catastrophes occurring in a relatively short period of time, large uncollectible reinsurance recoverables on paid losses (as a result of coverage disputes, reinsurers' credit problems, or decreases in the value of collateral supporting reinsurance recoverables) or increases in collateral postings under our variable annuity reinsurance business. because each subsidiary focuses on a more limited number of specific product lines than is collectively available from the chubb group of companies, the mix of business tends to be less diverse at the subsidiary level. as a result, the probability of a liquidity strain, as described above, may be greater for individual subsidiaries than when liquidity is assessed on a consolidated basis. if such a liquidity strain were to occur in a subsidiary, we could be required to liquidate a portion of our investments, potentially at distressed prices, as well as be required to contribute capital to the particular subsidiary and/or curtail dividends from the subsidiary to support holding company operations. the payment of dividends or other statutorily permissible distributions from our operating companies are subject to the laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction, as well as the need to maintain capital levels adequate to support the insurance and reinsurance operations, including financial strength ratings issued by independent rating agencies. during 2022, we were able to meet all our obligations, including the payments of dividends on our common shares, with our net cash flows. we assess which subsidiaries to draw dividends from based on a number of factors. considerations such as regulatory and legal restrictions as well as the subsidiary's financial condition are paramount to the dividend decision. chubb limited received dividends of $7.5 billion and $3.7 billion from its bermuda subsidiaries in 2022 and 2021, respectively. chubb limited received cash dividends of $32 million and $21 million and non-cash dividends of $348 million and $916 million from a swiss subsidiary in 2022 and 2021, respectively. chubb limited also received dividends of $134 million from its other international subsidiary in 2022. the u.s. insurance subsidiaries of chubb ina holdings inc. (chubb ina) may pay dividends, without prior regulatory approval, subject to restrictions set out in state law of the subsidiary's domicile (or, if applicable, commercial domicile). chubb ina's international subsidiaries are also subject to insurance laws and regulations particular to the countries in which the subsidiaries operate. these laws and regulations sometimes include restrictions that limit the amount of dividends payable without prior approval of regulatory insurance authorities. chubb limited received no dividends from chubb ina in 2022 and 2021. debt issued by chubb ina is serviced by statutorily permissible distributions by chubb ina's insurance subsidiaries to chubb ina as well as other group resources. chubb ina received dividends of $2.0 billion and $2.3 billion from its subsidiaries in 2022 and 2021, respectively. at december 31, 2022, the amount of dividends available to be paid to chubb ina in 2023 from its subsidiaries without prior approval of insurance regulatory authorities totals $3.1 billion. cash flows our insurance and reinsurance operations provide liquidity in that premiums are received in advance, sometimes substantially in advance, of the time claims are paid. generally, cash flows are affected by claim payments that, due to the nature of our operations, may comprise large loss payments on a limited number of claims and which can fluctuate significantly from period to period. the irregular timing of these loss payments can create significant variations in cash flows from operations between periods. for additional information regarding estimates of future claim payments over the next twelve months, refer to our discussion of cash requirements within \"capital resources\". sources of liquidity include cash from operations, routine sales of investments, and financing arrangements. the following is a discussion of our cash flows for 2022, 2021, and 2020. operating cash flows reflect net income for each period, adjusted for non-cash items and changes in working capital. operating cash flows were $11.2 billion in 2022, compared to $11.1 billion and $9.8 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. cash used for investing was $5.7 billion in 2022, compared to $6.7 billion and $7.5 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. cash used for investing in 2022 was primarily due to cash paid for the purchase of cigna's business in asia of $5.0 billion, net of cash acquired. excluding this, cash used for investing was lower by $6.0 billion compared to 2021, primarily from cash received from net sales of equity securities and fixed maturities of $1.8 billion compared to net purchases of $3.9 billion, primarily in fixed maturities. in addition, cash used for the acquisitions of huatai group ownership interest was lower by $1.0 billion, partially offset by higher private equity contributions, net of distributions received, of $582 million in 2022 compared to 2021. cash used for financing was $5.1 billion in 2022, compared to $4.4 billion and $2.1 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. the increase of $718 million in 2022 compared to 2021 is principally from repayment of long-term debt of $1.0 billion in the current year, compared to proceeds of $1.6 billion in the prior year, partially offset by lower common shares repurchased of $2.0 billion in 2022. refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on share repurchases. both internal and external forces influence our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. claim settlements, premium levels, and investment returns may be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions. in many cases, significant periods of time, ranging up to several years or more, may lapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us, and the settlement of the liability for that loss. we use repurchase agreements as a low-cost funding alternative. at december 31, 2022, there were $1.4 billion in repurchase agreements outstanding with various maturities over the next two months. in addition to cash from operations, routine sales of investments, and financing arrangements, we have agreements with a third-party bank provider which implemented two international multi-currency notional cash pooling programs to enhance cash management efficiency during periods of short-term timing mismatches between expected inflows and outflows of cash by currency. the programs allow us to optimize investment income by avoiding portfolio disruption. in each program, participating chubb entities establish deposit accounts in different currencies with the bank provider. each day the credit or debit balances in every account are notionally translated into a single currency (u.s. dollars) and then notionally pooled. the bank extends overdraft credit to all participating chubb entities as needed, provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in each pool at the end of each day is at least zero. actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between legal entities. chubb entities may incur overdraft balances as a means to address short-term liquidity needs. any overdraft balances incurred under this program by a chubb entity would be guaranteed by chubb limited (up to $300 million in the aggregate). our syndicated letter of credit facility allows for same day drawings to fund a net pool overdraft should participating chubb entities withdraw contributed funds from the pool. capital resources capital resources consist of funds deployed or available to be deployed to support our business operations. december 31 december 31 (in millions of u.s. dollars, except for percentages) 2022

are higher at december 31, 2022 compared to december 31, 2021 from the decline in shareholders' equity, principally reflecting net unrealized depreciation on investments in the current year compared to net unrealized appreciation in 2021. repurchase agreements are excluded from the table above and are disclosed separately from short-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets. the repurchase agreements are collateralized borrowings where we maintain the right and ability to redeem the collateral on short notice, unlike short-term debt which comprises the current maturities of our long-term debt instruments. chubb ina's $1.0 billion of 2.875 percent senior notes due november 2022 was paid upon maturity. refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for details about the debt issued and debt redeemed. we believe our financial strength provides us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain available funds externally through debt or equity financing on both a short-term and long-term basis. our ability to access the capital markets is dependent on, among other things, market conditions and our perceived financial strength. we have accessed both the debt and equity markets from time to time. we generally maintain the ability to issue certain classes of debt and equity securities via an unlimited securities and exchange commission (sec) shelf registration which is renewed every three years. this allows us capital market access for refinancing as well as for unforeseen or opportunistic capital needs. in october 2021, we filed a new shelf registration statement which allows us to issue an unlimited amount of certain classes of debt and equity from time to time, replacing the shelf registration statement that was filed in october 2018. this new shelf registration statement expires in october 2024. securities repurchases from time to time, we repurchase shares as part of our capital management program. on july 19, 2021, the board authorized a one-time incremental share repurchase program of up to $5.0 billion of chubb common shares effective through june 30, 2022. in may 2022, the board authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of chubb common shares effective through june 30, 2023, which is the only board authorization currently in effect. share repurchases may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, block trades, accelerated repurchases and/or through option or other forward transactions. in 2022, 2021, and 2020 we repurchased $3.0 billion, $4.9 billion, and $516 million, respectively, of common shares in a series of open market transactions under the board share repurchase authorizations at an average per share price of $201.96, $175.85, and $143.91, respectively. for the period january 1, 2023 through february 23, 2023, we repurchased 1,633,300 common shares for a total of $347 million in a series of open market transactions under the share repurchase program authorization. at february 23, 2023, $1.3 billion in share repurchase authorization remained through june 30, 2023. common shares our common shares had a par value of chf 24.15 each at december 31, 2022. as of december 31, 2022, there were 31,781,758 common shares in treasury with a weighted-average cost of $160.88 per share. under swiss law, dividends must be stated in swiss francs though dividend payments are made by chubb in u.s. dollars. at our may 2022 annual general meeting, our shareholders approved an annual dividend for the following year of up to $3.32 per share, expected to be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.83 per share after the annual general meeting by way of distribution from capital contribution reserves, transferred to free reserves for payment. the board will determine the record and payment dates at which the annual dividend may be paid until the date of the 2023 annual general meeting, and is authorized to abstain from distributing a dividend at its discretion. the first three quarterly installments each of $0.83 per share, have been distributed by the board as expected. at our may 2021 annual general meeting, our shareholders approved an annual dividend for the following year of up to $3.20 per share, which was paid in four quarterly installments of $0.80 per share at dates determined by the board after the annual general meeting by way of distribution from capital contribution reserves, transferred to free reserves for payment. dividend distributions on common shares amounted to chf 3.11 ($3.29) per share for the year ended december 31, 2022. refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our dividends. cash requirements our cash requirements within the next twelve months include claims payable to claimants and other routine obligations typical to our business. we also have commitments related to our limited partnerships as well as for the incremental ownership interests in huatai group. we expect the cash required to meet these obligations to be primarily generated through a combination of cash on hand, cash from operations, routine sales of investments, and financing arrangements. we believe these sources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months, while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes. we believe our financial strength provides us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain available funds externally through debt or equity financing on both a short-term and long-term basis, if necessary. at december 31, 2022, our long-term cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include: •gross loss payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts - we are obligated to pay claims under insurance and reinsurance contracts for specified loss events covered under those contracts. total cash requirements are not determinable from underlying contracts and must be estimated. gross loss payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are estimated at $76.4 billion with $21.7 billion estimated due over the next twelve months. these estimated gross loss payments are inherently uncertain and the amount and timing of actual loss payments are likely to differ from these estimates and the differences could be material. given the numerous factors and assumptions involved in both estimates of loss reserves and related estimates as to the timing of future loss payments, differences between actual and estimated loss payments will not necessarily indicate a commensurate change in ultimate loss estimates. refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. •estimated payments for future policy benefits and glb - total estimated payments for future policy benefits and glb are estimated at $35.9 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, with a total $2.5 billion estimated due over the next twelve months. these estimated payments, which are not determinable from the contracts, are gross of fees or premiums from the underlying contracts. these estimated payments are higher than the future policy benefits reserves and glb liability presented on our consolidated balance sheets which are discounted and are reflected net of fees and premiums due from the underlying contracts. the timing and amount of actual payments may vary from the estimates. refer to note 1 j) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. •short-term and long-term debt, trust preferred securities, and related interest payments - total obligations for short-term and long-term debt and trust preferred securities maturities are $15.0 billion with $0.5 billion due in march 2023. interest payments related to these obligations total $6.6 billion with $0.5 billion due over the next twelve months. these estimates are based on current exchange rates. refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. •commitments on invested assets - total obligations for commitments related to our invested assets are $8.2 billion with $1.7 billion due over the next twelve months. refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. •pending acquisition - cash requirements for pending incremental shares in huatai group are approximately $0.8 billion, based on current exchange rates, expected to be paid over the next twelve months. the timing of completion is contingent upon important conditions. refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. •deposit liabilities - total obligations for deposit liabilities, including contract holder deposit funds, are $2.6 billion with $102 million due over the next twelve months. refer to note 1 l) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. •repurchase agreements - we use repurchase agreements as a low-cost funding alternative. at december 31, 2022, there were $1.4 billion in repurchase agreements outstanding with various maturities over the next two months. refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. •operating leases - total obligations for operating leases are $754 million with $160 million estimated due over the next twelve months. refer to note 10 j) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. as of december 31, 2022, we entered into two separate leases for office space that are not yet recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and are not included in the total obligations referenced above. the leases are expected to commence in 2023 and 2025 with initial terms of approximately 21 years and 23 years, respectively. total cash requirements are estimated at approximately $1.2 billion over the terms of these two leases. ratings chubb limited and its subsidiaries are assigned credit and financial strength (insurance) ratings from internationally recognized rating agencies, including s&p, a.m. best, moody's, and fitch. the ratings issued on our companies by these agencies are announced publicly and are available directly from the agencies. our internet site (investors.chubb.com, under financials/financial strength rating) also contains some information about our ratings, but such information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this report. financial strength ratings reflect the rating agencies' opinions of a company's claims paying ability. independent ratings are one of the important factors that establish our competitive position in the insurance markets. the rating agencies consider many factors in determining the financial strength rating of an insurance company, including the relative level of statutory surplus necessary to support the business operations of the company. these ratings are based upon factors relevant to policyholders, agents, and intermediaries and are not directed toward the protection of investors. such ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities. credit ratings assess a company's ability to make timely payments of principal and interest on its debt. it is possible that, in the future, one or more of the rating agencies may reduce our existing ratings. if one or more of our ratings were downgraded, we could incur higher borrowing costs, and our ability to access the capital markets could be impacted. in addition, our insurance and reinsurance operations could be adversely impacted by a downgrade in our financial strength ratings, including a possible reduction in demand for our products in certain markets. also, we have insurance and reinsurance contracts which contain rating triggers. in the event the s&p or a.m. best financial strength ratings of chubb fall, we may be faced with the cancellation of premium or be required to post collateral on our underlying obligation associated with this premium. information provided in connection with outstanding debt of subsidiaries chubb ina holdings inc. (subsidiary issuer) is an indirect 100 percent-owned and consolidated subsidiary of chubb limited (parent guarantor). the parent guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees certain of the debt of the subsidiary issuer. the following table presents the condensed balance sheets of chubb limited and chubb ina holdings inc., after elimination of investment in any non-guarantor subsidiary: chubb limited chubb ina holdings inc.

organizational resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” (vogus & sutcliffe, 2007: 3418). organizational resilience is defined as the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity. resilience can be defined as the system’s ability to maintain its integrity and its performance, at least partially, while under internal or external variations and disturbances (i.e. pressures, constraints, failures, errors, violations, hazards), whether nominal, extreme, or exceptional. defined as a company’s ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from a challenging situation. we develop a trajectory model of organizational resilience that focuses on how actors project temporal trajectories of responses toward disruptive events, reconstitute the trajectories in immediate response to the event, and reconfigure the trajectories toward the ensuing future. the concept of resilience draws attention to systems as well as individuals, to partial maintenance of integrity and performance, to the opposite of brittleness, and to disturbances that vary both in scale and source. resilience is a multifaceted concept that reflects businesses’ ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change to survive, grow, and flourish.\"\"\"\n\n    Text:\n    \"\"\"item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations (amounts in millions, except per share, share, membership fee, and warehouse count data) the following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is intended to promote understanding of the results of operations and financial condition. md&a is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k). this section generally discusses the results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021. for discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for 2021 compared to 2020 refer to part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our fiscal year 2021 form 10-k, which was filed with the united states securities and exchange commission (sec) on october 6, 2021. overview we believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales. net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and other businesses (e-commerce, business centers, travel and other). we define comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to our international operations); inflation and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions. the higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage our sg&a expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the united states. net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. while we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items, and through online offerings. our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. we do not focus in the short-term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our \"pricing authority\" - consistently providing the most competitive values. merchandise costs in 2022 were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years. the impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. those strategies can include, but are not limited to, working with our suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases, earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes, offering seasonal merchandise outside its season, as well as passing cost increases on to our members. our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). we believe our gasoline business enhances traffic in our warehouses, but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. it also has lower sg&a expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. a higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near- term net sales growth. generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales. a decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. additionally, actions in various countries, particularly china and the united states, have affected the costs of some of our merchandise. the degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. higher tariffs could adversely impact our results. we also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. as our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. the negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse operations. e-commerce sales growth slowed in 2022 compared to 2021 and 2020. the membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. this format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. the extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets. our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. while we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. with respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. this may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costs and sg&a expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income. our operating model is generally the same across our u.s., canadian, and other international operating segments (see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report). certain operations in the other international segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack e-commerce or business delivery. in discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, which are the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into u.s. dollars. this impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period. our fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to august 31. references to 2022, 2021, and 2020 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended august 28, 2022, august 29, 2021, and august 30, 2020, respectively. certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to costco. highlights for 2022 versus 2021 include: •we opened 26 new warehouses, including 3 relocations: 14 net new in the u.s., 2 net new in our canadian segment, and 7 new in our other international segment, compared to 22 new warehouses, including 2 relocations in 2021; •net sales increased 16% to $222,730 driven by a 14% increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses opened in 2021 and 2022; •membership fee revenue increased 9% to $4,224, driven by new member sign-ups, upgrades to executive membership, and an increase in our renewal rate; •gross margin percentage decreased 65 basis points, driven primarily by our core merchandise categories and a lifo charge for higher merchandise costs; •sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 77 basis points, primarily due to leveraging increased sales and ceasing of incremental wages related to covid-19, despite additional wage and benefits increases; •we incurred a one-time $77 pretax charge, primarily related to granting our employees one additional day of paid time off in march 2022; •the effective tax rate in 2022 was 24.6% compared to 24.0% in 2021; •net income increased 17% to $5,844, or $13.14 per diluted share compared to $5,007, or $11.27 per diluted share in 2021; •in june 2022, the company paid a cash dividend of $208 and purchased the remaining equity interest of its taiwan operations from its former joint-venture partner for $842, totaling $1,050 in the aggregate; and •in april 2022, the board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.79 to $0.90 per share. covid-19 the covid-19 pandemic continued to impact our business during 2022, albeit to a lesser extent. covid-related and other supply and logistics constraints have continued to adversely affect some merchandise categories and are expected to do so for the foreseeable future. during 2021, we paid $515 in incremental wages related to covid-19, which ceased in february 2021. results of operations net sales 2022 2021 2020 net sales $222,730 $192,052 $163,220 increases in net sales: u.s. 17 % 16 % 9 % canada 16 % 22 % 5 % other international 10 % 23 % 13 % total company 16 % 18 % 9 % increases in comparable sales: u.s. 16 % 15 % 8 % canada 15 % 20 % 5 % other international

international 10 % 13 % 11 % total company 11 % 13 % 9 % net sales net sales increased $30,678 or 16% during 2022. the improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales of 14%, and sales at new warehouses opened in 2021 and 2022. sales increased $15,830 in core merchandise categories and $14,848 in warehouse ancillary and other businesses. the rate of increase was strongest in our gasoline, business centers, and travel businesses. sales continued to be impacted by inflation, higher than what we experienced in previous fiscal years. during 2022, higher gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by $9,230, 481 basis points, compared to 2021, with a 42% increase in the average price per gallon. the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 22%, positively impacting net sales by $3,847, 200 basis points. changes in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $1,762, 92 basis points, compared to 2021, attributable primarily to our other international operations. comparable sales comparable sales increased 14% during 2022 and were positively impacted by increases in shopping frequency and average ticket, which includes the effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency. e-commerce comparable sales increased 10% during 2022, including inflation. membership fees 2022 2021 2020 membership fees $4,224 $3,877 $3,541 membership fees increase 9 % 9 % 6 % membership fee revenue increased 9% in 2022, driven by new member sign-ups and upgrades to executive membership. changes in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar negatively impacted membership fees by $42, compared to 2021. at the end of 2022, our member renewal rates were 93% in the u.s. and canada and 90% worldwide. renewal rates continue to benefit from more members auto renewing and increased penetration of executive members, who on average renew at a higher rate. our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of business members, is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. we account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. gross margin 2022 2021 2020 net sales $222,730 $192,052 $163,220 less merchandise costs 199,382 170,684 144,939 gross margin $23,348 $21,368 $18,281 gross margin percentage 10.48 % 11.13 % 11.20 % total gross margin percentage decreased 65 basis points compared to 2021. excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, gross margin was 10.94%, a decrease of 19 basis points. this was primarily due to a 33 basis-point decrease in core merchandise categories, predominantly driven by decreases in fresh foods and foods and sundries, and 19 basis points due to a lifo charge for higher merchandise costs. gross margin was also negatively impacted by one basis point due to increased 2% rewards. warehouse ancillary and other businesses positively impacted gross margin by 29 basis points, predominantly gasoline, partially offset by e-commerce. gross margin was positively impacted by five basis points due to the net impact of ceasing incremental wages related to covid-19 and the negative impact of a one-time charge related to granting our employees one additional day of paid time off. changes in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $176, compared to 2021, primarily attributable to our other international operations. the gross margin in core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), decreased 27 basis points. the decrease was across all categories, most significantly in fresh foods. this measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses. gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), decreased across all segments. all segments were negatively impacted due to decreases in core merchandise categories, partially offset by increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses. gross margin in our u.s. segment was also negatively impacted by the lifo charge. our other international segment was negatively impacted by increased 2% rewards. all segments benefited from the ceasing of incremental wages related to covid-19. selling, general and administrative expenses 2022 2021 2020 sg&amp;a expenses $19,779 $18,537 $16,387 sg&amp;a expenses as a percentage of net sales 8.88 % 9.65 % 10.04 % sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 77 basis points compared to 2021. sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation was 9.26%, a decrease of 39 basis points. warehouse operations and other businesses were lower by 17 basis points, largely attributable to leveraging increased sales. this includes the impact of the starting wage increase we instituted in october 2021, as well the increased wages and benefits that were effective on march 14, 2022, and july 4, 2022. sg&a expenses was benefited by a net of 16 basis points due to the positive impact of ceasing incremental wages related to covid-19, partially offset by higher write-offs of certain information technology assets, and expenses related to granting our employees one additional day of paid time off. central operating costs were lower by five basis points, and stock compensation expense was lower by one basis point. changes in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar decreased sg&a expenses by approximately $148, compared to 2021, primarily attributable to our other international operations. interest expense 2022 2021 2020 interest expense $158 $171 $160 interest expense primarily relates to senior notes and financing leases. interest expense decreased in 2022 due to repayment of the 2.300% senior notes on december 1, 2021. for more information on our debt arrangements, refer to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report. interest income and other, net 2022 2021 2020 interest income $61 $41 $89 foreign-currency transaction gains, net 106 56 7 other,

$1,308 effective tax rate 24.6 % 24.0 % 24.4 % the effective tax rate for 2022 was impacted by net discrete tax benefits of $130. this included $94 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. excluding discrete net tax benefits, the tax rate was 26.2% for 2022. the effective tax rate for 2021 was impacted by net discrete tax benefits of $163. this included $75 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation, $70 related to the special cash dividend paid through our 401(k) plan, and $19 related to a reduction in the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. excluding net discrete tax benefits, the tax rate was 26.4% for 2021. liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: 2022 2021 2020 net cash provided by operating activities $7,392 $8,958 $8,861 net cash used in investing activities (3,915) (3,535) (3,891) net cash used in financing activities (4,283) (6,488) (1,147) our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $11,049 and $12,175 at the end of 2022 and 2021, respectively. of these balances, unsettled credit and debit card receivables represented approximately $2,010 and $1,816 at the end of 2022 and 2021. these receivables generally settle within four days. changes in foreign exchange rates impacted cash and cash equivalents negatively by $249 in 2022, and positively by $46 and $70 in 2021 and 2020. material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of purchase obligations, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases, and construction and land purchase obligations. see notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for amounts outstanding on august 28, 2022, related to debt and leases. purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to merchandise, equipment, and third-party services, the majority of which are due in the next 12 months. construction and land purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to the development and opening of new and relocated warehouses, the majority of which (other than leases) are due in the next 12 months. management believes that our cash and investment position and operating cash flows with capacity under existing and available credit agreements will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. we believe that our u.s. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our u.s. liquidity requirements. cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities totaled $7,392 in 2022, compared to $8,958 in 2021. our cash flow provided by operations is primarily from net sales and membership fees. cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to merchandise suppliers, warehouse operating costs, including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by 28 several factors, including how fast inventory is sold, the forward deployment of inventory to accelerate delivery times, payment terms with our suppliers, and early payments to obtain discounts from suppliers. cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities totaled $3,915 in 2022, compared to $3,535 in 2021, and is primarily related to capital expenditures. net cash flows from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments. capital expenditures our primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations, and working capital. in 2022, we spent $3,891 on capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend approximately $3,800 to $4,000 during fiscal 2023. these expenditures are expected to be financed with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. we opened 26 new warehouses, including three relocations, in 2022, and plan to open approximately up to 29 additional new warehouses, including four relocations, in 2023. there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs or based on the economic environment. cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities totaled $4,283 in 2022, compared to $6,488 in 2021. cash flows used in financing activities primarily related to the payment of dividends, payments to our former joint-venture partner for a dividend and the purchase of their equity interest in taiwan, totaling $1,050 in the aggregate, repayments of our 2.300% senior notes, repurchases of common stock, and withholding taxes on stock awards. stock repurchase programs during 2022 and 2021, we repurchased 863,000 and 1,358,000 shares of common stock, at average prices of $511.46 and $364.39, respectively, totaling approximately $442 and $495, respectively. these amounts may differ from the stock repurchase balances in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of each fiscal year. purchases are made from time-to-time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under sec rule 10b5-1. repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the washington business corporation act. the remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $2,808 at the end of 2022. dividends cash dividends declared in 2022 totaled $3.38 per share, as compared to $12.98 per share in 2021. dividends in 2021 included a special dividend of $10.00 per share, aggregating approximately $4,430. in april 2022, the board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.79 to $0.90 per share. bank credit facilities and commercial paper programs we maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. at august 28, 2022, we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $1,257. our international operations maintain $773 of this capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $176 is guaranteed by the company. short-term borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facilities were $88 and $41 at the end of 2022 and 2021. the company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $224. the outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of 2022 totaled $184, most of which were standby letters of credit that do not expire or have expiration dates within one year. the bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. the amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding. off-balance sheet arrangements in the opinion of management, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or financial statements. critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap) requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, and we continue to review and evaluate these estimates. for further information on significant accounting policies, see discussion in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report. insurance/self-insurance liabilities claims for employee health-care benefits, workers' compensation, general liability, property damage, directors' and officers' liability, vehicle liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks to seek to limit exposures arising from very large losses. we use different risk management mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, and participate in a reinsurance program. liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated by using historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. the costs of claims are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate as a result of inflation rates, regulatory or legal changes, and unforeseen developments in claims. while we believe our estimates are reasonable and provide for a certain degree of coverage to account for these variables, actual claims and costs could differ significantly from recorded liabilities. historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. recent accounting pronouncements we do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a

organizational resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” (vogus & sutcliffe, 2007: 3418). organizational resilience is defined as the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity. resilience can be defined as the system’s ability to maintain its integrity and its performance, at least partially, while under internal or external variations and disturbances (i.e. pressures, constraints, failures, errors, violations, hazards), whether nominal, extreme, or exceptional. defined as a company’s ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from a challenging situation. we develop a trajectory model of organizational resilience that focuses on how actors project temporal trajectories of responses toward disruptive events, reconstitute the trajectories in immediate response to the event, and reconfigure the trajectories toward the ensuing future. the concept of resilience draws attention to systems as well as individuals, to partial maintenance of integrity and performance, to the opposite of brittleness, and to disturbances that vary both in scale and source. resilience is a multifaceted concept that reflects businesses’ ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change to survive, grow, and flourish.\"\"\"\n\n    Text:\n    \"\"\"item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward-looking statements this annual report on form

fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021 in fiscal 2022, we delivered growth in total revenue and strong profitability in a challenging environment impacted by significant supply constraints, rising component and related costs, and the russia and ukraine war. we remain focused on delivering innovation across our technologies to assist our customers in executing on their digital transformations. we continue to be negatively impacted by supply constraints seen industry-wide due to component shortages. while we did see some easing of the supply constraints towards the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect the constraints to continue and the duration is uncertain. we have, and continue to take, multiple steps in order to mitigate the component shortages and deliver products to our customers. we continued to make progress in the transition of our business model delivering increased software and subscriptions. we remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, and we believe that we have made continued progress on our strategic priorities. we continue to operate in a challenging macroeconomic and highly competitive environment. while the overall environment remains uncertain, we continue to aggressively invest in priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term. total revenue increased by 3% compared with fiscal 2021. within total revenue, product revenue increased by 6% and service revenue decreased by 2%. fiscal 2022 had 52 weeks, compared with 53 weeks in fiscal 2021, thus our results for fiscal 2022 reflect one less week compared with fiscal 2021. in fiscal 2022, total software revenue was flat at $15.1 billion across all product areas and service. within total software revenue, subscription revenue increased 3%. total gross margin decreased by 1.5 percentage points. product gross margin decreased by 2.1 percentage points, largely driven by increased costs related to supply constraints and to a lesser extent, product mix, partially offset by favorable pricing. as a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, decreased by 1.3 percentage points. operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 1.3 percentage points. diluted earnings per share increased 13%, driven by an increase of 12% in net income and a decrease in diluted share count of 44 million shares. in terms of our geographic segments, revenue from the americas increased by $0.7 billion, emea revenue increased by $0.8 billion and revenue in our apjc segment increased by $0.3 billion. from a customer market standpoint, we experienced product revenue growth in the commercial, enterprise and service provider markets partially offset by a decline in the public sector market. from a product category perspective, total product revenue increased 6% year over year, driven by growth in revenue in secure, agile networks of 5%; internet for the future of 17%; end-to-end security of 9% and optimized application experiences of 11%; partially offset by a product revenue decline in collaboration of 5%. russia and ukraine war in march 2022, in connection with the russian invasion of ukraine, cisco announced its intention to stop business operations in russia and belarus for the foreseeable future. those operations in russia and belarus included sales, services and related support functions. further, on june 23, 2022, we announced that we will begin an orderly wind-down and exit of our business in russia and belarus. our business operations in russia, belarus and ukraine, collectively, comprised approximately 1% of our total revenue for the year ended july 31, 2021. russia and belarus, collectively, represented less than 0.1% of our total assets at the end of fiscal 2022. as a result of the war and the resulting events, we have not recognized revenue in these countries effective march 2022. the negative impact to total revenue was approximately $200 million for fiscal 2022, which includes committed revenue we would have otherwise recognized, charges for uncollectible receivables, and other items. further, we also assessed the risk to the recoverability of our assets and other potential financial exposures in these countries. we have reserved for the non-recoverability of substantially all of our assets in russia and belarus. as a result, we have recognized certain non-recurring charges of $91 million in cost of sales and operating expenses in fiscal 2022 related to non-recoverability of certain assets, special personnel-related charges in order to support impacted employees, and severance and other exit related costs. the ongoing effect of the russia and ukraine war are difficult to predict due to the other uncertainties identified in part i, item 1a. risk factors herein. fourth quarter snapshot for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, total revenue, product revenue and service revenue were each flat as compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. with regard to our geographic segment performance, on a year-over-year basis, revenue in emea increased by 8% offset by declines in americas and apjc by 3% and 2%, respectively. from a product category perspective, we experienced product revenue growth in collaboration; end-to-end security and optimized application experiences; partially offset by declines in secure, agile networks and internet for the future. total gross margin decreased by 2.3 percentage points, driven by higher component and commodity costs, in addition to higher freight and logistics costs related to supply constraints, partially offset by favorable pricing and product mix. as a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses collectively decreased by 1.2 percentage points. operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 1.0 percentage points. diluted earnings per share decreased by 4%, driven by a decrease in net income of 6% and a decrease in diluted share count of 101 million shares. strategy and priorities as our customers add billions of new connections to their enterprises, and as more applications move to a multicloud environment, the network becomes even more critical. our customers are navigating change at an unprecedented pace. in this dynamic environment, we believe their priorities are to reimagine applications, power hybrid work, transform infrastructure, and secure the enterprise. our strategy is to help our customers connect, secure, and automate to accelerate their digital agility in a cloud-first world. we are committed to driving a trusted customer experience, through our innovation, choice, and people. for a full discussion of our strategy and priorities, see \"item 1. business.\" other key financial measures the following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021 (in millions): fiscal 2022 fiscal 2021 cash and cash equivalents and investments $19,267 $24,518 cash provided by operating activities $13,226 $15,454 remaining performance obligations $31,539 $30,893 repurchases of common stock-stock repurchase program $7,734 $2,902 dividends paid $6,224 $6,163 inventories $2,568 $1,559 critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. note 2 to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies. the inputs into certain of our judgments, assumptions, and estimates considered the economic implications of the covid-19 pandemic, including the associated impact of supply constraints, on our critical and significant accounting estimates. the covid-19 pandemic did not have a material impact on our significant judgments, assumptions and estimates that are reflected in our results for fiscal 2022. these estimates include: goodwill and identified purchased intangible assets and income taxes, among other items. the actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. as the covid-19 pandemic continues, many of our estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. as events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods. revenue recognition we enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. as a result, our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations. we determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. we classify our hardware, perpetual software licenses, and saas as distinct performance obligations. term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance. in transactions where we deliver hardware or software, we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis. we recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment, electronic delivery (or when the software is available for download by the customer), or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. our hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided. saas arrangements do not include the right for the customer to take possession of the software during the term, and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. on our product sales, we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. we record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes. revenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to for the promised goods or services based on standalone selling prices (ssp). ssp is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination. the best evidence of ssp is the observable price of a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. in instances where ssp is not directly observable, we determine ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. we assess relevant contractual terms in our customer contracts to determine the transaction price. we apply judgment in identifying contractual terms and determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. variable consideration includes potential contractual penalties and various rebate, cooperative marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors, channel partners and customers. when determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. we also consider the customers' right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable. if actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more details. inventory valuation and liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories, determined primarily by future demand forecasts. inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and net realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand, and are charged to the provision for inventory, which is a component of our cost of sales. at the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. we record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. our provision for inventory was $102 million, $116 million, and $74 million in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. the provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was $227 million, $76 million, and $139 million in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, or if supply constraints were to continue, we could be required to increase our inventory write-downs, and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, and accordingly our profitability, could be adversely affected. we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs, and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments. we continue to manage through significant supply constraints seen industry-wide due to component shortages caused, in part, by the covid-19 pandemic. for further discussion around the supply constraints impacts and risks, see \"-results of operations-gross margin-supply constraints impacts and risks\" and \"-liquidity and capital resources-inventory supply chain.\" loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. we consider the likelihood of the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. we regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required. third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the united states. if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairments our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. the assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets. in response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020. for the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2022, the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was $64.7 billion for the americas, $55.2 billion for emea, and $21.0 billion for apjc. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. the fair value of acquired technology and patents, as well as acquired technology under development, is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. the discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate. we consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications industry, and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets. we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. we review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. if the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. they can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. our impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets were $15 million for fiscal 2022. our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, r&d tax credits, foreign-derived intangible income deductions, global intangible low-taxed income, tax audit settlements, nondeductible compensation, and international realignments. our effective tax rate was 18.4%, 20.1%, and 19.7% in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties. significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to foreign-derived intangible income deduction, global intangible low-tax income and base erosion and anti-abuse tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules. significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. the oecd, an international association comprised of 38 countries, including the united states, has made changes and is contemplating additional changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. there can be no assurance that these changes and any contemplated changes if finalized, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates. our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. results of operations a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 is presented below. a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, with the exception of product revenue by category, for which is discussed herein, can be found under item 7 in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended july 31, 2021, filed with the sec on september 9, 2021. revenue the following table presents the breakdown of revenue between product and service (in millions, except percentages): years ended 2022 vs. 2021 july 30, 2022 july 31, 2021 july 25, 2020 variance in dollars variance in percent revenue: product $38,018 $36,014 $35,978 $2,004 6 % percentage of revenue 73.7

organized into three geographic segments. our revenue, which includes product and service for each segment, is summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages): years ended 2022 vs. 2021 july 30, 2022 july 31, 2021 july 25, 2020 variance in dollars variance in percent revenue: americas $29,814 $29,161 $29,291 $653 2 % percentage of revenue 57.8 % 58.5 % 59.4 % emea 13,715 12,951

percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. total revenue in fiscal 2022 increased by 3% compared with fiscal 2021. product revenue increased by 6% and service revenue decreased by 2%. our total revenue reflected growth across each of our geographic segments. in addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including the it spending environment and the level of spending by government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple performance obligations; the mix of financing arrangements provided to channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors. in addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment. product revenue by segment the following table presents the breakdown of product revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages): years ended 2022 vs. 2021 july 30, 2022 july 31, 2021 july 25, 2020 variance in dollars variance in percent product revenue: americas $21,620 $20,688 $21,006 $932 5 % percentage of product revenue 56.9 % 57.5 % 58.4 % emea 10,545

amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. americas product revenue in the americas segment increased by 5%. the product revenue increase was driven by growth in the service provider, commercial and enterprise markets, partially offset by a decline in the public sector market. from a country perspective, product revenue increased by 5% in the united states, 5% in canada and 7% in mexico, partially offset by a product revenue decrease of 1% in brazil. emea the increase in product revenue in the emea segment of 8% was driven by growth in the commercial, enterprise and service provider markets the public sector market was flat. from a country perspective, product revenue increased by 14% in the united kingdom and 9% in germany, partially offset by a decline of 3% in france. apjc product revenue in the apjc segment increased by 6%, driven by growth in the commercial and enterprise markets, partially offset by declines in the service provider and public sector markets. from a country perspective, product revenue increased by 18% in china and 10% in australia, partially offset by declines of 9% in japan and 1% in india. product revenue by category in addition to the primary view on a geographic basis, we also prepare financial information related to product categories and customer markets for various purposes. effective fiscal 2022, we began reporting our product revenue in the following categories: secure, agile networks; internet for the future; collaboration; end-to-end security; optimized application experiences; and other products. this change will better align our product categories with our strategic priorities. the following table presents product revenue by category (in millions, except percentages): years ended

percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. secure, agile networks fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021 the secure, agile networks product category represents our core networking offerings related to switching, enterprise routing, wireless, and compute. secure, agile networks revenue increased by 5%, or $1.1 billion, with growth across the portfolio except enterprise routing. revenue grew in both campus switching and data center switching, primarily driven by growth in our catalyst 9000 series, nexus 9000 series and meraki switching offerings. the decrease in enterprise routing was primarily driven by declines in our access and edge offerings. wireless had double-digit growth driven by our wifi-6 products and meraki offerings. revenue from compute grew primarily driven by our servers. fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 revenue from the secure, agile networks product category decreased by 2%, or $543 million, driven by declines across the portfolio with the exception of wireless. switching revenue declined in both campus switching and data center switching, although we had double-digit growth in our catalyst 9000 series and meraki switching offerings and growth in our nexus 9000 series. the decrease in enterprise routing was primarily driven by declines in our access offerings, partially offset by growth in our sd-wan and edge offerings. wireless had solid growth driven by our meraki offerings and the ramp of our wifi-6 products. revenue from compute declined primarily driven by our servers. internet for the future fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021 the internet for the future product category includes our routed optical networking, 5g, silicon and optics solutions. revenue in our internet for the future product category increased by 17%, or $764 million, driven by growth in the webscale provider market. we saw growth in our cisco 8000, ncs 5500 and asr 9000 series offerings, and also saw a benefit from our acquisition of acacia in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 revenue in our internet for the future product category increased 8%, or $334 million, driven by growth in our ncs 5500 series offerings and the ramp of our cisco 8000 series offerings. collaboration fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021 the collaboration product category consists of our meetings, collaboration devices, calling, contact center and cpaas offerings. revenue in our collaboration product category decreased 5%, or $255 million, with declines in our meetings, calling and contact center offerings, partially offset by the ramp in our cpaas offerings. fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 revenue in our collaboration product category decreased by 2%, or $96 million, with declines in our collaboration devices, partially offset by growth in our meetings, calling and contact center offerings. end-to-end security fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021 the end-to-end security product category consists of our network security, cloud security, security endpoints, unified threat management and zero trust offerings. revenue in our end-to-end security product category increased by 9%, or $317 million, primarily driven by growth in our zero trust portfolio, network security, unified threat management and security endpoint offerings. our zero trust portfolio reflected double-digit growth driven by continued momentum with our duo offerings. fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 revenue in our end-to-end security product category increased by 7%, or $224 million, primarily driven by growth in our cloud-based solutions and unified threat management offerings, partially offset by declines in our network security offerings. our zero trust portfolio reflected growth driven by our duo offerings. optimized application experiences fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021 the optimized application experiences product category includes our full stack observability and cloud-native platforms offerings. revenue in our optimized application experiences product category increased 11%, or $75 million, driven by growth in our thousandeyes and intersight offerings, partially offset by a decline in our appdynamics offerings. fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 revenue in our optimized application experiences product category increased by 25%, or $130 million, driven by growth in our intersight offerings. we also had a benefit from our acquisition of thousandeyes. service revenue by segment the following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages): years ended 2022 vs. 2021 july 30, 2022 july 31, 2021 july 25, 2020 variance in dollars variance in percent service revenue: americas $8,194 $8,472 $8,285 $(278) (3) % percentage

15.2 % total $13,539 $13,804 $13,323 $(265) (2) % amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. service revenue decreased 2%, driven by declines in our maintenance business, advisory services and software support offerings, partially offset by growth in our solution support and network support offerings. the extra week in fiscal 2021 also contributed to the decrease in service revenue in fiscal 2022. service revenue decreased in the americas and apjc segments, partially offset by growth in the emea segment. gross margin the following table presents the gross margin for products and services (in millions, except percentages): amount percentage years ended july 30, 2022 july 31, 2021 july 25, 2020 july 30, 2022 july 31, 2021 july 25, 2020 gross margin: product $23,204 $22,714 $22,779 61.0 % 63.1 % 63.3 % service 9,044 9,180 8,904 66.8 % 66.5 % 66.8 % total $32,248 $31,894 $31,683 62.5 % 64.0 % 64.3 % product gross margin the following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2022: product gross margin percentage fiscal 2021 63.1 % productivity (1) (2.8) % product pricing 1.0 % mix of products sold (0.3) % others - % fiscal 2022 61.0 % (1) productivity includes overall manufacturing-related costs, such as component costs, warranty expense, provision for inventory, freight, logistics, shipment volume, and other items not categorized elsewhere. product gross margin decreased by 2.1 percentage points primarily driven by negative impacts from productivity, largely driven by increased costs related to supply constraints from freight, expedites, and higher component and commodity costs. these impacts were partially offset by favorable pricing. the benefit we saw from favorable pricing was primarily driven by price increases implemented during fiscal 2022, to partially offset increases in components and commodity costs, freight and logistics costs, driven by supply constraints. supply constraints impacts and risks we continue to manage through significant supply constraints seen industry-wide due to component shortages caused, in part, by the covid-19 pandemic, and for which the duration of such constraints is uncertain. these shortages have resulted in increased costs (i.e., component and other commodity costs, freight, expedite fees, etc.) which have had a negative impact on our product gross margin and have resulted in extended lead times for us and our customers. we have taken a number of steps in order to mitigate the supply constraint related impacts including: partnering with several of our key suppliers utilizing our volume purchasing ability and extending supply coverage, including, in certain cases, revising supplier arrangements; paying significantly higher component and logistics costs to secure supply; modifying our product designs in order to leverage alternate suppliers, where possible; and continually optimizing our inventory build and customer delivery plans, among others. we believe these actions are helping us to optimize our access to critical components and meet customer demand for our products. we continue to see solid demand across the majority of our portfolio. as a result, in order to secure supply to meet customer demand, we have increased our inventory balances, inventory purchase commitments, and inventory deposits and prepayments (see \"-liquidity and capital resources-inventory supply chain\"), which, in turn, has increased our supply chain exposure. additionally, in certain situations, we have prepaid or made deposits with suppliers to secure future supply. these actions significantly increase the risk of future material excess and obsolete inventory and related losses if customer demand were to suddenly and significantly decrease in future periods. while we believe we are taking the right strategic and operational actions to address the supply situation, we recognize the increased risks. service gross margin our service gross margin percentage increased by 0.3 percentage points primarily due to lower headcount-related and delivery costs and favorable mix of service offerings, partially offset by lower sales volume. our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business. other factors include the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services. gross margin by segment the following table presents the total gross margin for each segment (in millions, except percentages): amount percentage years ended july 30, 2022 july 31, 2021 july 25, 2020 july 30, 2022 july 31, 2021 july 25, 2020 gross margin: americas $19,117 $19,499 $19,547 64.1 % 66.9 % 66.7 % emea 8,969 8,466 8,304 65.4 % 65.4 % 65.6 % apjc 5,241 4,949 4,688 65.3 % 64.2 % 63.8 % segment total 33,326 32,914 32,538 64.6 % 66.1 % 66.0 % unallocated corporate items (1) (1,078) (1,020) (855) total $32,248 $31,894 $31,683 62.5 % 64.0 % 64.3 % (1) the unallocated corporate items include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, and certain other charges. we do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments. amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. we experienced a gross margin percentage decrease in our americas segment due to negative impacts from productivity and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by favorable pricing. gross margin in our emea segment was flat due to higher service gross margin, favorable product mix and favorable pricing offset by negative impacts from productivity. the apjc segment gross margin percentage increase was due to favorable product mix and favorable pricing, partially offset by negative impacts from productivity. the gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate, and period-to-period changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment. research and development (\"r&d\"), sales and marketing, and general and administrative (\"g&a\") expenses r&d, sales and marketing, and g&a expenses are summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages): years ended 2022 vs. 2021 july 30, 2022 july 31, 2021 july 25, 2020 variance in dollars variance in percent research and development $6,774 $6,549 $6,347 $225 3 % percentage of revenue 13.1 % 13.1 %

total $17,960 $17,960 $17,441 $- - % percentage of revenue 34.8 % 36.1 % 35.4 % our fiscal 2022 had one less week compared with fiscal 2021, which had an extra week. r&d expenses r&d expenses increased due to higher headcount-related expenses, higher share-based compensation expense, higher acquisition-related costs and higher contracted services spending, partially offset by lower discretionary spending. we continue to invest in r&d in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion. if we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products, we may purchase or license technology from other businesses, or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal r&d. sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses decreased primarily due to lower headcount-related expenses and lower contracted services spending, partially offset by higher discretionary spending, certain non-recurring charges recognized due to the russia and ukraine war and higher share-based compensation expense. the extra week in fiscal 2021 contributed to the decrease in headcount-related expenses. g&a expenses g&a expenses decreased due to lower contracted services spending, partially offset by certain non-recurring charges recognized due to the russia and ukraine war. effect of foreign currency in fiscal 2022, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased the combined r&d, sales and marketing, and g&a expenses by approximately $154 million, or 0.9%, compared with fiscal 2021. amortization of purchased intangible assets the following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets including impairment charges (in millions): years ended july 30, 2022 july 31, 2021 july 25, 2020 amortization of purchased intangible assets: cost of sales $749 $716 $659 operating expenses 328 215 141 total $1,077 $931 $800 the increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets was due largely to the amortization of purchased intangibles from our recent acquisitions and impairment charges of $15 million. the impairment charges were primarily due to declines in estimated fair value resulting from reductions in or the elimination of expected future cash flows associated with certain of our technology and in-process research and development (ipr&d) intangible assets. restructuring and other charges the following table presents restructuring and other charges (in millions): years ended july 30, 2022 july 31, 2021 july 25, 2020 restructuring and other charges included in operating expenses $6 $886 $481 we initiated a restructuring plan in fiscal 2021, which included a voluntary early retirement program, in order to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas. the total pretax charges were estimated to be approximately $900 million. we incurred cumulative charges of $892 million and completed this plan in fiscal 2022. operating income the following table presents our operating income and our operating income as a percentage of revenue (in millions, except percentages): years ended july 30, 2022 july 31, 2021 july 25, 2020 operating income $13,969 $12,833 $13,620 operating income as a percentage of revenue 27.1 % 25.8 % 27.6 % operating income increased by 9%, and as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 1.3 percentage points. these changes resulted primarily from a revenue increase and lower restructuring and other charges partially offset by a gross margin percentage decrease (driven by negative impacts from productivity partially offset by favorable pricing). 44 interest and other income (loss), net interest income (expense), net the following table summarizes interest income and interest expense (in millions): years ended 2022 vs. 2021 july 30, 2022 july 31, 2021 july 25, 2020 variance in dollars interest income $476 $618 $920 $(142) interest expense (360) (434) (585) 74 interest income (expense), net $116 $184 $335 $(68) interest income decreased driven by lower average book yields and lower average balances of cash and available-for-sale debt investments. the decrease in interest expense was driven by a lower average debt balance. other income (loss), net the components of other income (loss), net, are summarized as follows (in millions): years ended 2022 vs. 2021 july 30, 2022 july 31, 2021 july 25, 2020 variance in dollars gains (losses) on investments, net: available-for-sale debt investments $9 $53 $42 $(44) marketable equity investments (38) 6 (5) (44) privately held investments 486 266 95 220 net gains (losses) on investments 457 325 132 132 other gains (losses), net (65) (80) (117) 15 other income (loss), net $392 $245 $15 $147 the increase in our other income (loss), net was primarily driven by higher realized and unrealized gains on our privately held investments, and to a lesser extent, favorable impacts from foreign exchange. the increase was partially offset by changes in net gains (losses) on available-for-sale debt investments and marketable equity investments. provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 18.4% for fiscal 2022, compared with 20.1% for fiscal 2021. the net 1.7 percentage points decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in prior year discrete tax expenses and state taxes. for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the u.s. federal statutory rate of 21% and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes, see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. 45 liquidity and capital resources the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends, our contractual obligations, and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources. balance sheet and cash flows cash and cash equivalents and investments the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments (in millions): july 30, 2022 july 31, 2021 increase (decrease) cash and cash equivalents $7,079 $9,175 $(2,096) available-for-sale debt investments 11,947 15,206 (3,259) marketable equity securities 241 137 104 total $19,267 $24,518 $(5,251) the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by cash returned to stockholders in the form of repurchases of common stock of $7.7 billion under the stock repurchase program and cash dividends of $6.2 billion, net decrease in debt of $2.5 billion, changes in unrealized losses of our investments and other of $0.9 billion, net increase in restricted cash equivalents of $0.8 billion, capital expenditures of $0.5 billion and net cash paid for acquisitions and divestitures of $0.4 billion. these uses of cash were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $13.2 billion and issuance of commercial paper of $0.6 billion. we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. we classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. we believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below. securities lending we periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale debt investments. these transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis. we require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. we engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. we did not experience any losses in connection with the secured lending of securities during the periods presented. as of july 30, 2022 and july 31, 2021, we had no outstanding securities lending transactions. free cash flow and capital allocation as part of our capital allocation strategy, we target to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to our stockholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock. we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment. the following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions): years ended july 30, 2022 july 31, 2021 july 25, 2020 net cash provided by operating activities $13,226 $15,454 $15,426 acquisition of property and equipment (477) (692) (770) free cash flow $12,749 $14,762 $14,656 we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter (which we refer to as shipment linearity), the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables, inventory and supply chain management, deferred revenue and the timing and amount of tax and other payments. for additional discussion, see \"part i, item 1a. risk factors\" in this report. we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. we 46 further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting capital investments. a limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. in addition, we have other required uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do. the following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases (in millions, except per-share amounts): dividends stock repurchase program total years ended per share amount shares weighted-average price per share amount amount july 30, 2022 $1.50 $6,224 146 $52.82 $7,734 $13,958 july 31, 2021 $1.46 $6,163 64 $45.48 $2,902 $9,065 july 25, 2020 $1.42 $6,016 59 $44.36 $2,619 $8,635 on august 23, 2022, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.38 per common share to be paid on october 26, 2022, to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on october 5, 2022. any future dividends are subject to the approval of our board of directors. the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program is approximately $15.2 billion, with no termination date. accounts receivable, net the following table summarizes our accounts receivable, net (in millions): july 30, 2022 july 31, 2021 increase (decrease) accounts receivable, net $6,622 $5,766 $856 our accounts receivable net, as of july 30, 2022 increased by approximately 15% compared with the end of fiscal 2021, primarily due to timing and amount of product and service billings at the end of fiscal 2022 compared with the end of fiscal 2021. inventory supply chain the following table summarizes our inventories and inventory purchase commitments with

inventory balances at the end of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by 26% and 194% from our balances at the end of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. we increased our balances in inventories, inventory purchase commitments, and inventory deposits and prepayments as compared to prior fiscal years in order to address significant supply constraints seen industry-wide. the increases were primarily due to arrangements to secure supply and pricing for certain product components and commitments with contract manufacturers to meet customer demand and to address extended lead times, as well as advance payments with suppliers to secure future supply, as a result of the supply constraints. we have partnered with several of our key suppliers utilizing our volume purchasing and extending supply coverage, including revising supplier arrangements. as discussed, our risks of future material excess and obsolete inventory and related losses are further outlined in the result of operations-product gross margin section. we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. during the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity. our inventory purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. certain of our inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure supply and pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. a significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. in certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of supply constraints, rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. we believe the amount of our inventory and inventory purchase commitments is appropriate for our current and expected customer demand and revenue levels. financing receivables and guarantees the following table summarizes our financing receivables (in millions): july 30, 2022 july 31, 2021 increase (decrease) lease receivables, net $1,175 $1,697 $(522) loan receivables, net 4,556 5,117 (561) financed service contracts, net 2,183 2,450 (267) total, net $7,914 $9,264 $(1,350) financing receivables our financing arrangements include leases, loans, and financed service contracts. lease receivables include sales-type leases. arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. our loan receivables include customer financing for purchases of our hardware, software and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. we also provide financing to certain qualified customers for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services. the majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed. financing receivables decreased by 15%. financing guarantees in the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. the financing arrangements provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. in some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. the financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, with payment terms generally ranging from 60 to 90 days. in certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. the receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. the volume of channel partner financing was $27.9 billion, $26.7 billion, and $26.9 billion in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. these financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. the balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion as of july 30, 2022 and july 31, 2021, respectively. we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners. historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. in either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. as of july 30, 2022, the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately $179 million, of which approximately $9 million was recorded as deferred revenue. borrowings senior notes the following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes (in millions): maturity date july 30, 2022 july 31, 2021 senior notes: fixed-rate notes: 1.85%

senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of july 30, 2022. commercial paper we have a short-term debt financing program in which up to $10.0 billion is available through the issuance of commercial paper notes. we use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes. we had $0.6 billion in commercial paper notes outstanding as of july 30, 2022, and no commercial paper outstanding as of july 31, 2021. credit facility on may 13, 2021, we entered into a 5-year credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on may 13, 2026. as of july 30, 2022, we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants, and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit agreement. any advances under the 5-year credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (a) with respect to loans in u.s. dollars, (i) libor or (ii) the base rate (to be defined as the highest of (x) the bank of america prime rate, (y) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (z) a daily rate equal to one-month libor plus 1.0%), (b) with respect to loans in euros, euribor, (c) with respect to loans in yen, tibor and (d) with respect to loans in pounds sterling, sonia plus a credit spread adjustment, plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by standard & poor's financial services, llc and moody's investors service, inc., provided that in no event will the interest rate be less than 0.0%. we will pay a quarterly commitment fee during the term of the 5-year credit agreement which may vary depending on our senior debt credit ratings. in addition, the 5-year credit agreement incorporates certain sustainability-linked metrics. specifically, our applicable interest rate and commitment fee are subject to upward or downward adjustments if we achieve, or fail to achieve, certain specified targets based on two key performance indicator metrics: (i) social impact and (ii) foam reduction. we may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and, at our option, extend the maturity of the facility for an additional year up to two times. the credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement. remaining performance obligations the following table presents the breakdown of remaining performance obligations (in millions): july 30, 2022 july 31, 2021 increase (decrease) product $14,090 $13,270 $820 service 17,449 17,623 (174) total $31,539 $30,893 $646 short-term rpo $16,936 $16,289 $647 long-term rpo 14,603 14,604 (1) total $31,539 $30,893 $646 total remaining performance obligations increased 2% in fiscal 2022. remaining performance obligations for product increased 6% and remaining product obligations for service decreased 1%, compared to fiscal 2021. we expect approximately 54% of total remaining performance obligations to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. deferred revenue the following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue (in millions): july 30, 2022 july 31, 2021 increase (decrease) product $10,427 $9,416 $1,011 service 12,837 12,748 89 total $23,264 $22,164 $1,100 reported as: current $12,784 $12,148 $636 noncurrent 10,480 10,016 464 total $23,264 $22,164 $1,100 total deferred revenue increased 5% in fiscal 2022. the increase in deferred product revenue of 11% was primarily due to increased deferrals related to our recurring software offerings. the slight increase in deferred service revenue was driven by the impact of contract renewals, partially offset by amortization of deferred service revenue. contractual obligations the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously. in addition, we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process. the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at july 30, 2022 (in millions): payments due by period july 30, 2022 total less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years more than 5 years operating leases $1,127 $343 $431 $168 $185 purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers 12,964 9,954 2,240 770 - other purchase obligations

$6,258 $5,082 other long-term liabilities (uncertainty in the timing of future payments) 2,324 total $35,388 operating leases for more information on our operating leases, see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. our inventory purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. certain of our inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure supply and pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. a significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. we record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. see further discussion in \"inventory supply chain.\" other purchase obligations other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations. long-term debt the amount of long-term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. transition tax payable transition tax payable represents future cash tax payments associated with the one-time u.s. transition tax on accumulated earnings for foreign subsidiaries as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act (\"the tax act\"). other long-term liabilities other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately $2.3 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $55 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions. see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. other commitments in connection with our acquisitions, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. we also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our privately held investments, some of which may be based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones or are required to be funded on demand. the funding commitments were $0.4 billion and $0.2 billion as of july 30, 2022 and july 31, 2021, respectively. in the ordinary course of business, we have privately held investments and provide financing to certain customers. certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities. we evaluate on an ongoing basis our privately held investments and customer financings, and we have determined that as of july 30, 2022 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities. on an ongoing basis, we reassess our privately held investments and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. as a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events. we provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners. we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners. see the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under \"financing receivables and guarantees.\" liquidity and capital resource requirements while the covid-19 pandemic and the russia and ukraine war have not materially impacted our liquidity and capital resources to date, it has led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets. these events and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future. based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs (including inventory and other supply related payments), capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, pending acquisitions, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. we expect increased payments related to inventory and other supply related payments through at least the next 12 months. there are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for, capital resources.\"\"\"\n\n    Instruction:\n    Identify and summarize all sentences or phrases that are

$175 million, resulting in the recognition of a pre-tax gain of $137 million. enterprise priorities we aspire to move money and information in a way that moves the world. our purpose is to deliver superior value for our clients through leading technology, targeted innovation and excellence in everything we do. we are focused on driving growth and creating value by assembling a high-performing and diverse team, integrating our solutions, delivering operational excellence, allocating capital in a disciplined manner, including share repurchase and merger and acquisition activity, and delivering breakthrough innovation. our long-term priorities are to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our financial commitments; deepen client relationships with an emphasis on digital channels and payment solutions; deliver innovation and integration enabling differentiated value for our clients; and generate integration value, including cost and revenue synergies from acquisitions. industry trends the global payments landscape continues to evolve, with rapidly advancing technologies and a steady expansion of digital payments, e-commerce and real-time payments infrastructure. because of this growth, competition also continues to intensify. business and consumer expectations continue to rise, with a focus on speed, convenience, choice and security. to meet these expectations, payments companies are focused on modernizing their technology, expanding the use of data and enhancing the customer experience. merchants the rapid growth in and globalization of mobile and e-commerce, driven by consumers' desire for simpler, more efficient shopping experiences, has created an opportunity for merchants to reach consumers nearly anywhere, through any device, which often requires a merchant acquiring provider to enable and optimize the acceptance of payments. merchants are demanding simpler, integrated and flexible systems to accept payments and help manage their everyday business operations. when combined with the ever-increasing ways a consumer can pay for goods and services, merchants have sought modern systems to streamline the complexity. furthermore, merchants can now search, discover, compare, purchase and even install a new system through direct, digital-only experiences. this direct, digital-only channel is a source of new merchant acquisition opportunities, especially with respect to smaller merchants. additionally, there are numerous software-as-a-service (\"saas\") solution providers in the industry, many of which have chosen to integrate merchant acquiring into their software as a way to further monetize their client relationships. such providers are typically referred to as isvs, and we believe there are thousands of these potential distribution partnership opportunities available to us. we believe that our merchant acquiring products and solutions create compelling value propositions for merchant clients of all sizes, from small and mid-sized businesses to medium-sized regional businesses to global enterprise merchants, and across all verticals. furthermore, we believe that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with valued partnerships with merchant acquiring businesses of financial and non-financial institutions of all sizes, gives us a solid foundation for growth. financial institutions and other financial technology providers financial services providers regularly introduce and implement new payment, deposit, risk management, lending and investment products, and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions and other financial technology providers continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same customers. at the same time, the evolving global regulatory and cybersecurity landscape has continued to create a challenging operating environment for financial institutions. these conditions are driving heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers, generate incremental revenue, comply with regulations and enhance operating efficiency. in addition, the focus on the customer experience, including through mobile and online engagement, by both financial institutions and their customers, as well as the growing volume and types of payment transactions in the marketplace, continues to elevate the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions. we expect that financial institutions and other financial technology providers will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information, maintain regulatory compliance and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment. we anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes in an evolving marketplace. we believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments, and we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions, including a unified, seamless customer experience across mobile and online channels, will continue to increase, which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us. the number of financial institutions in the united states has declined at a relatively steady rate, primarily as a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions. rather than reducing the overall market, these consolidations transfer accounts among financial institutions. if a client loss occurs due to merger or acquisition, we typically receive a contract termination fee based on the size of the client and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated. these fees can vary from period to period with the variance depending on the quantum of financial institution merger activity in a given period and whether or not our clients are involved in the activity. our focus on long-term client relationships and recurring, transaction-oriented products and services has also reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us. we believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients by providing, among other things, new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce their costs. furthermore, we believe that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with our position as a leading provider of non-discretionary, recurring revenue-based products and services, gives us a solid foundation for growth. recent market conditions global macroeconomic conditions, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, inflation, disruptions in the global supply chain, the effects of the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine, the continuing impact of the coronavirus (\"covid-19\") pandemic, and regulations restricting trade or that impact our ability to offer products or services, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, since 2021, we have observed increased shortages and delays in the global supply chain for components and inputs necessary to our businesses, such as semiconductors, paper and plastic, and may experience difficulty procuring those components and inputs in the future on a timely basis or at historical prices. for discussion of risks related to potential impacts of supply chain, geopolitical and macroeconomic challenges on our business, results of operations and financial condition, see \"item 1a. risk factors.\" critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s., which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements, including for recently adopted accounting pronouncements, and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates. acquisitions from time to time, we make strategic acquisitions that may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. the estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. we use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. the determination of fair value requires estimates about discount rates, growth and retention rates, royalty rates, expected future cash flows and other future events that are judgmental in nature. while we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. as a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income. we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. additional information regarding our acquisitions is included in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. goodwill and intangible assets we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, which is one level below our reportable segments. when reviewing goodwill for impairment, we consider the prior test's amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit, the period of time since a reporting unit's last quantitative test, the extent a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units, and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test. when performing a qualitative test, we assess numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values. examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price, our financial performance, market and competitive factors in our industry and other events specific to our reporting units. if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative impairment test. the quantitative impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, and recognizes an impairment loss for the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. we determine the fair value of a reporting unit using both a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach. determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions. our most recent annual impairment assessment of our reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2022 determined that our goodwill of $36.8 billion was not impaired as the estimated fair values of the respective reporting units exceeded the carrying values. however, for four of our reporting units, with aggregate goodwill of $10.9 billion, the excess of the respective reporting unit's fair value over carrying value ranged from 7 to 18 percent. if future operating performance is below our expectations or there are material changes to forecasted revenue growth rates or operating margins, risk-adjusted discount rates, foreign currency exchange rates, effective income tax rates, or some combination thereof, a decline in the fair value of the reporting units could result in, and we may be required to record, a goodwill impairment charge. additionally, a significant change in a merchant alliance business relationship or operating performance could result in a material goodwill impairment charge. it is also reasonably possible that future developments related to the interest rate environment, a shift in strategic initiatives, or significant changes in the composition of certain of our reporting units could have a future material impact on one or more of the estimates and assumptions used to evaluate goodwill impairment. we have no accumulated goodwill impairment through december 31, 2022. additional information regarding our goodwill is included in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. we review capitalized software development costs for impairment at each reporting date. recoverability of intangible assets is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to either the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or the net realizable value of the asset, depending on the type of asset. determining future cash flows and net realizable values involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions regarding future economic and market conditions. measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value. additional information regarding our intangible assets is included in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. revenue recognition revenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer, and excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties. as a practical expedient, we do not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component if, at contract inception, the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is expected to be one year or less. contracts with customers are evaluated on a contract-by-contract basis as contracts may include multiple types of goods and services as described below. processing and services processing and services revenue is generated from account- and transaction-based fees for data processing, merchant transaction processing and acquiring, electronic billing and payment services, electronic funds transfer and debit/credit processing services; consulting and professional services; and software maintenance for ongoing client support. we recognize processing and services revenue in the period in which the specific service is performed unless they are not deemed distinct from other goods or services, which revenue would then be recognized as control is transferred of the combined goods and services. our arrangements for processing and services typically consist of an obligation to provide specific services to our customers on a when- and if-needed basis (a stand-ready obligation) and revenue is recognized from the satisfaction of the performance obligations in the amount billable to the customer. these services are typically provided under a fixed or declining (tier-based) price per unit based on volume of service; however, pricing for services may also be based on minimum monthly usage fees. fees for our processing and services arrangements are typically billed and paid on a monthly basis. product product revenue is generated from print and card production sales, as well as software license and hardware (primarily pos devices) sales. for software license agreements that are distinct, we recognize software license revenue upon delivery, assuming a contract is deemed to exist. revenue for arrangements with customers that include significant customization, modification or production of software such that the software is not distinct is typically recognized over time based upon efforts expended, such as labor hours, to measure progress towards completion. for arrangements involving hosted licensed software for the customer, a software element is considered present to the extent the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and it is feasible for the customer to either operate the software on their own hardware or contract with another vendor to host the software. we sell or lease hardware (pos devices) and other peripherals as part of our contracts with customers. hardware typically consists of terminals or clover devices. we do not manufacture hardware, rather we purchase hardware from third-party vendors and hold such hardware in inventory until purchased by a customer. we account for the sale of hardware as a separate performance obligation and recognize the revenue at the standalone selling price when the customer obtains control of the hardware. significant judgments we use the following methods, inputs and assumptions in determining amounts of revenue to recognize. for multi-element arrangements, we account for individual goods or services as a separate performance obligation if they are distinct, if the good or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement, and if a customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. if these criteria are not met, the promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. determining whether goods or services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment. technology or service components from third parties are frequently embedded in or combined with our applications or service offerings. whether we recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer or the net amount retained involves judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances, including the level of contractual responsibilities and obligations for delivering solutions to end customers, to determine whether we obtain control of goods and services prior to their transfer to a customer. the transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring products or services to the customer. we include any fixed charges within our contracts as part of the total transaction price. to the extent that variable consideration is not constrained, we include an estimate of the variable amount, as appropriate, within the total transaction price and update our assumptions over the duration of the contract. we may constrain the estimated transaction price in the event of a high degree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount owed because of an extended length of time over which the fees may be adjusted. the transaction price (including any discounts or rebates) is allocated between distinct goods and services in a multi-element arrangement based on their relative standalone selling prices. for items that are not sold separately, we estimate the standalone selling prices using available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines. judgment may be required to determine standalone selling prices for each performance obligation and whether it depicts the amount we expect to receive in exchange for the related good or service. contract modifications occur when we and our customers agree to modify existing customer contracts to change the scope or price (or both) of the contract, or when a customer terminates some, or all, of the existing services provided by us. when a contract modification occurs, it requires us to exercise judgment to determine if the modification should be accounted for as (i) a separate contract, (ii) the termination of the original contract and creation of a new contract, or (iii) a cumulative catch up adjustment to the original contract. further, contract modifications require the identification and evaluation of the performance obligations of the modified contract, including the allocation of revenue to the remaining performance obligations and the period of recognition for each identified performance obligation. additional information regarding our revenue recognition policies is included in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. income taxes the determination of our provision for income taxes requires management's judgment in the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws, sometimes made more complex by our global footprint. judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. we establish a liability for known tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item. in establishing a liability for known tax exposures, assumptions are made in determining whether, and the extent to which, a tax position will be sustained. a tax benefit with respect to a tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority, based on its technical merits, considering the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date. the amount of tax benefit recognized reflects the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on settlement with the relevant taxing authority. as additional information becomes available, we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our liability for known tax exposures as appropriate. we maintain net operating loss carryforwards in various taxing jurisdictions, resulting in the establishment of deferred tax assets. we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when, based upon the weight of all available evidence, we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. in making this determination, we have considered the relative impact of all of the available positive and negative evidence regarding future sources of taxable income and available tax planning strategies. however, there could be a material impact to our effective income tax rate if there is a significant change in our judgment. to the extent our judgment changes, the valuation allowances are then adjusted, generally through the provision for income taxes, in the period in which the change in facts and circumstances occurs. additional information regarding our income taxes is included in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. results of operations components of revenue and expenses the following summary describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income. processing and services processing and services revenue, which represented 82% of our total revenue in 2022, is primarily generated from account- and transaction-based fees under multi-year contracts. processing and services revenue is most reflective of our business performance as a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. cost of processing and services consists of costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain software applications; client support; certain depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses. product product revenue, which represented 18% of our total revenue in 2022, is derived from print and card production sales, as well as software license and hardware (primarily pos devices) sales. cost of product consists of costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following: costs of materials and postage; software development; hardware costs (primarily pos devices); personnel; infrastructure costs; certain depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue. selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages, commissions and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; third-party commissions; advertising and promotional costs; certain depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses. financial results the following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from year to year. this information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

$1,511 million, or 9%, in 2022 compared to 2021. the revenue increase was driven by higher processing revenue and product sales across all of our business segments, partially offset by a 2% decrease due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. revenue in our acceptance segment increased $813 million, or 13%, in 2022 compared to 2021. the revenue increase was driven by higher global merchant acquiring payment and transaction volumes, an increase in the number of active merchants on our clover operating system and the expansion of our merchant relationships through value-added services. the revenue growth of our clover and carat operating systems were above pre-covid-19 pandemic levels and contributed 5% and 1%, respectively, to acceptance segment growth. the remaining revenue growth in our acceptance segment was attributable to higher merchant acquiring payment and transaction volumes across our other merchant acquiring platforms. revenue in our fintech segment increased $148 million, or 5%, in 2022 compared to 2021. the revenue increase was driven by both higher processing revenue and license and termination fee revenue across our fintech businesses, with each contributing approximately 2% to fintech revenue growth. revenue in our payments segment increased $429 million, or 7%, in 2022 compared to 2021. the revenue increase was driven by our debit processing business, which contributed 3% to payments segment revenue growth through new client wins on our network routing services; our output solutions business, which contributed 2%, primarily driven by new client growth; and our credit processing business, which contributed 1%, primarily driven by an increase in active accounts. revenue at corporate and other increased $121 million, or 14%, in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to increased postage revenue. total expenses total expenses in 2022 were relatively consistent compared to 2021. total expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased 700 basis points to 78.9% in 2022 compared to 2021. total expenses as a percentage of total revenue were favorably impacted in 2022 by a reduction of approximately 390 basis points in acquisition and integration related expense and approximately 90 basis points in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. total expenses as a percentage of total revenue for 2022 were also favorably impacted by operating leverage, along with a pre-tax gain on the sale of businesses and other assets of $54 million. cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased to 39.9% in 2022 compared to 45.7% in 2021. cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was favorably impacted in 2022 by approximately 330 basis points from a reduction in acquisition and integration related expenses, as well as strong operating leverage across our businesses, and partially offset by an increase in severance costs of approximately 50 basis points in 2022. cost of product as a percentage of product revenue decreased to 67.8% in 2022 compared to 70.0% in 2021. the cost of product as a percentage of product revenue improved in 2022 as a result of higher margin revenue growth. selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 34.2% in 2022 compared to 35.8% in 2021. the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2022 was primarily due to a reduction in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of approximately 100 basis points. the net gain on sale of businesses and other assets in 2022 included a $137 million pre-tax gain from the sale of certain merchant contracts in conjunction with the mutual termination of one of our merchant alliance joint ventures and a $44 million pre-tax gain from the sale of fiserv costa rica, s.a. and our sis operations. these gains were partially offset by a $127 million pre-tax loss from the sale of our korea operations. operating income and operating margin total operating income increased $1,452 million, or 63%, in 2022 compared to 2021. total operating margin increased 700 basis points to 21.1% in 2022 compared to 2021. total operating income and total operating margin benefited from revenue growth in 2022, along with a reduction in acquisition and integration related expenses. total operating income and total operating margin were also favorably impacted by a $54 million net pre-tax gain on the sale of businesses and other assets in 2022, partially offset by an increase in severance costs of approximately $130 million. operating income in our acceptance segment increased $325 million, or 16%, in 2022 compared to 2021. operating margin increased 100 basis points to 31.8% in 2022 compared to 2021. operating margin growth in 2022 was primarily due to operating leverage and the divestiture of a lower-margin business within the acceptance segment. operating income in our fintech segment increased $76 million, or 7%, in 2022 compared to 2021. operating margin increased 70 basis points to 36.5% in 2022 compared to 2021. fintech segment operating income and margin growth in 2022 was due to an increase in license and termination fee revenue. operating income in our payments segment increased $266 million, or 10%, in 2022 compared to 2021. operating margin increased 130 basis points to 45.1% in 2022 compared to 2021. payments segment operating income and margin growth in 2022 was primarily due to scalable revenue growth from our debit and credit processing businesses. the operating loss in corporate and other decreased $785 million in 2022 compared to 2021. corporate and other was favorably impacted by a reduction of approximately $850 million in acquisition and integration related costs and amortization of acquisition related intangible assets. the operating loss in 2022 also included a $54 million pre-tax gain on the sale of businesses and other assets and approximately $130 million of increased severance costs. interest expense, net interest expense, net increased $40 million, or 6%, in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher interest rates on outstanding borrowings. other (expense) income other expense increased $165 million in 2022 compared to 2021. other (expense) income includes net foreign currency transaction gains and losses, gains or losses from a change in fair value of investments in certain equity securities, and amounts related to debt guarantee arrangements of certain joint ventures. net foreign currency transaction (losses) gains were $(62) million and $12 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. other expense in 2022 also includes net pre-tax expense of $48 million associated with joint venture debt guarantees. other income in 2021 included $12 million related to a pre-tax gain on the remeasurement of a previously held investment in ondot to fair value upon acquiring the remaining ownership interest in the entity. income tax provision income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes and income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates was 18.9% and 21.8% in 2022 and 2021, respectively. the decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily the result of $134 million of income tax expense in 2021 attributed to the revaluation of certain net deferred tax liabilities, primarily related to intangible assets and investments in joint ventures recognized at fair value in connection with the acquisition of first data corporation, reflecting the effect of enacted corporate income tax rate changes in the united kingdom (tax rate increase from 19% to 25% starting in 2023) and argentina (tax rate increase from 25% to 35%). income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates our share of net income from affiliates accounted for using the equity method is reported as income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, and the related tax expense is reported within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income. income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, including acquired intangible asset amortization from valuations in purchase accounting, was $220 million and $100 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates in 2022 includes pre-tax gains totaling $209 million, primarily related to the acquisition-date fair value remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in finxact of $110 million, as well as $80 million resulting from the dilution of our ownership interest in conjunction with the sagent m&c, llc transaction with a third party. income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates in 2021 included a $33 million pre-tax gain resulting from the sale of our remaining ownership interest in investcloud holdings, llc (\"investcloud\"), as well as a $28 million pre-tax gain resulting from the dilution of our ownership interest in connection with the tegra118 merger with a third party. net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests relates to the minority partners' share of the net income in our consolidated subsidiaries. net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, including acquired intangible asset amortization from valuations in purchase accounting, was $52 million and $69 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. net income per share - diluted net income attributable to fiserv, inc. per share-diluted was $3.91 and $1.99 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. net income attributable to fiserv, inc. per share-diluted in 2021 included $134 million of certain discrete tax expenses discussed above, as well as higher acquisition and integration related expenses. liquidity and capital resources general our primary liquidity needs in the ordinary course of business are to: (i) fund normal operating expenses; (ii) meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness, including finance leases; and (iii) fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. we believe these needs will be satisfied in both the short and long term using cash flow generated by our operations, along with our cash and cash equivalents of $902 million, proceeds from the issuance of u.s. dollar and euro commercial paper, and available capacity under our revolving credit facility of $870 million (net of outstanding borrowings and $5.1 billion of capacity designated for outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs, senior notes due in 2023 and letters of credit) at december 31, 2022. the following table summarizes our net cash provided by operating activities, or operating cash flow and capital expenditure amounts for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively: year ended increase (decrease) december 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 $ % net income $2,582 $1,403 $1,179 depreciation and amortization 3,212 3,248 (36) share-based compensation 323 239 84 deferred income taxes (558) (262)

software and other intangibles $1,479 $1,160 $319 28 % our operating cash flow was $4.6 billion in 2022, an increase of 14% compared with $4.0 billion in 2021. this increase was primarily attributable to improved operating results, partially offset by higher working capital use compared to the prior year, including increased accounts receivable corresponding to revenue growth and slower customer payments, as well as an increase in future credit card receivables purchased under our clover capital program. we maintain investments in various affiliates that are accounted for as equity method investments. total distributions from unconsolidated affiliates, including those classified as cash flows from investing activities, were $211 million and $149 million during the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to fund capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions and to repay debt rather than to pay dividends. our capital expenditures were approximately 8% and 7% of our total revenue in 2022 and 2021, respectively. cash requirements the following table details our future cash requirements under certain contractual obligations at december 31, 2022: (in millions) total less than 1-3 years 3-5 years more than 1 year 5 years long-term debt including interest (1) (2) $26,206 $950 $5,155 $9,705

(2)the calculations assume that only mandatory debt repayments are made, no additional refinancing or lending occurs, except for our 0.375% euro-denominated senior notes due in july 2023, 3.800% senior notes due in october 2023, and u.s. dollar and euro commercial paper notes programs as we have the intent to refinance this debt on a long-term basis through the issuance of new commercial paper notes upon maturity, and we have the ability to do so under our revolving credit facility maturing in june 2027. the variable rate on the revolving credit facility and term loans are priced at the rate in effect at december 31, 2022. share repurchases we repurchased $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion (including the repurchase described below) of our common stock in 2022 and 2021, respectively. as of december 31, 2022, we had approximately 16.9 million shares remaining under our then existing repurchase authorization. on february 22, 2023, our board of directors approved a repurchase authorization for an additional 75.0 million shares. shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans. in 2021, new omaha holdings l.p. (\"new omaha\"), a shareholder of ours, completed an underwritten secondary public offering of 23.0 million shares of our common stock (the \"offering\"). we repurchased from the underwriters 5.0 million shares of our common stock that were subject to the offering. the share repurchase totaled $588 million and was funded with cash on hand. the repurchased shares were cancelled and no longer outstanding following the completion of the share repurchase. acquisitions and dispositions acquisitions we acquired yacaré and merchant one in december 2022, nextable in september 2022 and city pos in june 2022. additionally, we acquired a remaining ownership interest in finxact in april 2022, in which we previously held a noncontrolling interest. we acquired these businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $994 million, net of $28 million of acquired cash, and including earn-out provisions estimated at a fair value of $6 million. we funded these acquisitions in 2022 by utilizing a combination of available cash and proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. we acquired bentobox in november 2021, aip in october 2021, spendlabs in june 2021, pineapple payments in may 2021, and radius8 in march 2021. additionally, we acquired a remaining ownership interest in netpay in november 2021 and a remaining ownership interest in ondot in january 2021, in which we previously held noncontrolling equity interests. we acquired these businesses for an aggregate purchase price of $882 million, net of $43 million of acquired cash, and including earn-out provisions at an aggregate fair value of $34 million. we funded these acquisitions in 2021 by utilizing a combination of available cash, proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and existing availability under our revolving credit facility. the results of operations for these acquired businesses are included in our consolidated results from the respective dates of acquisition. dispositions we sold fiserv costa rica, s.a. and our sis operations in october 2022 and our korea operations in september 2022 for aggregate net cash proceeds of $77 million, along with a minority noncontrolling equity interest in the buyer of the korea operations. effective march 2022, we mutually agreed to terminate a merchant alliance joint venture with a minority partner. in conjunction with such termination, the joint venture minority partner elected to exercise its option to purchase certain additional merchant contracts of the joint venture for cash proceeds of $175 million. the net proceeds from these dispositions were primarily used to pay down indebtedness and repurchase shares of our common stock. we previously maintained a noncontrolling interest in tegra118, llc (\"tegra118\") which was accounted for under the equity method. in february 2021, tegra118 completed a merger with a third party, resulting in a dilution of our ownership interest in the combined new entity, wealthtech holdings, llc, which was subsequently renamed as investcloud. in connection with the transaction, we made an additional capital contribution, funded under our revolving credit facility, of $200 million into the combined entity and, in june 2021, we sold our entire ownership interest in investcloud for $466 million. the net proceeds from the sale were primarily used to pay down outstanding borrowings on our term loan facility. indebtedness our debt consisted of the following at december 31: (in millions) 2022 2021 short-term and current maturities of long-term debt: foreign lines of

lease and other financing obligations 539 528 total long-term debt $20,950 $20,729 at december 31, 2022, our debt consisted primarily of $16.8 billion of fixed-rate senior notes and $3.5 billion of outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs. interest on our u.s. dollar-denominated senior notes is paid semi-annually, while interest on our euro and british pound-denominated senior notes is paid annually. interest on our revolving credit facility and commercial paper notes is generally paid weekly, or more frequently on occasion, and interest on our term loan is paid monthly. outstanding borrowings under our 0.375% euro-denominated senior notes due in july 2023, 3.800% senior notes due in october 2023, and u.s dollar and euro commercial paper programs are classified in the consolidated balance sheet as long-term, as we have the intent to refinance these borrowings on a long-term basis through the continued issuance of new commercial paper notes upon maturity, and we also have the ability to refinance such borrowings under our revolving credit facility, as further discussed below. in july 2022, we redeemed $700 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 3.500% senior notes due in october 2022 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. we financed the redemption of these notes using proceeds from the issuance of u.s. dollar commercial paper. we also repaid $485 million, representing all amounts outstanding on our receivable securitized loan, in july 2022, using proceeds from the issuance of u.s. dollar commercial paper and terminated the underlying receivables financing agreement. in june 2022, we entered into a new senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility with substantially the same syndicate of banks that were lenders under our prior amended and restated revolving credit facility, which we voluntarily terminated and replaced. the new credit agreement matures in june 2027 and provides for a maximum aggregate principal amount of availability of $6.0 billion. variable rate debt our variable rate debt consisted of the following at december 31, 2022: (in millions) maturity weighted-average interest rate outstanding borrowings foreign lines of credit n/a 30.58% $198 u.s. dollar commercial paper notes various 4.82% 2,329 euro commercial paper notes various 1.92% 1,210 revolving credit facility june 2027 5.44% 35 term loan facility july 2024 5.64% 200 total variable rate debt 5.27% $3,972 we maintain certain short-term lines of credit with foreign banks and alliance partners primarily to fund settlement activity associated with international operations in latin america. we maintain u.s. dollar and euro unsecured commercial paper programs with various maturities generally ranging from one day to four months. outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs bear interest based on the prevailing rates at the time of issuance. in august 2022, we increased our u.s. commercial paper program borrowing capacity to $6.0 billion to align with the maximum amount of availability under our revolving credit facility. as discussed above, we maintain a revolving credit facility with aggregate commitments available for $6.0 billion of total capacity. borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on a secured overnight financing rate (\"sofr\") or a base rate in the case of u.s. dollar borrowings, in each case plus a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. we are required to pay a facility fee based on the aggregate commitments in effect under the credit agreement from time to time. we maintain a term loan credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions. outstanding borrowings under the term loan bear interest at a variable rate based on one-month libor or a base rate, in each case plus a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. debt covenants and compliance the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that, among other matters, limit (i) our ability to consolidate or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person, (ii) our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to create or assume liens, and (iii) our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. we may, at our option, redeem the senior notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to the applicable maturity date. the new revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us to, among other things, limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than 3.75 times our consolidated net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash charges and expenses and certain other adjustments (\"ebitda\") during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, subject to certain exceptions. the term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us to, among other things, (i) limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than 3.5 times our ebitda during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, subject to certain exceptions, and (ii) maintain ebitda of at least 3.0 times our consolidated interest expense as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all financial debt covenants. our ability to meet future debt covenant requirements will depend on our continued ability to generate earnings and cash flows. we expect to remain in compliance with all terms and conditions associated with our outstanding debt, including financial debt covenants. debt guarantees we maintain noncontrolling ownership interests in sagent m&c, llc and defi solutions group, llc (collectively, the \"lending joint ventures\"). the lending joint ventures maintain, as amended in april 2022, variable-rate term loan facilities with aggregate outstanding borrowings of $437 million in senior unsecured debt at december 31, 2022 and variable-rate revolving credit facilities with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $83 million with a syndicate of banks, which mature in april 2027. there were no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facilities at december 31, 2022. we have guaranteed the debt of the lending joint ventures and do not anticipate that the lending joint ventures will fail to fulfill their debt obligations. we maintained a liability of $40 million at december 31, 2022 for the estimated fair value of our non-contingent obligations to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee arrangements. such guarantees will be amortized in future periods over the contractual term of the debt. in addition, we maintained a contingent liability of $21 million at december 31, 2022, representing the current expected credit losses to which we are exposed. this contingent liability is estimated based on certain financial metrics of the lending joint ventures and historical industry data, which is used to develop assumptions of the likelihood the guaranteed parties will default and the level of credit losses in the event a default occurs. we have not made any payments under the guarantees, nor have we been called upon to do so. other access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and our ability to refinance maturing debt and fund future acquisitions. our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock. as of december 31, 2022, we had a corporate credit rating of baa2 with a stable outlook from moody's investors service, inc. (\"moody's\") and bbb with a stable outlook from standard & poor's ratings services (\"s&p\") on our senior unsecured debt securities. as of december 31, 2022, we had a commercial paper credit rating of p-2 from moody's and a-2 from s&p. the interest rates payable on certain of our senior notes, term loan and commercial paper notes programs are subject to adjustment from time to time if moody's or s&p changes the debt rating applicable to the notes. if the ratings from moody's or s&p decrease below investment grade, the per annum interest rates on certain senior notes are subject to increase by up to two percent. in no event will the total increase in the per annum interest rates exceed two percent above the original interest rates, nor will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes. cash and cash equivalents investments, exclusive of settlement assets, with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to cash are considered to be cash equivalents as reflected within our consolidated balance sheets. at december 31, 2022 and 2021, we held $902 million and $835 million in cash and cash equivalents, respectively. the table below details the cash and cash equivalents at december 31: 2022 2021 (in millions) domestic international total domestic international total available $135 $153 $288 $180 $221 $401 unavailable (1) 178 436 614 138 296 434 total $313 $589 $902 $318 $517 $835 (1)represents cash held by our joint ventures that is not available to fund operations outside of those entities unless the board of directors of the relevant entity declares a dividend, as well as cash held by other entities that are subject to foreign exchange controls in certain countries or regulatory capital requirements. employee termination costs we recorded $187 million and $95 million of employee termination costs related to cash severance and other separation costs for terminated employees during the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. employee termination costs include those charges incurred in connection with the acquisition of first data corporation during the year ended december 31, 2021. the employee severance and other separation costs accrued balance of $23 million at december 31, 2022 is expected to be paid within the next twelve months.\"\"\"\n\n    Instruction:\n    Identify and summarize all sentences or phrases that are directly or indirectly related to \"organizational resilience\", including but not limited to: scholars have defined organizational resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” (vogus & sutcliffe, 2007: 3418).

not meaningful product gross margin product gross margin increased to 79.0% in 2022 as compared to 75.6% in 2021, primarily driven by a $1.25 billion charge for a settlement related to bictegravir litigation in the fourth quarter of 2021 that did not repeat in 2022. the increase was partially offset by higher royalty expenses driven by biktarvy royalties, the reversal of a $175 million litigation reserve in the third quarter of 2021 that did not repeat in 2022, and changes in product mix. research and development expenses research and development expenses increased by $376 million in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher clinical development spend related mostly to trodelvy and the arcus biosciences, inc. (\"arcus\") collaboration, as well as inflationary increases. acquired in-process research and development expenses acquired in-process research and development expenses of $944 million in 2022 were primarily related to a $389 million charge associated with our acquisition of mirobio, a $315 million charge associated with the dragonfly collaboration, an $82 million charge associated with the jounce collaboration and acquisition of gs-1811, and a $60 million charge associated with the macrogenics collaboration. acquired in-process research and development expenses of $939 million in 2021 were primarily related to a $625 million charge associated with an option exercised under the arcus collaboration. see note 6. acquisitions and note 10. collaborations and other arrangements of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information. in-process research and development impairment in connection with our acquisition of immunomedics in 2020, we allocated a portion of the purchase price to acquired ipr&d intangible assets. approximately $8.8 billion was assigned to ipr&d intangible assets related to trodelvy for treatment of patients with hr+/her2- breast cancer. in march 2022, we received data from the phase 3 tropics-02 study evaluating trodelvy in patients with hr+/her2- mbc who have received prior endocrine therapy, cdk4/6 inhibitors and two to four lines of chemotherapy (\"third-line plus patients\"). based on our evaluation of the study results, and in connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the first quarter, we updated our estimate of the fair value of our hr+/her2- ipr&d intangible asset to $6.1 billion as of march 31, 2022. our estimate of fair value used a probability weighted income approach that discounts expected future cash flows to the present value. the expected cash flows included cash flows from hr+/her2- mbc for third-line plus patients and patients in earlier lines of therapy which are the subject of separate clinical studies. our revised discounted cash flows were lower primarily due to a delay in launch timing for third-line plus patients which caused a decrease in our market share assumptions based on the expected competitive environment. there were no changes in our plans or assumptions related to our estimated cash flows for patients in the earlier lines of therapy. we determined the revised estimated fair value was below the carrying value of the asset and, as a result, we recognized a partial impairment charge of $2.7 billion in in-process research and development impairment on our consolidated statements of income during the three months ended march 31, 2022. the remaining balance of the hr+/her2- ipr&d intangible asset at the time of the assessment related to cash flows from earlier lines of therapy, where we have phase 3 pivotal studies in development, in addition to the revised cash flows related to the third-line plus patient setting. if future events result in adverse changes in the key assumptions used in determining fair value, including the timing of product launches, information on the competitive landscape of treatments in this indication, changes to the probability of technical or regulatory success, failure to obtain anticipated regulatory approval or discount rate, among others, additional impairments may be recorded and could be material to our financial statements. no other ipr&d impairment charges were recorded in 2022 or 2021. selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $427 million in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to a $406 million charge associated with the termination of the trodelvy license collaboration agreement with everest, which had provided everest with broad commercialization and development rights to trodelvy in certain asia territories. we terminated the existing agreement and reacquired the trodelvy rights in these territories. other spending increases in 2022 included increased promotional and marketing investing, mostly in trodelvy and cell therapy, as well as higher corporate activities and inflationary increases, slightly offset by a decrease in donations to the gilead foundation in 2022 as compared to 2021. interest expense and other income (expense), net the following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our interest expense and other income (expense), net: (in millions, except percentages) 2022 2021 change interest expense $(935) $(1,001) (7) % other income (expense), net $(581) $(639) (9) % interest expense decreased by $66 million in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to lower outstanding debt balances. the changes in other income (expense), net for 2022, compared to 2021, primarily reflects higher interest income due to rising interest rates, partially offset by higher net unrealized losses from equity securities. income taxes the following table summarizes the period-over-period changes in our income tax expense: (in millions, except percentages) 2022 2021 change income before income taxes $5,814 $8,278 $(2,464) income tax expense $(1,248) $(2,077) $829 effective tax rate 21.5 % 25.1 % (3.6) % our effective tax rate decreased in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to a beneficial change in jurisdictional mix of income and lower state taxes. liquidity and capital resources we continually evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure that we can adequately and efficiently finance our operations. liquidity cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities were $7.6 billion and $7.8 billion as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. cash and cash equivalents increased by $74 million from december 31, 2021 to december 31, 2022. the following table summarizes our cash flow activities: (in millions) 2022 2021 net cash provided by (used in): operating activities $9,072 $11,384 investing activities $(2,466) $(3,131) financing activities $(6,469) $(8,877) effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents $(63) $(35) operating activities net cash provided by operating activities is derived by adjusting our net income for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. net cash provided by operating activities was $9.1 billion in 2022, compared to $11.4 billion in 2021. the decrease was primarily due to the $1.25 billion payment made in the first quarter of 2022 in connection with the legal settlement related to bictegravir litigation as well as higher income tax payments made and higher operating expenses in 2022. investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $2.5 billion in 2022, compared to $3.1 billion in 2021. the decrease was primarily due to lower net purchases of marketable debt and equity securities, partially offset by higher capital expenditures and other acquisitions. financing activities net cash used in financing activities was $6.5 billion in 2022, compared to $8.9 billion in 2021. in 2022, we utilized cash for $1.5 billion of debt repayments, $3.7 billion of dividend payments and $1.4 billion of common stock repurchases. in 2021, we utilized cash for $4.75 billion of debt repayments, $3.6 billion of dividend payments, and $546 million of common stock repurchases. capital resources we believe our existing capital resources, including cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and our revolving credit facility, supplemented by cash flows generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. as of december 31, 2022, our material cash requirements consisted primarily of the repayment of outstanding borrowings, income tax payments, including the remaining obligations for the one-time repatriation transition tax from the tax cuts and jobs act, purchases of inventory, operating lease obligations, capital expenditures and milestone and other payments related to our collaborative agreements. see notes 6. acquisitions, 10. collaborations and other arrangements, 11. debt and credit facilities, 12. leases, 13. commitments and contingencies and 17. income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information. we enter into certain unconditional purchase obligations, capital expenditure projects and other commitments in the normal course of business. there have been no changes to these commitments during the year that would have a material impact on the company's ability to meet either short-term or long-term cash requirements. our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following: •the commercial performance of our current and future products; •the progress and scope of our r&d efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials; •the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews; •the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities; •the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities; •the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products; •debt service requirements; •future dividends subject to declaration by our board of directors; •the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and •costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of government investigations and litigation. we may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. if such funding is required, we cannot guarantee that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. we may choose to repay certain of our long-term debt obligations prior to maturity dates based on our assessment of current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements critical accounting estimates see note 1. organization and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for information about our significant accounting policies and how estimates are involved in the preparation of our financial statements. we believe the following reflect the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. rebates and chargebacks rebates and chargebacks are determined using a complex estimation process and are subject to uncertainty in part due to the lag between the date of the product sales and the date the related rebates or chargeback claims are settled. in developing our estimates of rebates and chargebacks, we consider the following: •product sales, including product mix and pricing; •historical and estimated payer mix; •statutory discount requirements and contractual terms; •historical claims experience and processing time lags; •estimated patient population; •known market events or trends; •market research; •channel inventory data obtained from our major u.s. wholesalers; and •other pertinent internal or external information. the following table summarizes the consolidated activities and ending balances in our rebates and chargebacks accounts, including adjustments made relating to previous years' sales as a result of changes in estimates: (in millions) balance at beginning of year decrease/(increase) to product sales payments balance at end of year year ended december 31, 2022: activity related to 2022 sales $- $13,040 $(9,442) $3,598 activity related to sales prior to 2022 3,915 (418) (3,067) 430 total $3,915 $12,622 $(12,509) $4,028 year ended december 31, 2021: activity related to 2021 sales $- $13,211 $(9,714) $3,497 activity related to sales prior to 2021 4,012 (617) (2,977) 418 total $4,012 $12,594 $(12,691) $3,915 our net product sales in 2022 include the impact of $418 million for changes in rebate and chargeback estimates related to sales prior to 2022. historically, our actual rebates and chargebacks claimed for prior periods have varied by less than 5% from our estimates. valuation of intangible assets determining the fair values of intangible assets, whether as part of a business combination or impairment assessment, involves the use of a probability-weighted income approach that discounts expected future cash flows to present value and requires the use of critical estimated inputs, including: •identification of product candidates with sufficient substance requiring separate recognition; •estimates of projected future cash flows, including revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates, which, for example, include significant inputs such as addressable patient population, treatment duration and projected market share; •the probability of technical and regulatory success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development; •the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates; •an appropriate discount rate based on the estimated weighted-average cost of capital for companies with profiles similar to our profile, representing the rate that market participants would use to value the intangible assets; •the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals; and •risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. these estimates are subject to uncertainty due to the high rate of failure inherent in the discovery and development of new products; delays that can occur in development, approval and product launch processes; unanticipated decisions made by regulatory agencies; advent of competing products; unexpected changes in u.s. and global financial markets and other unanticipated events and circumstances. if future events result in adverse changes in the critical assumptions used in determining fair value, impairment charges on our intangible assets may be recorded and could be material to our financial statements. for example, in 2022, we recognized a $2.7 billion impairment charge related to our hr+/her2- ipr&d intangible asset related to an expected delay in launch timing which caused a decrease in our market share assumptions based on the expected competitive environment. legal contingencies we are a party to various legal actions. certain significant matters are described in note 13. commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. critical inputs to the accruals recorded and disclosures provided in relation to these matters include the probability of a certain outcome of the case, the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable and the amount of potential exposure. these inputs are subject to uncertainty due to changes in the legal facts and circumstances of the case, status of the proceedings, applicable law, the views of legal counsel and the views of any judges or jury involved in the case. upon the final resolution of such matters, it is possible that there may be a loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. we periodically reassess these matters when additional information becomes available and adjust our estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances indicate the need for any changes. for example, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded an accrual of $1.25 billion in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets for the settlement related to bictegravir litigation. income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and various foreign jurisdictions, including ireland. critical inputs in determining our provision for income taxes and related tax balances include forecasts of our future income and expenses, potential tax planning strategies and determination of the probability of certain tax positions being sustained upon examination by tax authorities. these inputs are subject to uncertainty due to potential changes in facts and circumstances, economic and political conditions, changes to existing tax laws and new regulations or interpretations by tax authorities. changes in these conditions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.\"\"\"\n\n    Instruction:\n    Identify and

organizational resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” (vogus & sutcliffe, 2007: 3418). organizational resilience is defined as the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity. resilience can be defined as the system’s ability to maintain its integrity and its performance, at least partially, while under internal or external variations and disturbances (i.e. pressures, constraints, failures, errors, violations, hazards), whether nominal, extreme, or exceptional. defined as a company’s ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from a challenging situation. we develop a trajectory model of organizational resilience that focuses on how actors project temporal trajectories of responses toward disruptive events, reconstitute the trajectories in immediate response to the event, and reconfigure the trajectories toward the ensuing future. the concept of resilience draws attention to systems as well as individuals, to partial maintenance of integrity and performance, to the opposite of brittleness, and to disturbances that vary both in scale and source. resilience is a multifaceted concept that reflects businesses’ ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change to survive, grow, and flourish.\"\"\"\n\n    Text:\n    \"\"\"item 7.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with \"note about forward-looking statements,\" part i, item 1 \"business,\" part i, item 1a \"risk factors,\" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. we have omitted discussion of 2020 results where it would be redundant to the discussion previously included in item 7 of our 2021 annual report on form 10-k. understanding alphabet's financial results alphabet is a collection of businesses - the largest of which is google. we report google in two segments, google services and google cloud; we also report all non-google businesses collectively as other bets. for further details on our segments, see part i, item 1 \"business\" and note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. trends in our business and financial effect the following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that they will continue to affect our future results: •users' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves. the continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues since inception. we expect that this shift to an online world will continue to benefit our business and our revenues, although at a slower pace than we have experienced historically, in particular after the outsized growth in our advertising revenues during the covid-19 pandemic. in addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and advertisers, which may affect our revenues. •users continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which allows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins. our users are accessing the internet via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, wearables, and smart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. we are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business. we benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising formats. the margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search. additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues may be affected. for example, growth in the global smartphone market has slowed due to various factors, including increased market saturation in developed countries, which can affect our mobile advertising revenues. we expect tac paid to our distribution partners and google network partners to increase as our revenues grow and tac as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\"tac rate\") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic mix; partner mix; partner agreement terms; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product mix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms. we expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins. •as online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our monetization. as interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect our monetization. for example, revenues from ads on youtube and google play monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads. we also may develop new products incorporating ai innovations that could affect our monetization trends. additionally, when developing new products and services we generally focus first on user experience before prioritizing monetization. •as users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets continue to increase, and may require continued investments. in addition, movements in foreign exchange rates affect such revenues. the shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the u.s., including in emerging markets, such as india. we continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our products and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. this has led to a trend of increased alphabet inc. revenues from emerging markets. we expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these markets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. this trend could affect our revenues as developing markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets. international revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar. while we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings. •the revenues that we derive from non-advertising products and services are increasing and may adversely affect our margins. non-advertising revenues have grown over time, and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our products and services. the margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins on our advertising revenues. in particular margins on our hardware products adversely affect our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales. •as we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures. we continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to develop new, innovative offerings and improve our existing offerings across our businesses. we also expect to continue to invest in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of ai. in addition acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, and build strong partnerships around strategic initiatives. for example, in september 2022 we closed the acquisition of mandiant to help expand our offerings in dynamic cyber defense and response. •we face continuing changes in regulatory conditions, laws, and public policies, which could affect our business practices and financial results. changes in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics and related legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. as these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited, and we may need to change our business practices. examples include the antitrust complaints filed by the u.s. department of justice and a number of state attorneys general; pending litigation in the u.s., eu, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for websites and online platforms; and the digital markets act and digital services act in europe and various legislative proposals in the u.s. focused on large technology platforms. for additional information see item 1a risk factors and legal matters in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8. •our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them. our employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. we expect to continue hiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. for additional information see culture and workforce in part i, item 1 \"business.\" revenues and monetization metrics we generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products. for details on how we recognize revenue, see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. in addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business noted above, fluctuations in our revenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including: •changes in foreign currency exchange rates; •changes in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives; •general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and other measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending; •new product and service launches; and alphabet inc. •seasonality. additionally, fluctuations in our revenues generated from advertising (\"google advertising\"), revenues from other sources (\"google other revenues\"), google cloud, and other bets revenues have been and may continue to be affected by other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below. google services google services revenues consist of google advertising as well as google other revenues. google advertising google advertising revenues are comprised of the following: •google search & other, which includes revenues generated on google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other google owned and operated properties like gmail, google maps, and google play; •youtube ads, which includes revenues generated on youtube properties; and •google network, which includes revenues generated on google network properties participating in admob, adsense, and google ad manager. we use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our advertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on google search & other properties, while impressions and cost-per-impression pertain to traffic on our google network properties. paid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on google search properties and other google owned and operated properties including gmail, google maps, and google play. cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users. impressions include impressions displayed to users on google network properties participating primarily in admob, adsense, and google ad manager. cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users. as our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by the corresponding click and impression activity. fluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on google search & other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on google network properties and the correlation between these items have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as: •advertiser competition for keywords; •changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy; •changes in device mix; •seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality; and •traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and channels. google other google other revenues are comprised of the following: •google play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases; •hardware, which includes sales of fitbit wearable devices, google nest home products, and pixel devices; •youtube non-advertising, which includes subscription revenues from services such as youtube premium and youtube tv; and •other products and services. alphabet inc. fluctuations in our google other revenues have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as changes in customer usage and demand, number of subscribers, and fluctuations in the timing of product launches. google cloud google cloud revenues are comprised of the following: •google cloud platform, which includes fees for infrastructure, platform, and other services; •google workspace, which includes fees for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises, such as gmail, docs, drive, calendar and meet; and •other enterprise services. fluctuations in our google cloud revenues have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as customer usage. other bets revenues from other bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services. costs and expenses our cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. our operating expenses include costs related to r&d, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. certain of our costs and expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. cost of revenues cost of revenues is comprised of tac and other costs of revenues. •tac includes: ◦amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers. ◦amounts paid to google network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties. •other cost of revenues includes: ◦content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on youtube and google play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee). ◦expenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses, depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content review as well as customer and product support costs). ◦inventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell. tac as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on google network properties are significantly higher than tac as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on google search & other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on google network properties are paid as tac to our google network partners. operating expenses operating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either r&d, sales and marketing, or general and administrative. the main components of our r&d expenses are: •compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for r&d related to our existing and new products and services; •depreciation; and •third-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our engineering and product development efforts. alphabet inc. the main components of our sales and marketing expenses are: •compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service functions; and •spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services. the main components of our general and administrative expenses are: •compensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and other administrative support functions; •expenses relating to legal matters, including fines and settlements; and •third-party services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and other outsourced administrative services. other income (expense), net other income (expense), net primarily consists of interest income (expense), the effect of foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net gains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and non-marketable securities, performance fees, and income (loss) and impairment from our equity method investments. for additional details, including how we account for our investments and factors that can drive fluctuations in the value of our investments, see note 1 and note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k as well as item 7a, \"quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk\". provision for income taxes provision for income taxes represents the estimated amount of federal, state, and foreign income taxes incurred in the u.s. and the many jurisdictions in which we operate. the provision includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties. for additional details, including a reconciliation of the u.s. federal statutory rate to our effective tax rate, see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in

expect to incur employee severance and related charges of $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion, the majority of which will be recognized in the first quarter of 2023. in addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space. as a result we expect to incur exit costs relating to office space reductions of approximately $0.5 billion in the first quarter of 2023. we may incur additional charges in the future as we further evaluate our real estate needs. •in january 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment, resulting in a change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment to six years, which we expect to result in a reduction of depreciation of approximately $3.4 billion for the full fiscal year 2023 for assets in service as of december 31, 2022, recorded primarily in cost of revenues and r&d expenses. •as ai is critical to delivering our mission of bringing our breakthrough innovations into the

revenues. the growth in youtube non-advertising was largely due to an increase in paid subscribers. the growth in hardware was primarily driven by increased sales of pixel devices. the decrease in google play revenues was primarily driven by the fee structure changes we announced in 2021 as well as a decrease in buyer spending. additionally, the overall increase in google other revenues was adversely affected by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates. google cloud google cloud revenues increased $7.1 billion from 2021 to 2022. the growth was primarily driven by google cloud platform followed by google workspace offerings. google cloud's infrastructure and platform services were the largest drivers of growth in google cloud platform. revenues by geography the following table presents revenues by geography as a percentage of revenues, determined based on the addresses of our customers: year ended december 31, 2021 2022 united states 46 % 48 % emea 31 % 29 %

this annual report on form 10-k. use of non-gaap constant currency information international revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in multiple currencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. the effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons. we use non-gaap constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-gaap percentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results. constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. we define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements (\"fx effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. we use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period. alphabet inc. constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods. these results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with gaap. results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with gaap. the following table

increased $36.7 billion compared to $257.5 billion in revenues, excluding hedging effect for 2021. emea revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the u.s. dollar strengthening relative to the euro and the british pound. apac revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the u.s. dollar strengthening relative to the japanese yen and the australian dollar. other americas growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the u.s. dollar strengthening relative to the argentine peso. costs and expenses cost of revenues the following table presents cost of revenues, including tac (in millions, except percentages): year ended december 31, 2021 2022 tac $45,566 $48,955 other cost of revenues 65,373 77,248 total cost of revenues $110,939 $126,203 total cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues 43 % 45 % cost of revenues increased $15.3 billion from 2021 to 2022. the increase was due to an increase in other cost of revenues and tac of $11.9 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. the increase in tac from 2021 to 2022 was due to an increase in tac paid to distribution partners and to google network partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to tac. the tac rate was 22% in both 2021 and 2022. the tac rate on google search & other revenues and the tac rate on google network revenues were both substantially consistent from 2021 to 2022. the increase in other cost of revenues from 2021 to 2022 was primarily due to increases in data center costs and other operations costs as well as hardware costs. alphabet inc. research and development the following table presents r&d expenses (in millions, except percentages): year ended december 31, 2021 2022 research and development expenses $31,562 $39,500 research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues 12 % 14 % r&d expenses increased $7.9 billion from 2021 to 2022 primarily driven by an increase in compensation expenses of $5.4 billion, largely resulting from a 21% increase in average headcount, and an increase in third-party service fees of $704 million. sales and marketing the following table presents sales and marketing expenses (in millions, except percentages): year ended december 31, 2021 2022 sales and marketing expenses $22,912 $26,567 sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues 9 % 9 % sales and marketing expenses increased $3.7 billion from 2021 to 2022, primarily driven by an increase in

administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues 5 % 6 % general and administrative expenses increased $2.2 billion from 2021 to 2022. the increase was primarily driven by an increase in compensation expenses of $1.1 billion, largely resulting from a 21% increase in average headcount, and an increase in third-party services fees of $815 million. in addition, there was a $551 million increase to the allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, as the prior year comparable period reflected a decline in the allowance. segment profitability the following table presents segment operating income (loss) (in millions). year ended december 31, 2021 2022 operating income (loss): google services $91,855 $86,572 google cloud (3,099) (2,968) other bets (5,281) (6,083)

billion from 2021 to 2022 primarily due to changes in gains and losses on equity securities and performance fees. in 2022, $3.2 billion of net unrealized losses were recognized on marketable equity securities and $1.5 billion of net realized losses were recognized on debt securities. these losses were partially offset by interest income of $2.2 billion and reversals of previously accrued performance fees related to certain investments of $798 million. in 2021, $9.8 billion of net unrealized gains were recognized on non-marketable equity securities and $1.5 billion of interest income was recognized, partially offset by $1.9 billion of accrued performance fees related to certain investments. see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information. provision for income taxes the following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except for effective tax rate): year ended december

primarily driven by the effects of capitalization and amortization of r&d expenses in 2022 as required by the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act generating an increase in the u.s. federal foreign derived intangible income tax deduction. the decrease was partially offset by a decrease in pre-tax earnings, including in countries that have lower statutory rates and a decrease in the stock-based compensation related tax benefit. see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information. financial condition cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of december 31, 2022, we had $113.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities. cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and marketable equity securities. sources, uses of cash, and related trends our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from operations. the primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth of the business. we regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital return to stockholders. alphabet inc. the following table presents our cash flows (in millions): year ended december 31, 2021 2022 net cash provided by operating activities $91,652 $91,495 net cash used in investing activities $(35,523) $(20,298) net cash used in financing activities $(61,362) $(69,757) cash provided by operating activities our largest source of cash provided by operations are advertising revenues generated by google search & other properties, google network properties, and youtube properties. additionally, we generate cash through sales of apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for google cloud offerings and subscription-based products. our primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to distribution and google network partners, to employees for compensation, and to content providers. other uses of cash from operating activities include payments to suppliers for hardware, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures. net cash provided by operating activities decreased from 2021 to 2022 primarily due to the net effect of an increase in cash received from revenues, offset by increases in cash paid for cost of revenues and operating expenses and an increase in tax payments driven by the effects of capitalization and amortization of r&d expenses beginning in 2022 as required by the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act. cash used in investing activities cash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable and non-marketable securities. cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and non-marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions. net cash used in investing activities decreased from 2021 to 2022 as a result of a decrease in net purchases of and maturities and sales of marketable securities, partially offset by an increase in purchases of property and equipment. cash used in financing activities cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from the sale of interest in consolidated entities. cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of stock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, and repayments of debt. net cash used in financing activities increased from 2021 to 2022 primarily due to an increase in repurchases of stock. liquidity and material cash requirements we expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, cash flows from operations and financing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. capital expenditures and leases we make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets through purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our services and products. capital expenditures our capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories: •technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing, storage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including ai, (collectively referred to as our information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and •office facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as \"fit-outs\"). construction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet been placed in service. the time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend from months to years. for example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with multiple alphabet inc. phases, where we acquire qualified land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install information technology assets. during the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2022, we spent $24.6 billion and $31.5 billion on capital expenditures, respectively. depreciation of our property and equipment commences when the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use. land is not depreciated. for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2022, our depreciation and impairment expenses on property and equipment were $11.6 billion and $15.3 billion, respectively. leases for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2022, we recognized total operating lease assets of $3.0 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively. as of december 31, 2022, the amount of total future lease payments under operating leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 8 years, was $17.4 billion, of which $3.0 billion is short-term. as of december 31, 2022, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future short-term and long-term lease payments of $630 million and $3.1 billion that are not yet recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. these leases will commence between 2023 and 2026 with non-cancelable lease terms of 1 to 25 years. for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2022, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease costs) were $3.4 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. finance lease costs were not material for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2022. see note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on leases. financing we have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. as of december 31, 2022, we had no commercial paper outstanding. as of december 31, 2022, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in april 2023 and $6.0 billion expiring in april 2026. the interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. no amounts have been borrowed under the credit facilities. as of december 31, 2022, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $12.9 billion with short-term and long-term future interest payments of $231 million and $3.8 billion, respectively. see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our debt. we primarily utilize contract manufacturers for the assembly of our servers used in our technical infrastructure and hardware products we sell. we have agreements where we may purchase components directly from suppliers and then supply these components to contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of the servers and hardware products. certain of these arrangements result in a portion of the cash received from and paid to the contract manufacturers to be presented as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows included in item 8 of this annual report on from 10-k. share repurchase program in april 2022, the board of directors of alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its class a and class c shares. as of december 31, 2022, $28.1 billion remains available for class a and class c share repurchases. in accordance with the authorization of the board of directors of alphabet, during 2022 we repurchased and subsequently retired 530 million shares for $59.3 billion. of the aggregate amount repurchased and subsequently retired, 61 million shares were class a stock for $6.7 billion and 469 million shares were class c stock for $52.6 billion. see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. european commission fines in 2017, 2018 and 2019, the ec announced decisions that certain actions taken by google infringed european competition law and imposed fines of €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of june 27, 2017), €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of june 30, 2018), and €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of march 20, 2019), respectively. on september 14, 2022, the general court reduced the 2018 fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. we subsequently filed an appeal to the european court of justice. in 2018 we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022. while each ec decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. for alphabet inc. further details, see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. taxes as of december 31, 2022, we had short-term and long-term income taxes payable of $1.6 billion and $4.2 billion related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act (\"tax act\"). as permitted by the tax act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. we also have taxes payable of $5.1 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of december 31, 2022. purchase commitments as of december 31, 2022, we had material non-cancelable contractual obligations of $32.0 billion, of which $17.3 billion was short-term. these amounts represent the non-cancelable portion of agreements or the minimum cancellation fee and are primarily related to commitments to purchase licenses, technical infrastructure, inventory, and network capacity. for those agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of december 31, 2022. in addition we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and energy attributes, such as renewable energy certificates. these agreements do not include a minimum dollar commitment. the amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and are not readily determinable. critical accounting estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap. in doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions. our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of uncertainty at the time the estimate was made, and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. we base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. we have reviewed our critical accounting estimates with the audit and compliance committee of our board of directors. see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements. fair value measurements of non-marketable equity securities we measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, consisting primarily of our non-marketable equity securities. these investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative method (\"the measurement alternative\") and are measured at cost, less impairment, subject to upward and downward adjustments resulting from observable price changes for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. these adjustments require quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities, which may require the use of unobservable inputs. pricing adjustments are determined by using various valuation methodologies and involve the use of estimates using the best information available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data. non-marketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment, based on qualitative factors including the companies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among others. when indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach, which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs, including discount rates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. when the quantitative remeasurements of fair value indicate an impairment exists, we write down the investment to its current fair value. we also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments, i.e. performance fees. we record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may result in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use of unobservable inputs. property and equipment we assess the reasonableness of the useful lives of our property and equipment periodically as well as when other changes occur, such as when there are changes to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned use and utilization of assets, or technological advancements, that could indicate a change in the period over which we expect to benefit from the assets. alphabet inc. income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. recording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations, including evaluation of comparable and resolved tax exposures, applicability of tax laws, and likelihood of settlement. we evaluate uncertain tax positions periodically, considering changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made. the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties. in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue services (irs) and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. loss contingencies we are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury consumer protection, and other matters. certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. we record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. if we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. we evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures as appropriate. significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. change in accounting estimate in january 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment, resulting in a change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment to six years, which we expect to result in a reduction of depreciation of approximately $3.4 billion for the full fiscal year 2023 for assets in service as of december 31, 2022, recorded primarily in cost of revenues and r&d expenses. see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for information relating to the useful lives of our servers and network equipment.\"\"\"\n\n    Instruction:\n    Identify and summarize all sentences or phrases that are directly or indirectly related to \"organizational resilience\", including but not limited to:

2021. diluted earnings per common share (eps) was $30.06 for 2022, compared with $59.45 for 2021. return on average common shareholders' equity (roe) was 10.2% for 2022, compared with 23.0% for 2021. book value per common share was $303.55 as of december 2022, 6.7% higher compared with december 2021. net revenues were $47.37 billion for 2022, 20% lower than a strong 2021, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in asset & wealth management and lower net revenues in global banking & markets, partially offset by significantly higher net revenues in platform solutions. net revenues in asset & wealth management primarily reflected significantly lower net revenues in equity investments and debt investments. net revenues in global banking & markets primarily reflected significantly lower investment banking fees compared with a strong prior year, partially offset by significantly higher net revenues in fixed income, currency, and commodities (ficc). net revenues in platform solutions were significantly higher, primarily reflecting significantly higher net revenues in consumer platforms. provision for credit losses was $2.72 billion for 2022, compared with $357 million for 2021. provisions for 2022 primarily reflected growth in the credit card portfolio, the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns and net charge-offs. provisions for 2021 reflected growth in the credit card and wholesale portfolios, largely offset by reserve reductions as the broader economic environment continued to improve following the initial impact of the covid-19 pandemic. operating expenses were $31.16 billion for 2022, 2% lower than 2021, primarily due to lower compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting a decline in operating performance compared with a strong prior year). this decrease was partially offset by higher non-compensation expenses, reflecting the inclusion of nn investment partners (nnip) and greensky, inc. (greensky) and increases in transaction based expenses and technology expenses. our efficiency ratio (total operating expenses divided by total net revenues) was 65.8% for 2022, compared with 53.8% for 2021. during 2022, we returned a total of $6.70 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $3.50 billion and common stock dividends of $3.20 billion. as of december 2022, our cet1 capital ratio was 15.1% under the standardized capital rules and 14.4% under the advanced capital rules. see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our capital ratios. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis business environment in 2022, the global economy was impacted by persistent broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns, including russia's invasion of ukraine and the ongoing war, and inflationary and labor market pressures. governments around the world responded to russia's invasion of ukraine by imposing economic sanctions, and global central banks sought to address inflation by increasing policy interest rates several times over the course of the year. these factors contributed to increased market volatility during the year, as well as a decrease in global equity and bond prices and wider corporate credit spreads compared with the end of 2021. the economic outlook remains uncertain, reflecting concerns about the continuation or escalation of the war between russia and ukraine and other geopolitical risks, inflation, and supply chain complications. see \"results of operations - segment assets and operating results - segment operating results\" for further information about the operating environment for each of our business segments. critical accounting policies fair value fair value hierarchy. trading assets and liabilities, certain investments and loans, and certain other financial assets and liabilities, are included in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value (i.e., marked-to-market), with related gains or losses generally recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings. the use of fair value to measure financial instruments is fundamental to our risk management practices and is our most critical accounting policy. the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. we measure certain financial assets and liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to market and/or credit risks). in determining fair value, the hierarchy under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap) gives (i) the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities (level 1 inputs), (ii) the next priority to inputs other than level 1 inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly (level 2 inputs), and (iii) the lowest priority to inputs that cannot be observed in market activity (level 3 inputs). in evaluating the significance of a valuation input, we consider, among other factors, a portfolio's net risk exposure to that input. assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair value measurement. the fair values for substantially all of our financial assets and liabilities are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. certain level 2 and level 3 financial assets and liabilities may require appropriate valuation adjustments that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value for factors, such as counterparty and our credit quality, funding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads. instruments classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are those which require one or more significant inputs that are not observable. level 3 financial assets represented 1.8% as of december 2022 and 1.6% as of december 2021 of our total assets. see notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about level 3 financial assets, including changes in level 3 financial assets and related fair value measurements. absent evidence to the contrary, instruments classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are initially valued at transaction price, which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value. subsequent to the transaction date, we use other methodologies to determine fair value, which vary based on the type of instrument. estimating the fair value of level 3 financial instruments requires judgments to be made. these judgments include: •determining the appropriate valuation methodology and/or model for each type of level 3 financial instrument; •determining model inputs based on an evaluation of all relevant empirical market data, including prices evidenced by market transactions, interest rates, credit spreads, volatilities and correlations; and •determining appropriate valuation adjustments, including those related to illiquidity or counterparty credit quality. regardless of the methodology, valuation inputs and assumptions are only changed when corroborated by substantive evidence. controls over valuation of financial instruments. market makers and investment professionals in our revenue-producing units are responsible for pricing our financial instruments. our control infrastructure is independent of the revenue-producing units and is fundamental to ensuring that all of our financial instruments are appropriately valued at market-clearing levels. in the event that there is a difference of opinion in situations where estimating the fair value of financial instruments requires judgment (e.g., calibration to market comparables or trade comparison, as described below), the final valuation decision is made by senior managers in independent risk oversight and control functions. this independent price verification is critical to ensuring that our financial instruments are properly valued. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis price verification. all financial instruments at fair value classified in levels 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy are subject to our independent price verification process. the objective of price verification is to have an informed and independent opinion with regard to the valuation of financial instruments under review. instruments that have one or more significant inputs which cannot be corroborated by external market data are classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. price verification strategies utilized by our independent risk oversight and control functions include: •trade comparison. analysis of trade data (both internal and external, where available) is used to determine the most relevant pricing inputs and valuations. •external price comparison. valuations and prices are compared to pricing data obtained from third parties (e.g., brokers or dealers, s&p global services, bloomberg, ice data services, pricing direct, trace). data obtained from various sources is compared to ensure consistency and validity. when broker or dealer quotations or third-party pricing vendors are used for valuation or price verification, greater priority is generally given to executable quotations. •calibration to market comparables. market-based transactions are used to corroborate the valuation of positions with similar characteristics, risks and components. •relative value analyses. market-based transactions are analyzed to determine the similarity, measured in terms of risk, liquidity and return, of one instrument relative to another or, for a given instrument, of one maturity relative to another. •collateral analyses. margin calls on derivatives are analyzed to determine implied values, which are used to corroborate our valuations. •execution of trades. where appropriate, market-making desks are instructed to execute trades in order to provide evidence of market-clearing levels. •backtesting. valuations are corroborated by comparison to values realized upon sales. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about fair value measurements. review of net revenues. independent risk oversight and control functions ensure adherence to our pricing policy through a combination of daily procedures, including the explanation and attribution of net revenues based on the underlying factors. through this process, we independently validate net revenues, identify and resolve potential fair value or trade booking issues on a timely basis and seek to ensure that risks are being properly categorized and quantified. review of valuation models. our independent model risk management group (model risk), consisting of quantitative professionals who are separate from model developers, performs an independent model review and validation process of our valuation models. new or changed models are reviewed and approved prior to implementation. models are reviewed annually to assess the impact of any changes in the product or market and any market developments in pricing theories. see \"risk management - model risk management\" for further information about the review and validation of our valuation models. allowance for credit losses we estimate and record an allowance for credit losses related to our loans held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost. to determine the allowance for credit losses, we classify our loans accounted for at amortized cost into wholesale and consumer portfolios. these portfolios represent the level at which we have developed and documented our methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. the allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics using a modeled approach and on an asset-specific basis for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics. the allowance for credit losses takes into account the weighted average of a range of forecasts of future economic conditions over the expected life of the loans and lending commitments. the expected life of each loan or lending commitment is determined based on the contractual term adjusted for extension options or demand features, or is modeled in the case of revolving credit card loans. the forecasts include baseline, favorable and adverse economic scenarios over a three-year period. for loans with expected lives beyond three years, the model reverts to historical loss information based on a non-linear modeled approach. we apply judgment in weighting individual scenarios each quarter based on a variety of factors, including our internally derived economic outlook, market consensus, recent macroeconomic conditions and industry trends. the forecasted economic scenarios consider a number of risk factors relevant to the wholesale and consumer portfolios. risk factors for wholesale loans include internal credit ratings, industry default and loss data, expected life, macroeconomic indicators (e.g., unemployment rates and gdp), the borrower's capacity to meet its financial obligations, the borrower's country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. in addition, for loans backed by real estate, risk factors include loan-to-value ratio, debt service ratio and home price index. risk factors for installment and credit card loans include fair isaac corporation (fico) credit scores, delinquency status, loan vintage and macroeconomic indicators. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis the allowance for credit losses also includes qualitative components which allow management to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, capture uncertainty regarding model inputs, and account for model imprecision and concentration risk. our estimate of credit losses entails judgment about collectability at the reporting dates, and there are uncertainties inherent in those judgments. the allowance for credit losses is subject to a governance process that involves review and approval by senior management within our independent risk oversight and control functions. personnel within our independent risk oversight and control functions are responsible for forecasting the economic variables that underlie the economic scenarios that are used in the modeling of expected credit losses. while we use the best information available to determine this estimate, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on, among other things, changes in the economic environment or variances between actual results and the original assumptions used. loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when deemed to be uncollectible. we also record an allowance for credit losses on lending commitments which are held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost. such allowance is determined using the same methodology as the allowance for loan losses, while also taking into consideration the probability of drawdowns or funding, and whether such commitments are cancellable by us. to estimate the potential impact of an adverse macroeconomic environment on our allowance for credit losses, we, among other things, compared the expected credit losses under the weighted average forecast used in the calculation of allowance for credit losses as of december 2022 (which was weighted towards the baseline and adverse economic scenarios) to the expected credit losses under a 100% weighted adverse economic scenario. the adverse economic scenario of the forecast model reflects a global recession in 2023 and a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy by central banks, resulting in an economic contraction and rising unemployment rates. a 100% weighting to the adverse economic scenario would have resulted in an approximate $1.0 billion increase in our allowance for credit losses as of december 2022. this hypothetical increase does not take into consideration any potential adjustments to qualitative reserves. the forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain and do not take into account any other offsetting or correlated effects. the actual credit loss in an adverse macroeconomic environment may differ significantly from this estimate. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the allowance for credit losses. use of estimates u.s. gaap requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions. in addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the allowance for credit losses on loans and lending commitments held for investment and accounted for at amortized cost, the use of estimates and assumptions is also important in determining the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, provisions for losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings (including governmental investigations), and accounting for income taxes. goodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist. when assessing goodwill for impairment, first, a qualitative assessment can be made to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. if the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is performed. alternatively, a quantitative goodwill test can be performed without performing a qualitative assessment. estimating the fair value of our reporting units requires judgment. critical inputs to the fair value estimates include projected earnings and allocated equity. there is inherent uncertainty in the projected earnings. the carrying value of each reporting unit reflects an allocation of total shareholders' equity and represents the estimated amount of total shareholders' equity required to support the activities of the reporting unit under currently applicable regulatory capital requirements. the estimated fair value of our consumer platforms reporting unit, which represents approximately 7.5% of our goodwill, was not substantially in excess of its carrying value. this reporting unit has been adversely impacted by the recent operating environment generally characterized by broad macroeconomic concerns. we will continue to closely monitor it to determine whether an impairment is required in the future. as of december 2022, the goodwill related to the consumer platforms reporting unit was $482 million. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about goodwill. if we experience a prolonged or severe period of weakness in the business environment, financial markets, the performance of one or more of our reporting units or our common stock price, or additional increases in capital requirements, our goodwill could be impaired in the future. identifiable intangible assets are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset's or asset group's carrying value may not be fully recoverable. judgment is required to evaluate whether indications of potential impairment have occurred, and to test identifiable intangible assets for impairment, if required. an impairment is recognized if the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about identifiable intangible assets. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis we also estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. in addition, we estimate the upper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss in excess of the related reserves for litigation and regulatory proceedings where we believe the risk of loss is more than slight. see notes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements for information about certain judicial, litigation and regulatory proceedings. significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different. our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-by-case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, proceeding or investigation, our experience and the experience of others in similar cases, proceedings or investigations, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. in accounting for income taxes, we recognize tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. as of december 2022, our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $1.22 billion. we use estimates to recognize current and deferred income taxes in the u.s. federal, state and local and non-u.s. jurisdictions in which we operate. the income tax laws in these jurisdictions are complex and can be subject to different interpretations between taxpayers and taxing authorities. disputes may arise over these interpretations and can be settled by audit, administrative appeals or judicial proceedings. our interpretations are reevaluated quarterly based on guidance currently available, tax examination experience and the opinions of legal counsel, among other factors. we recognize deferred taxes based on the amount that will more likely than not be realized in the future based on enacted income tax laws. as of december 2022, we had $8.93 billion of deferred tax assets with a related valuation allowance of $1.57 billion. our estimate for deferred taxes includes estimates for future taxable earnings, including the level and character of those earnings, and various tax planning strategies. see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about income taxes. recent accounting developments see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for information about recent accounting developments. results of operations the composition of our net revenues has varied over time as financial markets and the scope of our operations

wealth management. •commissions and fees consists of revenues from executing and clearing client transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide, as well as over-the-counter (otc) transactions. substantially all of these activities are included in global banking & markets. •market making consists of revenues (excluding net interest) from client execution activities related to making markets in interest rate products, credit products, mortgages, currencies, commodities and equity products. these activities are included in global banking & markets. •other principal transactions consists of revenues (excluding net interest) from our equity investing activities, including revenues related to our consolidated investments (included in asset & wealth management), and debt investing and lending activities (included across our three segments). operating environment. during 2022, the operating environment was characterized by broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns and market volatility, which contributed to a decrease in global equity and bond prices and wider corporate credit spreads compared with the end of 2021. these factors contributed to solid market-making activity levels and a decline in industry-wide investment banking activity, particularly for underwriting. in the u.s., the rate of unemployment remained low and consumer spending increased slightly compared with 2021. if concerns about the economic outlook grow, including those about the continuation or escalation of geopolitical concerns, inflation and supply chain complications, and the persistence of covid-19-related effects, it may lead to a continued decline in asset prices, or a decline in market-making activity levels, or a continued decline in investment banking activity levels, and net revenues and provision for credit losses would likely be negatively impacted. see \"segment assets and operating results - segment operating results\" for information about the operating environment and material trends and uncertainties that may impact our results of operations. 2022 versus 2021 net revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $47.37 billion for 2022, 20% lower than a strong 2021, primarily reflecting significantly lower other principal transactions revenues and investment banking revenues, partially offset by significantly higher market making revenues. non-interest revenues. investment banking revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $7.36 billion for 2022, 48% lower than a strong 2021, due to significantly lower revenues in both equity and debt underwriting, reflecting a significant decline in industry-wide volumes, and lower revenues in advisory, reflecting a decline in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions transactions from elevated activity levels in the prior year. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis investment management revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $9.01 billion for 2022, 10% higher than 2021, due to higher management and other fees, reflecting the inclusion of nnip and a reduction in fee waivers on money market funds. commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of earnings were $4.03 billion for 2022, 12% higher than 2021, primarily due to higher commissions and fees in equities, reflecting generally higher volumes. market making revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $18.63 billion for 2022, 21% higher than 2021, primarily reflecting significantly higher revenues in interest rate products, currencies and commodities, partially offset by lower revenues in equity products. other principal transactions revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $654 million for 2022, compared with $11.62 billion for 2021, primarily reflecting significantly lower net gains from investments in private equities, significant mark-to-market net losses from investments in public equities and net mark-downs in debt investments compared with net mark-ups in 2021. net interest income. net interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings was $7.68 billion for 2022, 19% higher than 2021, reflecting an increase in interest income primarily related to collateralized agreements, other interest-earning assets and deposits with banks, each reflecting the impact of higher average interest rates, and loans, reflecting the impact of higher average balances and higher average interest rates. the increase in interest income was partially offset by an increase in interest expense primarily related to other interest-bearing liabilities, collateralized financings, and borrowings, each reflecting the impact of higher average interest rates, and deposits, reflecting the impact of higher average interest rates and higher average balances. see \"statistical disclosures - distribution of assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity\" for further information about our sources of net interest income. 2021 versus 2020 net revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $59.34 billion for 2021, 33% higher than 2020, reflecting significantly higher other principal transactions revenues, investment banking revenues and net interest income, and higher investment management revenues. non-interest revenues. investment banking revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $14.14 billion for 2021, 55% higher than 2020, due to significantly higher revenues in advisory, reflecting a significant increase in completed mergers and acquisitions volumes, in equity underwriting, primarily driven by strong industry-wide initial public offerings activity, and in debt underwriting, primarily reflecting elevated industry-wide leveraged finance activity. investment management revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $8.17 billion for 2021, 17% higher than 2020, primarily due to higher management and other fees, reflecting the impact of higher average assets under supervision, partially offset by higher fee waivers on money market funds. in addition, incentive fees were significantly higher, primarily driven by harvesting. commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of earnings were $3.59 billion for 2021, essentially unchanged compared with 2020. market making revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $15.36 billion for 2021, essentially unchanged compared with 2020, as significantly lower revenues in interest rate products and credit products were largely offset by significantly higher revenues in equity products (primarily in derivatives) and commodities, and improved results in mortgages. other principal transactions revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $11.62 billion for 2021, compared with $4.76 billion for 2020, primarily reflecting significantly higher net gains from investments in private equities and in debt instruments, partially offset by net losses from investments in public equities compared with significant net gains in 2020. net interest income. net interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings was $6.47 billion for 2021, 36% higher than 2020, reflecting a decrease in interest expense, partially offset by a decrease in interest income. the decrease in interest expense is primarily related to other interest-bearing liabilities, deposits and long-term borrowings, each reflecting the impact of lower interest rates. the decrease in interest income primarily related to collateralized agreements and trading assets, both reflecting the impact of lower interest rates, partially offset by the impact of higher average balances for loans. see \"supplemental financial information - statistical disclosures - distribution of assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity\" for further information about our sources of net interest income. provision for credit losses provision for credit losses consists of provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments held for investment and accounted for at amortized cost. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the provision for credit losses. the table below presents our provision for credit losses. year ended december $ in millions 2022 2021 2020 provision for credit losses $2,715 $357 $3,098 goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis 2022 versus 2021. provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of earnings was $2.72 billion for 2022, compared with $357 million for 2021. provisions for 2022 primarily reflected growth in the credit card portfolio, the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns and net charge-offs. provisions for 2021 reflected portfolio growth in the credit card and wholesale portfolios, largely offset by reserve reductions as the broader economic environment continued to improve following the initial impact of the covid-19 pandemic. 2021 versus 2020. provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of earnings was $357 million for 2021, compared with $3.10 billion for 2020. provisions for 2021 reflected portfolio growth (primarily in credit cards, including approximately $185 million of provisions related to the commitment to acquire the general motors co-branded credit card portfolio), largely offset by reserve reductions on wholesale and consumer loans reflecting continued improvement in the broader economic environment. this followed challenging conditions in the prior year as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, which contributed to significant provisions in 2020. operating expenses our operating expenses are primarily influenced by compensation, headcount and levels of business activity. compensation and benefits includes salaries, year-end discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as benefits. discretionary compensation is significantly impacted by, among other factors, the level of net revenues, net of provision for credit losses, overall financial performance, prevailing labor markets, business mix, the structure of our share-based compensation programs and the external environment. the table below presents our operating expenses by line item and headcount. year ended december $ in millions 2022 2021 2020 compensation and benefits $15,148 $17,719 $13,309 transaction based 5,312 4,710 4,141 market

billion for 2022, 2% lower than 2021. our efficiency ratio was 65.8% for 2022, compared with our medium-term target efficiency ratio of approximately 60%. our efficiency ratio was 53.8% for 2021. the decrease in operating expenses compared with 2021 was primarily due to lower compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting a decline in operating performance compared with a strong prior year). this decrease was partially offset by higher non-compensation expenses, reflecting the inclusion of nnip and greensky and increases in transaction based expenses and technology expenses. while certain expenses (e.g., compensation and benefits, occupancy and market development) were impacted by inflationary pressures, the overall impact of higher inflation was not material to our operating expenses for 2022. net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings were $576 million for 2022 compared with $534 million for 2021. headcount increased 10% during 2022, primarily reflecting investments in growth initiatives and the acquisitions of nnip and greensky. 2021 versus 2020. operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $31.94 billion for 2021, 10% higher than 2020. our efficiency ratio was 53.8% for 2021, compared with 65.0% for 2020. in 2020, net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings increased our efficiency ratio by 7.6 percentage points. the increase in operating expenses compared with 2020 primarily reflected significantly higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting strong performance). in addition, technology expenses and professional fees were significantly higher and transaction based expenses were higher. these increases were partially offset by significantly lower net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings and lower expenses related to consolidated investments (including impairments). net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings were $534 million for 2021 compared with $3.42 billion for 2020. charitable contributions to goldman sachs gives were approximately $250 million for 2021. headcount increased 8% during 2021, reflecting investments in growth initiatives and an increase in technology professionals. the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis provision for taxes the effective income tax rate for 2022 was 16.5%, down from the full year income tax rate of 20.0% for 2021, primarily due to an increase in the impact of permanent tax benefits, partially offset by changes in the geographic mix of earnings in 2022 compared with 2021. the u.k. finance act 2021 increased the corporate income tax rate by six percent and the finance act 2022 decreased the u.k. bank surcharge tax rate by five percent effective from april 1, 2023. as a result, beginning april 1, 2023, the u.k. tax rate for our u.k. regulated broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries and branches, including goldman sachs international (gsi) and goldman sachs international bank (gsib), will increase by one percent and the u.k. tax rate for all other u.k. subsidiaries and branches will increase by six percent. during 2022, following royal assent of finance act 2022, certain u.k. deferred tax assets and liabilities were remeasured and a net reduction in deferred tax assets of approximately $50 million was recognized. in august 2022, the inflation reduction act of 2022 was signed into law. the inflation reduction act of 2022 includes income tax incentives to encourage investments in clean energy and a new 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (camt). the camt applies to corporations with average annual profits over $1 billion and is calculated on their financial statement income, with certain adjustments, for years beginning after december 31, 2022. the legislation had no impact on our 2022 annual effective tax rate and based on our current understanding of the camt, is not expected to have a material impact on our 2023 annual effective tax rate. segment assets and operating results segment assets. the table below presents assets by segment. as of december $ in millions 2022 2021 global banking &amp; markets $1,169,539 $1,201,996

securities trading activities through margin loans that are collateralized by securities, cash or other acceptable collateral and provide securities-based loans to individuals. in addition, we execute swap transactions to provide our clients with exposure to securities and indices. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis market-making activities as a market maker, we facilitate transactions in both liquid and less liquid markets, primarily for institutional clients, such as corporations, financial institutions, investment funds and governments, to assist clients in meeting their investment objectives and in managing their risks. in this role, we seek to earn the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing to sell an instrument to us and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it from us, and vice versa (i.e., bid/offer spread). in addition, we maintain (i) market-making positions, typically for a short period of time, in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand, and (ii) positions to actively manage our risk exposures that arise from these market-making activities (collectively, inventory). our inventory is recorded in trading assets (long positions) or trading liabilities (short positions) in our consolidated balance sheets. our results are influenced by a combination of interconnected drivers, including (i) client activity levels and transactional bid/offer spreads (collectively, client activity), and (ii) changes in the fair value of our inventory and interest income and interest expense related to the holding, hedging and funding of our inventory (collectively, market-making inventory changes). due to the integrated nature of our market-making activities, disaggregation of net revenues into client activity and market-making inventory changes is judgmental and has inherent complexities and limitations. the amount and composition of our net revenues vary over time as these drivers are impacted by multiple interrelated factors affecting economic and market conditions, including volatility and liquidity in the market, changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit spreads, equity prices and commodity prices, investor confidence, and other macroeconomic concerns and uncertainties. in general, assuming all other market-making conditions remain constant, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads tend to result in increases in net revenues, and decreases tend to have the opposite effect. however, changes in market-making conditions can materially impact client activity levels and bid/offer spreads, as well as the fair value of our inventory. for example, a decrease in liquidity in the market could have the impact of (i) increasing our bid/offer spread, (ii) decreasing investor confidence and thereby decreasing client activity levels, and (iii) widening of credit spreads on our inventory positions. other. we lend to corporate clients, including through relationship lending and acquisition financing. the hedges related to this lending and financing activity are also reported as part of other. other also includes equity and debt investing activities related to our global banking & markets activities. the table below presents our global banking & markets

banking & markets operated in an environment generally characterized by broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns and market volatility, which negatively affected industry-wide investment banking activity levels, particularly for underwriting, but contributed to solid market-making activity levels. in investment banking, compared with 2021, industry-wide equity underwriting volumes were low amid volatile equity markets and a decline in prices, and industry-wide debt underwriting volumes declined across leveraged finance and investment grade issuances amid rising interest rates. additionally, industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions transactions declined from elevated levels in the prior year. for volatility, the average daily vix was 30% higher compared with 2021. in equities, the s&p 500 index decreased by 19% and the msci world index decreased by 20%, compared with the end of 2021. additionally, global central banks sought to address inflation by increasing policy interest rates several times over the course of the year. in the future, if market and economic conditions deteriorate further, and activity levels or volatility decline, or credit spreads related to hedges on our relationship lending portfolio tighten, net revenues in global banking & markets would likely be negatively impacted. in addition, if economic conditions deteriorate further or if the creditworthiness of borrowers deteriorates, provision for credit losses would likely be negatively impacted. 2022 versus 2021. net revenues in global banking & markets were $32.49 billion for 2022, 12% lower than a strong 2021. investment banking fees were $7.36 billion, 48% lower than a strong 2021, due to significantly lower net revenues in both equity and debt underwriting, reflecting a significant decline in industry-wide volumes, and lower net revenues in advisory, reflecting a decline in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions transactions from elevated activity levels in the prior year. as of december 2022, our investment banking fees backlog decreased significantly compared with the end of 2021, primarily due to significantly lower estimated net revenues from both potential advisory transactions and potential debt underwriting transactions (primarily from leveraged finance transactions). our backlog represents an estimate of our net revenues from future transactions where we believe that future revenue realization is more likely than not. we believe changes in our backlog may be a useful indicator of client activity levels which, over the long term, impact our net revenues. however, the time frame for completion and corresponding revenue recognition of transactions in our backlog varies based on the nature of the assignment, as certain transactions may remain in our backlog for longer periods of time. in addition, our backlog is subject to certain limitations, such as assumptions about the likelihood that individual client transactions will occur in the future. transactions may be cancelled or modified, and transactions not included in the estimate may also occur. net revenues in ficc were $14.68 billion, 38% higher than 2021, primarily reflecting significantly higher net revenues in ficc intermediation, driven by significantly higher net revenues in interest rate products, currencies and commodities, partially offset by significantly lower net revenues in mortgages and lower net revenues in credit products. in addition, net revenues in ficc financing were significantly higher, primarily driven by secured lending. the increase in ficc intermediation net revenues reflected significantly higher client activity as we supported clients amid an evolving macroeconomic environment. the following provides information about our ficc intermediation net revenues by business, compared with 2021 results: •net revenues in interest rate products, currencies and commodities primarily reflected higher client activity. •net revenues in mortgages and credit products primarily reflected the impact of challenging market-making conditions on our inventory. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis net revenues in equities were $10.99 billion, 6% lower than 2021, due to lower net revenues in equities intermediation, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in cash products and lower net revenues in derivatives. net revenues in equities financing were higher, primarily reflecting increased client activity. net revenues in other were $(537) million for 2022, compared with $265 million for 2021, reflecting significantly lower net gains from investments in equities and net mark-downs on acquisition financing activities. provision for credit losses was $468 million for 2022, compared with a net benefit of $171 million for 2021. provisions for 2022 primarily reflected the impact of broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns, while the net benefit for 2021 reflected reserve reductions as the broad economic environment continued to improve following the initial impact of the covid-19 pandemic, partially offset by growth in the portfolio. operating expenses were $17.85 billion for 2022, 9% lower than 2021, reflecting lower compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting a decline in operating performance compared with a strong prior year). pre-tax earnings were $14.17 billion for 2022, 18% lower than 2021. 2021 versus 2020. net revenues in global banking & markets were $36.73 billion for 2021, 21% higher than 2020. investment banking fees were $14.14 billion, 55% higher than 2020, due to significantly higher net revenues in advisory, reflecting a significant increase in completed mergers and acquisitions volumes, in equity underwriting, primarily driven by strong industry-wide initial public offerings activity, and in debt underwriting, primarily reflecting elevated industry-wide leveraged finance activity. as of december 2021, our investment banking fees backlog increased significantly compared with december 2020, due to significantly higher estimated net revenues from potential advisory transactions and potential debt underwriting transactions (particularly from leveraged finance transactions), and higher estimated net revenues from potential equity underwriting transactions. net revenues in ficc were $10.61 billion, 7% lower than 2020, due to lower net revenues in ficc intermediation, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in interest rate products and credit products and slightly lower net revenues in currencies, partially offset by significantly higher net revenues in mortgages and higher net revenues in commodities. net revenues in ficc financing were significantly higher, reflecting significantly higher net revenues from secured lending, partially offset by significantly lower net revenues from resale agreements. the decrease in ficc intermediation net revenues reflected strong but significantly lower client activity compared with very strong activity levels in the prior year due to high volatility amid the covid-19 pandemic. this was partially offset by the impact of improved market-making conditions on our inventory compared with challenging conditions in the prior year. the following provides information about our ficc intermediation net revenues by business, compared with 2020 results: •net revenues in interest rate products primarily reflected lower client activity. •net revenues in credit products and currencies reflected lower client activity, partially offset by the impact of improved market-making conditions on our inventory. •net revenues in mortgages reflected the impact of improved market-making conditions on our inventory. •net revenues in commodities primarily reflected higher client activity. net revenues in equities were $11.72 billion, 19% higher than 2020, due to significantly higher net revenues in equities financing, primarily reflecting increased activity (including higher average client balances), and higher net revenues in equities intermediation, primarily reflecting higher net revenues in derivatives. net revenues in other were $265 million for 2021, compared with $32 million for 2020, primarily reflecting significantly higher net gains from investments in equities. provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $171 million for 2021, compared with net provisions of $1.22 billion for 2020, primarily due to reserve reductions in the year reflecting continued improvement in the broad economic environment following challenging conditions in 2020 resulting from the covid-19 pandemic, partially offset by portfolio growth. operating expenses were $19.54 billion for 2021, 3% higher than 2020, primarily due to significantly higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting strong performance) and higher transaction based expenses, largely offset by significantly lower net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings. pre-tax earnings were $17.36 billion, 67% higher than 2020. roe was 22.5% for 2021, compared with 13.6% for 2020 (which included the impact of net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings that reduced roe by 5.4 percentage points). goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries

an environment generally characterized by broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns and market volatility, which contributed to a decrease in asset prices compared to the end of 2021, negatively affecting assets under supervision and investments. additionally, global central banks sought to address inflation by increasing policy interest rates several times over the course of the year. in the future, if market and economic conditions deteriorate further, it may lead to a continued decline in asset prices, or investors transitioning to asset classes that typically generate lower fees or withdrawing their assets or deposits, and net revenues in asset & wealth management would likely continue to be negatively impacted. 2022 versus 2021. net revenues in asset & wealth management were $13.38 billion for 2022, 39% lower than 2021, primarily reflecting significantly lower net revenues in equity investments and debt investments. broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns during the year led to a decline in global equity prices and wider credit spreads. as a result, net revenues in equity investments reflected significantly lower net gains from investments in private equities and significant mark-to-market net losses from investments in public equities. the decrease in debt investments net revenues reflected net mark-downs compared with net mark-ups in the prior year and lower net interest income. incentive fees were significantly lower, primarily driven by harvesting in the prior year. management and other fees were higher, reflecting the inclusion of nnip and a reduction in fee waivers on money market funds. private banking and lending net revenues were significantly higher, primarily reflecting higher deposit spreads, as well as higher loan and deposit balances. provision for credit losses was $519 million for 2022, compared with a net benefit of $169 million for 2021. provisions for 2022 primarily reflected the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns, while the net benefit for 2021 reflected reserve reductions as the broad economic environment continued to improve following the initial impact of the covid-19 pandemic. operating expenses were $11.55 billion for 2022, essentially unchanged compared with 2021, reflecting the inclusion of operating expenses related to nnip, largely offset by lower compensation and benefits expenses. pre-tax earnings were $1.31 billion for 2022, compared with $10.73 billion for 2021. 2021 versus 2020. net revenues in asset & wealth management were $21.97 billion for 2021, 60% higher than 2020, primarily reflecting significantly higher net revenues in equity investments and debt investments, and higher management and other fees. the increase in equity investments net revenues reflected significantly higher net gains from investments in private equities, driven by company-specific events and improved corporate performance compared with 2020, partially offset by net losses from investments in public equities compared with significant net gains in the prior year. the increase in debt investments net revenues reflected net mark-ups compared with net mark-downs in the prior year, and significantly higher net interest income. the increase in management and other fees reflected the impact of higher average assets under supervision, partially offset by higher fee waivers on money market funds. private banking and lending net revenues were higher, primarily reflecting higher deposit balances. incentive fees were significantly higher, primarily driven by harvesting. provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $169 million for 2021, compared with net provisions of $1.40 billion for 2020, primarily due to reserve reductions in the year reflecting continued improvement in the broad economic environment following challenging conditions in 2020 resulting from the covid-19 pandemic. 74 goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and

benchmark or other performance targets. these incentive fees are recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur. our estimated unrecognized incentive fees were $3.33 billion as of december 2022, $3.39 billion as of december 2021 and $1.79 billion as of december 2020. such amounts are based on the completion of the funds' financial statements, which is

generally when such fees are no longer subject to fluctuations in the market value of the assets. our target is to achieve annual firmwide management and other fees of more than $10 billion (including

rate of unemployment remained low and consumer spending increased slightly compared with 2021. additionally, global central banks sought to address inflation by increasing policy interest rates several times over the course of the year. in the future, if market and economic conditions deteriorate further, it may lead to a decrease in consumer spending or a deterioration in consumer credit, and net revenues and provision for credit losses in platform solutions would likely be negatively impacted. 2022 versus 2021. net revenues in platform solutions were $1.50 billion for 2022, 135% higher than 2021, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in both consumer platforms and transaction banking and other. the increase in consumer platforms net revenues primarily reflected significantly higher credit card balances. the increase in transaction banking and other net revenues reflected higher deposit balances. provision for credit losses was $1.73 billion for 2022, compared with $697 million for 2021. provisions for 2022 primarily reflected growth in the credit card portfolio and net charge offs, while 2021 primarily reflected growth in the credit card portfolio, which was partially offset by reserve reductions as the broad economic environment continued to improve following the initial impact of the covid-19 pandemic. operating expenses were $1.76 billion for 2022, 78% higher than 2021, reflecting higher spend on growth initiatives in consumer platforms, primarily from the inclusion of operating expenses related to greensky. pre-tax loss was $1.99 billion for 2022, compared with $1.05 billion for 2021. 2021 versus 2020. net revenues in platform solutions were $640 million for 2021, 92% higher than 2020, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in consumer platforms and higher net revenues in transaction banking and other. net revenues in consumer platforms reflected higher credit card balances. net revenues in transaction banking and other reflected higher deposit balances. provision for credit losses was $697 million for 2021, 43% higher than 2020, primarily reflecting growth in the credit card portfolio, including approximately $185 million of the provisions related to the commitment to acquire the general motors co-branded credit card portfolio, partially offset by reserve reductions in the year reflecting continued improvement in the broad economic environment following challenging conditions in 2020 resulting from the covid-19 pandemic. operating expenses were $990 million for 2021, 57% higher than 2020, primarily reflecting higher spend on growth initiatives in consumer platforms. pre-tax loss was $1.05 billion for 2021, compared with $783 million for 2020. geographic data see note 25 to the

subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis balance sheet and funding sources balance sheet management one of our risk management disciplines is our ability to manage the size and composition of our balance sheet. while our asset base changes due to client activity, market fluctuations and business opportunities, the size and composition of our balance sheet also reflects factors, including (i) our overall risk tolerance, (ii) the amount of capital we hold and (iii) our funding profile, among other factors. see \"capital management and regulatory capital - capital management\" for information about our capital management process. although our balance sheet fluctuates on a day-to-day basis, our total assets at quarter-end are generally not materially different from those occurring within our reporting periods. in order to ensure appropriate risk management, we seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid balance sheet and have processes in place to dynamically manage our assets and liabilities, which include (i) balance sheet planning, (ii) balance sheet limits, (iii) monitoring of key metrics and (iv) scenario analyses. balance sheet planning. we prepare a balance sheet plan that combines our projected total assets and composition of assets with our expected funding sources over a three-year time horizon. this plan is reviewed quarterly and may be adjusted in response to changing business needs or market conditions. the objectives of this planning process are: •to develop our balance sheet projections, taking into account the general state of the financial markets and expected business activity levels, as well as regulatory requirements; •to allow treasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions to objectively evaluate balance sheet limit requests from our revenue-producing units in the context of our overall balance sheet constraints, including our liability profile and capital levels, and key metrics; and •to inform the target amount, tenor and type of funding to raise, based on our projected assets and contractual maturities. treasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions, along with our revenue-producing units, review current and prior period information and expectations for the year to prepare our balance sheet plan. the specific information reviewed includes asset and liability size and composition, limit utilization, risk and performance measures, and capital usage. our consolidated balance sheet plan, including our balance sheets by business, funding projections and projected key metrics, is reviewed and approved by the firmwide asset liability committee and the firmwide risk appetite committee. see \"risk management - overview and structure of risk management\" for an overview of our risk management structure. balance sheet limits. the firmwide asset liability committee and the firmwide risk appetite committee have the responsibility to review and approve balance sheet limits. these limits are set at levels which are close to actual operating levels, rather than at levels which reflect our maximum risk appetite, in order to ensure prompt escalation and discussion among our revenue-producing units, treasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions on a routine basis. requests for changes in limits are evaluated after giving consideration to their impact on our key metrics. compliance with limits is monitored by our revenue-producing units and treasury, as well as our independent risk oversight and control functions. monitoring of key metrics. we monitor key balance sheet metrics both by business and on a consolidated basis, including asset and liability size and composition, limit utilization and risk measures. we attribute assets to businesses and review and analyze movements resulting from new business activity, as well as market fluctuations. scenario analyses. we conduct various scenario analyses, including as part of the comprehensive capital analysis and review (ccar) and u.s. dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act stress tests (dfast), as well as our resolution and recovery planning. see \"capital management and regulatory capital - capital management\" for further information about these scenario analyses. these scenarios cover short- and long-term time horizons using various macroeconomic and firm-specific assumptions, based on a range of economic scenarios. we use these analyses to assist us in developing our longer-term balance sheet management strategy, including the level and composition of assets, funding and capital. additionally, these analyses help us develop approaches for maintaining appropriate funding, liquidity and capital across a variety of situations, including a severely stressed environment. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis balance sheet analysis and metrics as of december 2022, total assets in our consolidated balance sheets were $1.44 trillion, a decrease of $22.19 billion from december 2021, reflecting decreases in trading assets of $74.67 billion (primarily due to decreases in equity securities, corporate debt instruments, reflecting the impact of our and our clients' activities), customer and other receivables of $25.23 billion (primarily reflecting client activity), cash and cash equivalents of $19.21 billion (primarily reflecting our activity), partially offset by increases in investments of $41.91 billion (primarily due to an increase in u.s. government obligations accounted for as held-to-maturity), collateralized agreements of $29.68 billion (primarily reflecting the impact of our and our clients' activities), and loans of $20.72 billion (reflecting increases in other collateralized and consumer loans). as of december 2022, total liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets were $1.32 trillion, a decrease of $29.45 billion from december 2021, reflecting decreases in collateralized financings of $75.91 billion (primarily reflecting the impact of our and our clients' activities), partially offset by increases in deposits of $22.44 billion (primarily due to increases in transaction banking and private bank and consumer deposits, partially offset by other deposits), customer and other payables of $10.11 billion (primarily reflecting client activity), and trading liabilities of $9.90 billion (primarily due to an increase in equity securities, partially offset by a decrease in government obligations, both reflecting the impact of our and our clients' activities). our total repurchase agreements, accounted for as collateralized financings, were $110.35 billion as of december 2022 and $165.88 billion as of december 2021, which were 15% lower as of december 2022 and 3% higher as of december 2021 than the average daily amount of repurchase agreements over the respective quarters, and 27% lower as of december 2022 and 14% higher as of december 2021 than the average daily amount of repurchase agreements over the respective years. as of december 2022, the decrease in our repurchase agreements relative to the average daily amount of repurchase agreements during the quarter and year resulted from lower levels of our and our clients' activities at the end of the period. the level of our repurchase agreements fluctuates between and within periods, primarily due to providing clients with access to highly liquid collateral, such as certain government and agency obligations, through collateralized financing activities. the table below presents information about our balance sheet and leverage ratios. as of december $ in millions 2022 2021 total assets

large, diverse creditor base in a variety of markets in the americas, europe and asia. we believe that our relationships with our creditors are critical to our liquidity. our creditors include banks, governments, securities lenders, corporations, pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds and individuals. we have imposed various internal guidelines to monitor creditor concentration across our funding programs. deposits. our deposits provide us with a diversified source of funding and reduce our reliance on wholesale funding. we raise deposits, including savings, demand and time deposits, from private bank clients, consumers, transaction banking clients, other institutional clients, and through internal and third-party broker-dealers. substantially all of our deposits are raised through gs bank usa, gsib and goldman sachs bank europe se (gsbe). see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our deposits, including a maturity profile of our time deposits. secured funding. we fund a significant amount of inventory and a portion of investments on a secured basis. secured funding includes collateralized financings in the consolidated balance sheets. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our collateralized financings, including its maturity profile. we may also pledge our inventory and investments as collateral for securities borrowed under a securities lending agreement. we also use our own inventory and investments to cover transactions in which we or our clients have sold securities that have not yet been purchased. secured funding is less sensitive to changes in our credit quality than unsecured funding, due to our posting of collateral to our lenders. nonetheless, we analyze the refinancing risk of our secured funding activities, taking into account trade tenors, maturity profiles, counterparty concentrations, collateral eligibility and counterparty rollover probabilities. we seek to mitigate our refinancing risk by executing term trades with staggered maturities, diversifying counterparties, raising excess secured funding and pre-funding residual risk through our gcla. we seek to raise secured funding with a term appropriate for the liquidity of the assets that are being financed, and we seek longer maturities for secured funding collateralized by asset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis, especially during times of market stress. our secured funding, excluding funding collateralized by liquid government and agency obligations, is primarily executed for tenors of one month or greater and is primarily executed through term repurchase agreements and securities loaned contracts. assets that may be harder to fund on a secured basis during times of market stress include certain financial instruments in the following categories: mortgage- and other asset-backed loans and securities, non-investment-grade corporate debt securities, equity securities and emerging market securities. we also raise financing through other types of collateralized financings, such as secured loans and notes. gs bank usa has access to funding from the federal home loan bank. we had no outstanding borrowings from the federal home loan bank as of december 2022 and $100 million as of december 2021. additionally, we have access to funding through the federal reserve discount window. however, we do not rely on this funding in our liquidity planning and stress testing. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc.

to mitigate refinancing risk, we seek to limit the principal amount of debt maturing over the course of any monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual time horizon. we enter into interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our unsecured long-term borrowings into floating-rate obligations to manage our exposure to interest rates. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unsecured long-term borrowings. we issued approximately $28 billion of benchmark debt during 2022, and we intend to issue significantly less benchmark debt in 2023 compared to our benchmark debt issuance in 2022, though actual issuances may differ due to business needs and market opportunities. shareholders' equity. shareholders' equity is a stable and perpetual source of funding. see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our shareholders' equity. capital management and regulatory capital capital adequacy is of critical importance to us. we have in place a comprehensive capital management policy that provides a framework, defines objectives and establishes guidelines to assist us in maintaining the appropriate level and composition of capital in both business-as-usual and stressed conditions. capital management we determine the appropriate amount and composition of our capital by considering multiple factors, including our current and future regulatory capital requirements, the results of our capital planning and stress testing process, the results of resolution capital models and other factors, such as rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment and conditions in the financial markets. we manage our capital requirements and the levels of our capital usage principally by setting limits on the balance sheet and/or limits on risk, in each case at both the firmwide and business levels. we principally manage the level and composition of our capital through issuances and repurchases of our common stock. we may issue, redeem or repurchase our preferred stock and subordinated debt or other forms of capital as business conditions warrant. prior to such redemptions or repurchases, we must receive approval from the frb. see notes 14 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our preferred stock and subordinated debt. capital planning and stress testing process. as part of capital planning, we project sources and uses of capital given a range of business environments, including stressed conditions. our stress testing process is designed to identify and measure material risks associated with our business activities, including market risk, credit risk, operational risk and liquidity risk, as well as our ability to generate revenues. our capital planning process incorporates an internal capital adequacy assessment with the objective of ensuring that we are appropriately capitalized relative to the risks in our businesses. we incorporate stress scenarios into our capital planning process with a goal of holding sufficient capital to ensure we remain adequately capitalized after experiencing a severe stress event. our assessment of capital adequacy is viewed in tandem with our assessment of liquidity adequacy and is integrated into our overall risk management structure, governance and policy framework. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis our stress tests incorporate our internally designed stress scenarios, including our internally developed severely adverse scenario, and those required by the frb, and are designed to capture our specific vulnerabilities and risks. we provide further information about our stress test processes and a summary of the results on our website as described in \"business - available information\" in part i, item 1 of this form 10-k. as required by the frb's ccar rules, we submit an annual capital plan for review by the frb. the purpose of the frb's review is to ensure that we have a robust, forward-looking capital planning process that accounts for our unique risks and that permits continued operation during times of economic and financial stress. the frb evaluates us based, in part, on whether we have the capital necessary to continue operating under the baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the frb and those developed internally. this evaluation also takes into account our process for identifying risk, our controls and governance for capital planning, and our guidelines for making capital planning decisions. in addition, the frb evaluates our plan to make capital distributions (i.e., dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions of stock, subordinated debt or other capital securities) and issue capital, across the range of macroeconomic scenarios and firm-specific assumptions. the frb determines the stress capital buffer (scb) applicable to us based on its own annual stress test. the scb under the standardized approach is calculated as (i) the difference between our starting and minimum projected cet1 capital ratios under the supervisory severely adverse scenario and (ii) our planned common stock dividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon, expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets (rwas). based on our 2022 ccar submission, the frb reduced our scb from 6.4% to 6.3% for the period from october 1, 2022 through september 30, 2023. as a result, beginning on october 1, 2022, our standardized cet1 capital ratio requirement was 13.3%. additionally, effective january 1, 2023, our g-sib surcharge increased from 2.5% to 3.0%, resulting in a standardized cet1 capital ratio requirement of 13.8%. see \"share repurchase program\" for further information about common stock repurchases and dividends and \"consolidated regulatory capital\" for further information about the g-sib surcharge. we published a summary of our annual dfast results in june 2022. see \"business - available information\" in part i, item 1 of this form 10-k. gs bank usa is required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis and publish a summary of certain results. gs bank usa published a summary of its annual dfast results in june 2022. see \"business - available information\" in part i, item 1 of this form 10-k. gsi, gsib and gsbe also have their own capital planning and stress testing processes, which incorporate internally designed stress tests developed in accordance with the guidelines of their respective regulators. contingency capital plan. as part of our comprehensive capital management policy, we maintain a contingency capital plan. our contingency capital plan provides a framework for analyzing and responding to a perceived or actual capital deficiency, including, but not limited to, identification of drivers of a capital deficiency, as well as mitigants and potential actions. it outlines the appropriate communication procedures to follow during a crisis period, including internal dissemination of information, as well as timely communication with external stakeholders. capital attribution. we assess the capital usage of each of our businesses based on our attributed equity framework. this framework considers many factors, including our internal assessment of risks as well as the regulatory capital requirements related to our business activities. these regulatory capital requirements take into consideration our most binding capital constraints. our most binding capital constraint is our cet1 capital ratio requirement under the standardized capital rules. this requirement includes the scb which is determined by the frb based on its own annual stress test. share repurchase program. we use our share repurchase program to help maintain the appropriate level of common equity. the repurchase program is effected primarily through regular open-market purchases (which may include repurchase plans designed to comply with rule 10b5-1 and accelerated share repurchases), the amounts and timing of which are determined primarily by our current and projected capital position and our capital plan submitted to the frb as part of ccar. the amounts and timing of the repurchases may also be influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of our common stock. in the third quarter of 2022, the board of directors of group inc. (board) approved an increase in our common stock dividend from $2.00 to $2.50 per share. during 2022, we returned a total of $6.70 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $3.50 billion and common stock dividends of $3.20 billion. during the fourth quarter of 2022, we returned a total of $2.38 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1.50 billion and common stock dividends of $880 million. consistent with our capital management philosophy, we will continue prioritizing deployment of capital for our clients where returns are attractive and return any excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. during the first quarter of 2023 through february 23, 2023, our common stock repurchases were approximately $2.25 billion. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis see \"market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities\" in part ii, item 5 of this form 10-k and note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our share repurchase program, and see above for information about our capital planning and stress testing process. in august 2022, the inflation reduction act of 2022 introduced a one percent non-deductible excise tax (buyback tax) on the fair market value of certain corporate share repurchases after december 31, 2022. the fair market value of share repurchases subject to the tax is reduced by the fair market value of any stock issued during the calendar year, including stock issued to employees. based on our current understanding, we do not expect the buyback tax to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in 2023. resolution capital models. in connection with our resolution planning efforts, we have established a resolution capital adequacy and positioning framework, which is designed to ensure that our major subsidiaries (gs bank usa, goldman sachs & co. llc (gs&co.), gsi, gsib, gsbe, goldman sachs japan co., ltd. (gsjcl), goldman sachs asset management, l.p. and goldman sachs asset management international) have access to sufficient loss-absorbing capacity (in the form of equity, subordinated debt and unsecured senior debt) so that they are able to wind down following a group inc. bankruptcy filing in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy. in addition, we have established a triggers and alerts framework, which is designed to provide the board with information needed to make an informed decision on whether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings for group inc. rating agency guidelines the credit rating agencies assign credit ratings to the obligations of group inc., which directly issues or guarantees substantially all of our senior unsecured debt obligations. gs&co. and gsi have been assigned long- and short-term issuer ratings by certain credit rating agencies. gs bank usa, gsib and gsbe have also been assigned long- and short-term issuer ratings, as well as ratings on their long- and short-term bank deposits. in addition, credit rating agencies have assigned ratings to debt obligations of certain other subsidiaries of group inc. the level and composition of our capital are among the many factors considered in determining our credit ratings. each agency has its own definition of eligible capital and methodology for evaluating capital adequacy, and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors rather than a single calculation. see \"risk management - liquidity risk management - credit ratings\" for further information about credit ratings of group inc., gs bank usa, gsib, gsbe, gs&co. and gsi. consolidated regulatory capital we are subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements which are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the frb (capital framework). under the capital framework, we are an \"advanced approaches\" banking organization and have been designated as a g-sib. the capital requirements calculated under the capital framework include the capital conservation buffer requirements, which are comprised of a 2.5% buffer (under the advanced capital rules), the scb (under the standardized capital rules), a countercyclical capital buffer (under both capital rules) and the g-sib surcharge (under both capital rules). our g-sib surcharge was 2.5% for 2022 and is 3.0% for 2023 and 2024. the g-sib surcharge and countercyclical capital buffer in the future may differ due to additional guidance from our regulators and/or positional changes, and our scb is likely to change from year to year based on the results of the annual supervisory stress tests. our target is to maintain capital ratios equal to the regulatory requirements plus a buffer of 50 to 100 basis points. see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios, and the capital framework. total loss-absorbing capacity (tlac) we are also subject to the frb's tlac and related requirements. failure to comply with the tlac and related requirements would result in restrictions being imposed by the frb and could limit our ability to repurchase shares, pay dividends and make certain discretionary compensation payments. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis the table

exposure 4.5 % in the table above: •the tlac to rwas requirement included (i) the 18% minimum, (ii) the 2.5% buffer, (iii) the countercyclical capital buffer, which the frb has set to zero percent and (iv) the 1.0% g-sib surcharge (method 1). beginning in january 2023, our tlac to rwas requirement increased to 22.0%. •the tlac to leverage exposure requirement includes (i) the 7.5% minimum and (ii) the 2.0% leverage exposure buffer. •the external long-term debt to rwas requirement includes (i) the 6% minimum and (ii) the 2.5% g-sib surcharge (method 2). beginning in january 2023, our external

table above: •tlac includes common and preferred stock, and eligible long-term debt issued by group inc. eligible long-term debt represents unsecured debt, which has a remaining maturity of at least one year and satisfies additional requirements. •external long-term debt consists of eligible long-term debt subject to a haircut if it is due to be paid between one and two years. •rwas represent advanced rwas as of december 2022 and standardized rwas as of december 2021. in accordance with the tlac rules, the higher of advanced or standardized rwas are used in the calculation of tlac and external long-term debt ratios and applicable requirements. •leverage exposure consists of average adjusted total assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures. in the second half of 2022, based on regulatory feedback, we revised certain interpretations of the capital rules underlying the calculation of standardized rwas. as of december 2021, this change would have reduced our tlac to rwas ratio of 44.0% by 0.8 percentage points and our external long-term debt to rwas ratio of 25.8% by 0.5 percentage points. see \"business - regulation\" in part i, item 1 of this form 10-k for further information about tlac. subsidiary capital requirements many of our subsidiaries, including our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to separate regulation and capital requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate. bank subsidiaries. gs bank usa is our primary u.s. banking subsidiary and gsib and gsbe are our primary non-u.s. banking subsidiaries. these entities are subject to regulatory capital requirements. see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the regulatory capital requirements of our bank subsidiaries. u.s. regulated broker-dealer subsidiaries. gs&co., our primary u.s. regulated broker-dealer subsidiary, is also a registered futures commission merchant and a registered swap dealer with the cftc, and a registered security-based swap dealer with the sec, and therefore is subject to regulatory capital requirements imposed by the sec, the financial industry regulatory authority, inc., the cftc, the chicago mercantile exchange and the national futures association. rule 15c3-1 of the sec and rules 1.17 and part 23 subpart e of the cftc specify uniform minimum net capital requirements, as defined, for their registrants, and also effectively require that a significant part of the registrants' assets be kept in relatively liquid form. gs&co. has elected to calculate its minimum capital requirements in accordance with the \"alternative net capital requirement\" as permitted by rule 15c3-1 of the sec. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis gs&co. had regulatory net capital, as defined by rule 15c3-1, of $22.21 billion as of december 2022 and $22.18 billion as of december 2021, which exceeded the amount required by $17.46 billion as of december 2022 and $17.74 billion as of december 2021. in addition to its alternative minimum net capital requirements, gs&co. is also required to hold tentative net capital in excess of $5 billion and net capital in excess of $1 billion in accordance with rule 15c3-1. gs&co. is also required to notify the sec in the event that its tentative net capital is less than $6 billion. as of both december 2022 and december 2021, gs&co. had tentative net capital and net capital in excess of both the minimum and the notification requirements. non-u.s. regulated broker-dealer subsidiaries. our principal non-u.s. regulated broker-dealer subsidiaries include gsi and gsjcl. gsi, our u.k. broker-dealer, is regulated by the prudential regulation authority (pra) and the financial conduct authority (fca). gsi is subject to the u.k. capital framework, which is largely based on the basel committee on banking supervision's (basel committee) capital framework for strengthening international capital standards (basel iii). the table below presents gsi's risk-based capital requirements. as of december 2022 2021 risk-based capital requirements cet1 capital ratio

gsi's external auditors and approval by gsi's board of directors for inclusion in risk-based capital. these profits contributed approximately 9 basis points to the cet1 capital ratio as of december 2022. gsi is also subject to the minimum leverage ratio requirement of 3.25% established by the pra, which became effective in january 2023. gsi had a leverage ratio of 6.1% as of december 2022. the leverage ratio as of december 2022 reflected profits after foreseeable charges that are still subject to audit by gsi's external auditors and approval by gsi's board of directors for inclusion in risk-based capital. these profits contributed approximately 7 basis points to the leverage ratio as of december 2022. gsi is a registered swap dealer with the cftc and a registered security-based swap dealer with the sec. as of both december 2022 and december 2021, gsi was subject to and in compliance with applicable capital requirements for swap dealers and security-based swap dealers. gsi is also subject to a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities issued to affiliates. this requirement is subject to a transitional period which began to phase in from january 2019 and became fully effective beginning in january 2022. as of both december 2022 and december 2021, gsi was in compliance with this requirement. gsjcl, our japanese broker-dealer, is regulated by japan's financial services agency. gsjcl and certain other non-u.s. subsidiaries are also subject to capital requirements promulgated by authorities of the countries in which they operate. as of both december 2022 and december 2021, these subsidiaries were in compliance with their local capital requirements. regulatory and other matters regulatory matters our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and supervision worldwide. regulations have been adopted or are being considered by regulators and policy makers worldwide. given that many of the new and proposed rules are highly complex, the full impact of regulatory reform will not be known until the rules are implemented and market practices develop under the final regulations. see \"business - regulation\" in part i, item 1 of this form

inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis other matters replacement of interbank offered rates (ibors), including libor. on january 1, 2022, the publication of all eur, chf, jpy and gbp libor (non-usd libor) settings along with certain usd libor settings ceased. the publication of the most commonly used usd libor settings as representative rates will cease after june 2023. the fca has allowed the publication and use of synthetic rates for certain gbp libor settings in legacy gbp libor-based derivative contracts through march 2024. the fca has proposed to allow the publication and use of synthetic rates for certain usd libor settings in legacy usd libor-based derivative contracts through september 2024. the u.s. federal banking agencies' guidance strongly encourages banking organizations to cease using usd libor. the international swaps and derivatives association (isda) 2020 ibor fallbacks protocol (ibor protocol) has provided derivatives market participants with amended fallbacks for legacy and new derivative contracts to mitigate legal or economic uncertainty. both counterparties have to adhere to the ibor protocol or engage in bilateral amendments for the terms to be effective for derivative contracts. isda has confirmed that the fca's formal announcement to cease both non-usd and usd libor settings fixed the spread adjustment for all libor rates and as a result fallbacks applied automatically for non-usd libor settings following december 31, 2021 and will apply automatically for usd libor settings following june 30, 2023. the adjustable interest rate (libor) act, that was enacted in march 2022, provides a statutory framework to replace usd libor with a benchmark rate based on the secured overnight financing rate (sofr) for contracts governed by u.s. law that have no fallbacks or fallbacks that would require the use of a poll or libor-based rate. in december 2022, the frb adopted a final rule that implements the libor act, which will become effective on february 27, 2023. the final rule identifies different sofr-based replacement rates for derivative contracts, for cash instruments such as floating-rate notes and preferred stock, for consumer contracts, for certain government-sponsored enterprise contracts and for certain student loan securitizations that lack a fallback to an alternative rate when usd libor ceases to be published on june 30, 2023. we facilitated an orderly transition from non-usd libors to alternative risk-free reference rates and synthetic rates for us and our clients, and continue to make progress on our transition program as it relates to usd libor. our risk exposure to usd libor is primarily in connection with our derivative contracts and, to a lesser extent, our unsecured debt, preferred stock and loan portfolio. as of december 2022, the notional amount of our usd libor-based derivative contracts was approximately $6 trillion, of which approximately $5 trillion will mature after june 2023 based on their contractual terms. substantially all of such derivative contracts are with counterparties under bilateral agreements subject to the ibor protocol, or with central clearing counterparties or exchanges which have incorporated fallbacks consistent with the ibor protocol in their rulebooks and have announced that they plan to convert usd libor contracts to alternative risk-free reference rates. our unsecured benchmark debt and preferred stock with usd libor exposure was approximately $29.0 billion as of december 2022, of which $26.4 billion will contractually mature after june 2023 or is perpetual and has no stated maturity date. under the frb's final rule and the libor act, we will replace our usd libor-based unsecured benchmark debt and preferred stock with term sofr plus the statutorily prescribed tenor spread. this transition will take place following usd libor cessation on june 30, 2023. in addition, our usd libor-based loans were approximately $33.1 billion as of december 2022, of which approximately $30.5 billion will mature after june 2023 based on their contractual terms. a vast majority of such loans contain fallback provisions in the related loan agreements and we are actively engaging with our clients and syndicate partners to remediate the remaining loans agreements. we have also issued debt and deposits linked to sofr and sterling overnight index average (sonia) and executed sofr- and sonia-based derivative contracts to make markets and facilitate client activities. when appropriate, we continue to execute transactions in the market to reduce our usd libor exposures arising from hedges to our fixed-rate debt issuances and replace them with alternative risk-free reference rate exposures. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, we enter into various types of off-balance sheet arrangements. our involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including: •purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in special purpose entities, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization vehicles; •holding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and general partnerships, and preferred and common stock in other nonconsolidated vehicles; •entering into interest rate, foreign currency, equity, commodity and credit derivatives, including total return swaps; and •providing guarantees, indemnifications, commitments, letters of credit and representations and warranties. we enter into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes, including securitizations. the securitization vehicles that purchase mortgages, corporate bonds and other types of financial assets are critical to the functioning of several significant investor markets, including the mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities markets, since they offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process. we also enter into these arrangements to underwrite client securitization transactions; provide secondary market liquidity; make investments in performing and nonperforming debt, distressed loans, power-related assets, equity securities, real estate and other assets; and provide investors with credit-linked and asset-repackaged notes. the table below presents where information about our various off-balance sheet arrangements may be found in this form 10-k.

inherent in our businesses and include liquidity, market, credit, operational, model, legal, compliance, conduct, regulatory and reputational risks. for further information about our risk management processes, see \"overview and structure of risk management,\" and for information about our areas of risk, see \"liquidity risk management,\" \"market risk management,\" \"credit risk management,\" \"operational risk management,\" \"model risk management\" and \"other risk management,\" as well as \"risk factors\" in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k. overview and structure of risk management overview we believe that effective risk management is critical to our success. accordingly, we have established an enterprise risk management framework that employs a comprehensive, integrated approach to risk management, and is designed to enable comprehensive risk management processes through which we identify, assess, monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our activities. our risk management structure is built around three core components: governance, processes and people. governance. risk management governance starts with the board, which both directly and through its committees, including its risk committee, oversees our risk management policies and practices implemented through the enterprise risk management framework. the board is also responsible for the annual review and approval of our risk appetite statement. the risk appetite statement describes the levels and types of risk we are willing to accept or to avoid, in order to achieve our objectives included in our strategic business plan, while remaining in compliance with regulatory requirements. the board reviews our strategic business plan and is ultimately responsible for overseeing and providing direction about our strategy and risk appetite. the board receives regular briefings on firmwide risks, including liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk, operational risk, model risk and climate risk, from our independent risk oversight and control functions, including the chief risk officer, and on compliance risk and conduct risk from compliance, on legal and regulatory enforcement matters from the chief legal officer, and on other matters impacting our reputation from the chair and vice-chairs of our firmwide reputational risk committee. the chief risk officer reports to our chief executive officer and to the risk committee of the board. as part of the review of the firmwide risk portfolio, the chief risk officer regularly advises the risk committee of the board of relevant risk metrics and material exposures, including risk limits and thresholds established in our risk appetite statement. the implementation of our risk governance structure and core risk management processes is overseen by enterprise risk, which reports to our chief risk officer, and is responsible for ensuring that our enterprise risk management framework provides the board, our risk committees and senior management with a consistent and integrated approach to managing our various risks in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. our revenue-producing units, as well as treasury, engineering, human capital management, operations, and corporate and workplace solutions, are considered our first line of defense. they are accountable for the outcomes of our risk-generating activities, as well as for assessing and managing those risks within our risk appetite. our independent risk oversight and control functions are considered our second line of defense and provide independent assessment, oversight and challenge of the risks taken by our first line of defense, as well as lead and participate in risk committees. independent risk oversight and control functions include compliance, conflicts resolution, controllers, legal, risk and tax. internal audit is considered our third line of defense, and our director of internal audit reports to the audit committee of the board and administratively to our chief executive officer. internal audit includes professionals with a broad range of audit and industry experience, including risk management expertise. internal audit is responsible for independently assessing and validating the effectiveness of key controls, including those within the risk management framework, and providing timely reporting to the audit committee of the board, senior management and regulators. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis the three lines of defense structure promotes the accountability of first line risk takers, provides a framework for effective challenge by the second line and empowers independent review from the third line. processes. we maintain various processes that are critical components of our risk management framework, including (i) risk identification and control assessment, (ii) risk appetite, limit and threshold setting, (iii) risk metrics, reporting and monitoring, and (iv) risk decision-making. •risk identification and control assessment. we believe the identification of our risks and related control assessment is a critical step in providing our board and senior management transparency and insight into the range and materiality of our risks. we have a comprehensive data collection process, including firmwide policies and procedures that require all employees to report and escalate risk events. our approach for risk identification and control assessment is comprehensive across all risk types, is dynamic and forward-looking to reflect and adapt to our changing risk profile and business environment, leverages subject matter expertise, and allows for prioritization of our most critical risks. this approach also encompasses our control assessment, led by our second line of defense, to review and challenge the control environment to ensure it supports our strategic business plan. to effectively assess our risks, we maintain a daily discipline of marking substantially all of our inventory to current market levels. we carry our inventory at fair value, with changes in valuation reflected immediately in our risk management systems and in net revenues. we do so because we believe this discipline is one of the most effective tools for assessing and managing risk and that it provides transparent and realistic insight into our inventory exposures. an important part of our risk management process is firmwide stress testing. it allows us to quantify our exposure to tail risks, highlight potential loss concentrations, undertake risk/reward analysis, and assess and mitigate our risk positions. firmwide stress tests are performed on a regular basis and are designed to ensure a comprehensive analysis of our vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks combining financial and nonfinancial risks, including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity and funding, operational and compliance, strategic, systemic and emerging risks into a single combined scenario. we also perform ad hoc stress tests in anticipation of market events or conditions. stress tests are also used to assess capital adequacy as part of our capital planning and stress testing process. see \"capital management and regulatory capital - capital management\" for further information. •risk appetite, limit and threshold setting. we apply a rigorous framework of limits and thresholds to control and monitor risk across transactions, products, businesses and markets. the board, directly or indirectly through its risk committee, approves limits and thresholds included in our risk appetite statement at firmwide, business and product levels. in addition, the firmwide risk appetite committee, through delegated authority from the firmwide enterprise risk committee, is responsible for approving our risk limits and thresholds policy, subject to the overall limits approved by the risk committee of the board, and monitoring these limits. the firmwide risk appetite committee is responsible for approving limits at firmwide, business and product levels. certain limits may be set at levels that will require periodic adjustment, rather than at levels that reflect our maximum risk appetite. this fosters an ongoing dialogue about risk among our first and second lines of defense, committees and senior management, as well as rapid escalation of risk-related matters. additionally, through delegated authority from the firmwide risk appetite committee, market risk sets limits at certain product and desk levels, and credit risk sets limits for individual counterparties and their subsidiaries, industries and countries. limits are reviewed regularly and amended on a permanent or temporary basis to reflect changing market conditions, business conditions or risk tolerance. •risk metrics, reporting and monitoring. effective risk reporting and risk decision-making depends on our ability to get the right information to the right people at the right time. as such, we focus on the rigor and effectiveness of our risk systems, with the objective of ensuring that our risk management technology systems provide us with complete, accurate and timely information. our risk metrics, reporting and monitoring processes are designed to take into account information about both existing and emerging risks, thereby enabling our risk committees and senior management to perform their responsibilities with the appropriate level of insight into risk exposures. furthermore, our limit and threshold breach processes provide means for timely escalation. we evaluate changes in our risk profile and our businesses, including changes in business mix or jurisdictions in which we operate, by monitoring risk factors at a firmwide level. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis •risk decision-making. our governance structure provides the protocol and responsibility for decision-making on risk management issues and ensures implementation of those decisions. we make extensive use of risk committees that meet regularly and serve as an important means to facilitate and foster ongoing discussions to manage and mitigate risks. we maintain strong and proactive communication about risk and we have a culture of collaboration in decision-making among our first and second lines of defense, committees and senior management. while our first line of defense is responsible for management of their risk, we dedicate extensive resources to our second line of defense in order to ensure a strong oversight structure and an appropriate segregation of duties. we regularly reinforce our strong culture of escalation and accountability across all functions. people. even the best technology serves only as a tool for helping to make informed decisions in real time about the risks we are taking. ultimately, effective risk management requires our people to interpret our risk data on an ongoing and timely basis and adjust risk positions accordingly. the experience of our professionals, and their understanding of the nuances and limitations of each risk measure, guides us in assessing exposures and maintaining them within prudent levels. we reinforce a culture of effective risk management, consistent with our risk appetite, in our training and development programs, as well as in the way we evaluate performance, and recognize and reward our people. our training and development programs, including certain sessions led by our most senior leaders, are focused on the importance of risk management, client relationships and reputational excellence. as part of our performance review process, we assess reputational excellence, including how an employee exercises good risk management and reputational judgment, and adheres to our code of conduct and compliance policies. our review and reward processes are designed to communicate and reinforce to our professionals the link between behavior and how people are recognized, the need to focus on our clients and our reputation, and the need to always act in accordance with our highest standards. structure ultimate oversight of risk is the responsibility of our board. the board oversees risk both directly and through its committees, including its risk committee. we also have a series of committees with specific risk management mandates that have oversight or decision-making responsibilities for risk management activities. committee membership generally consists of senior managers from both our first and second lines of defense. we have established procedures for these committees to ensure that appropriate information barriers are in place. our primary risk committees, most of which also have additional sub-committees, councils or working groups, are described below. in addition to these committees, we have other risk committees that provide oversight for different businesses, activities, products, regions and entities. all of our committees have responsibility for considering the impact on our reputation of the transactions and activities that they oversee. membership of our risk committees is reviewed regularly and updated to reflect changes in the responsibilities of the committee members. accordingly, the length of time that members serve on the respective committees varies as determined by the committee chairs and based on the responsibilities of the members. the chart below presents an overview of our risk management governance structure. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis management committee. the management committee oversees our global activities. it provides this oversight directly and through authority delegated to committees it has established. this committee consists of our most senior leaders, and is chaired by our chief executive officer. most members of the management committee are also members of other committees. the following are the committees that are principally involved in firmwide risk management. firmwide enterprise risk committee. the firmwide enterprise risk committee is responsible for overseeing all of our financial and nonfinancial risks. as part of such oversight, the committee is responsible for the ongoing review, approval and monitoring of our enterprise risk management framework, as well as our risk limits and thresholds policy, through delegated authority to the firmwide risk appetite committee. this committee also reviews new significant strategic business initiatives to determine whether they are consistent with our risk appetite and risk management capabilities. additionally, the firmwide enterprise risk committee performs enhanced reviews of significant risk events, the top residual and emerging risks, and the overall risk and control environment in each of our business units in order to propose uplifts, identify elements that are common to all business units and analyze the consolidated residual risks that we face. this committee, which reports to the management committee, is co-chaired by our president and chief operating officer and our chief risk officer, who are appointed as chairs by our chief executive officer, and the vice-chair is our chief financial officer, who is appointed as vice-chair by the chairs of the firmwide enterprise risk committee. the following are the primary committees or councils that report to

report into the firmwide operational risk and resilience committee. this committee is co-chaired by our chief administrative officer for emea and our head of operational risk, who are appointed as chairs by the chairs of the firmwide enterprise risk committee. •firmwide conduct committee. the firmwide conduct committee is responsible for the ongoing approval and monitoring of the frameworks and policies which govern our conduct risks. conduct risk is the risk that our people fail to act in a manner consistent with our business principles and related core values, policies or codes, or applicable laws or regulations, thereby falling short in fulfilling their responsibilities to us, our clients, colleagues, other market participants or the broader community. this committee is chaired by our chief legal officer, who is appointed as chair by the chairs of the firmwide enterprise risk committee. •firmwide risk appetite committee. the firmwide risk appetite committee (through delegated authority from the firmwide enterprise risk committee) is responsible for the ongoing approval and monitoring of risk frameworks, policies and parameters related to our core risk management processes, as well as limits and thresholds, at firmwide, business and product levels. in addition, this committee is responsible for overseeing our financial risks and reviews the results of stress tests and scenario analyses. to assist the firmwide risk appetite committee in carrying out its mandate, a number of other risk committees with dedicated oversight for stress testing, model risks, volcker rule compliance, as well as our investments or other capital commitments that may give rise to financial risk, report into the firmwide risk appetite committee. this committee is chaired by our chief risk officer, who is appointed as chair by the chairs of the firmwide enterprise risk committee. the firmwide capital committee and firmwide commitments committee report to the firmwide risk appetite committee. firmwide capital committee. the firmwide capital committee provides approval and oversight of debt-related transactions, including principal commitments of our capital. this committee aims to ensure that business, reputational and suitability standards for underwritings and capital commitments are maintained on a global basis. this committee is co-chaired by our head of credit risk and a co-head of our global financing group, who are appointed as chairs by the chair of the firmwide risk appetite committee. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis firmwide commitments committee. the firmwide commitments committee reviews our underwriting and distribution activities with respect to equity and equity-related product offerings, and sets and maintains policies and procedures designed to ensure that legal, reputational, regulatory and business standards are maintained on a global basis. in addition to reviewing specific transactions, this committee periodically conducts general strategic reviews of sectors and products and establishes policies in connection with transaction practices. this committee is co-chaired by our chief equity underwriting officer for the americas, a co-chairman of our global financial institutions group and a co-head of our global investment grade capital markets and risk management group in global banking & markets, who are appointed as chairs by the chair of the firmwide risk appetite committee. •firmwide reputational risk committee. the firmwide reputational risk committee is responsible for assessing reputational risks arising from transactions that have been identified as having potential heightened reputational risk pursuant to the criteria established by the firmwide reputational risk committee and as determined by committee leadership. this committee is also responsible for overseeing client-related business standards and addressing client-related reputational risk. this committee is chaired by our president and chief operating officer, who is appointed as chair by our chief executive officer, and the vice-chairs are our chief legal officer and the head of conflicts resolution, who are appointed as vice-chairs by the chair of the firmwide reputational risk committee. this committee periodically provides updates to, and receives guidance from, the public responsibilities committee of the board. the firmwide suitability committee reports to the firmwide reputational risk committee. firmwide suitability committee. the firmwide suitability committee is responsible for setting standards and policies for product, transaction and client suitability and providing a forum for consistency across functions, regions and products on suitability assessments. this committee also reviews suitability matters escalated from other committees. this committee is co-chaired by our chief compliance officer, and the head of net zero transition solutions in global banking & markets, who are appointed as chairs by the chair of the firmwide reputational risk committee. firmwide asset liability committee. the firmwide asset liability committee reviews and approves the strategic direction for our financial resources, including capital, liquidity, funding and balance sheet. this committee has oversight responsibility for asset liability management, including interest rate and currency risk, funds transfer pricing, capital allocation and incentives, and credit ratings. this committee makes recommendations as to any adjustments to asset liability management and financial resource allocation in light of current events, risks, exposures, and regulatory requirements and approves related policies. this committee is co-chaired by our chief financial officer and our global treasurer, who are appointed as chairs by our chief executive officer, and reports to the management committee. liquidity risk management overview liquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to fund ourselves or meet our liquidity needs in the event of firm-specific, broader industry or market liquidity stress events. we have in place a comprehensive and conservative set of liquidity and funding policies. our principal objective is to be able to fund ourselves and to enable our core businesses to continue to serve clients and generate revenues, even under adverse circumstances. treasury, which reports to our chief financial officer, has primary responsibility for developing, managing and executing our liquidity and funding strategy within our risk appetite. liquidity risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and treasury, and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for identifying, monitoring and managing our liquidity risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses and the establishment of stress testing and limits frameworks. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis liquidity risk management principles we manage liquidity risk according to three principles: (i) hold sufficient excess liquidity in the form of gcla to cover outflows during a stressed period, (ii) maintain appropriate asset-liability management and (iii) maintain a viable contingency funding plan. gcla. gcla is liquidity that we maintain to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in a stressed environment. a primary liquidity principle is to pre-fund our estimated potential cash and collateral needs during a liquidity crisis and hold this liquidity in the form of unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash. we believe that the securities held in our gcla would be readily convertible to cash in a matter of days, through liquidation, by entering into repurchase agreements or from maturities of resale agreements, and that this cash would allow us to meet immediate obligations without needing to sell other assets or depend on additional funding from credit-sensitive markets. our gcla reflects the following principles: •the first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most critical to a company's survival; •focus must be maintained on all potential cash and collateral outflows, not just disruptions to financing flows. our businesses are diverse, and our liquidity needs are determined by many factors, including market movements, collateral requirements and client commitments, all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment; •during a liquidity crisis, credit-sensitive funding, including unsecured debt, certain deposits and some types of secured financing agreements, may be unavailable, and the terms (e.g., interest rates, collateral provisions and tenor) or availability of other types of secured financing may change and certain deposits may be withdrawn; and •as a result of our policy to pre-fund liquidity that we estimate may be needed in a crisis, we hold more unencumbered securities and have larger funding balances than our businesses would otherwise require. we believe that our liquidity is stronger with greater balances of highly liquid unencumbered securities, even though it increases our total assets and our funding costs. we maintain our gcla across group inc., goldman sachs funding llc (funding ihc) and group inc.'s major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries, asset types and clearing agents to provide us with sufficient operating liquidity to ensure timely settlement in all major markets, even in a difficult funding environment. in addition to the gcla, we maintain cash balances and securities in several of our other entities, primarily for use in specific currencies, entities or jurisdictions where we do not have immediate access to parent company liquidity. asset-liability management. our liquidity risk management policies are designed to ensure we have a sufficient amount of financing, even when funding markets experience persistent stress. we manage the maturities and diversity of our funding across markets, products and counterparties, and seek to maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets. our approach to asset-liability management includes: •conservatively managing the overall characteristics of our funding book, with a focus on maintaining long-term, diversified sources of funding in excess of our current requirements. see \"balance sheet and funding sources - funding sources\" for further information; •actively managing and monitoring our asset base, with particular focus on the liquidity, holding period and ability to fund assets on a secured basis. we assess our funding requirements and our ability to liquidate assets in a stressed environment while appropriately managing risk. this enables us to determine the most appropriate funding products and tenors. see \"balance sheet and funding sources - balance sheet management\" for further information about our balance sheet management process and \"- funding sources - secured funding\" for further information about asset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis; and •raising secured and unsecured financing that has a long tenor relative to the liquidity profile of our assets. this reduces the risk that our liabilities will come due in advance of our ability to generate liquidity from the sale of our assets. because we maintain a highly liquid balance sheet, the holding period of certain of our assets may be materially shorter than their contractual maturity dates. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis our goal is to ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our assets and meet our contractual and contingent obligations in normal times, as well as during periods of market stress. through our dynamic balance sheet management process, we use actual and projected asset balances to determine secured and unsecured funding requirements. funding plans are reviewed and approved by the firmwide asset liability committee. in addition, our independent risk oversight and control functions analyze, and the firmwide asset liability committee reviews, our consolidated total capital position (unsecured long-term borrowings plus total shareholders' equity) so that we maintain a level of long-term funding that is sufficient to meet our long-term financing requirements. in a liquidity crisis, we would first use our gcla in order to avoid reliance on asset sales (other than our gcla). however, we recognize that orderly asset sales may be prudent or necessary in a severe or persistent liquidity crisis. subsidiary funding policies the majority of our unsecured funding is raised by group inc., which provides the necessary funds to funding ihc and other subsidiaries, some of which are regulated, to meet their asset financing, liquidity and capital requirements. in addition, group inc. provides its regulated subsidiaries with the necessary capital to meet their regulatory requirements. the benefits of this approach to subsidiary funding are enhanced control and greater flexibility to meet the funding requirements of our subsidiaries. funding is also raised at the subsidiary level through a variety of products, including deposits, secured funding and unsecured borrowings. our intercompany funding policies assume that a subsidiary's funds or securities are not freely available to its parent, funding ihc or other subsidiaries unless (i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. in particular, many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to group inc. or funding ihc. regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that group inc. needs to make payments on its obligations. accordingly, we assume that the capital provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to group inc. or other subsidiaries and any other financing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to group inc. or funding ihc until the maturity of such financing. group inc. has provided substantial amounts of equity and subordinated indebtedness, directly or indirectly, to its regulated subsidiaries. for example, as of december 2022, group inc. had $39.33 billion of equity and subordinated indebtedness invested in gs&co., its principal u.s. registered broker-dealer; $47.74 billion invested in gsi, a regulated u.k. broker-dealer; $2.62 billion invested in gsjcl, a regulated japanese broker-dealer; $52.55 billion invested in gs bank usa, a regulated new york state-chartered bank; and $4.25 billion invested in gsib, a regulated u.k. bank. group inc. also provides financing, directly or indirectly, in the form of: $108.14 billion of unsubordinated loans (including secured loans of $52.93 billion) and $30.16 billion of collateral and cash deposits to these entities as of december 2022. in addition, as of december 2022, group inc. had significant amounts of capital invested in and loans to its other regulated subsidiaries. contingency funding plan. we maintain a contingency funding plan to provide a framework for analyzing and responding to a liquidity crisis situation or periods of market stress. our contingency funding plan outlines a list of potential risk factors, key reports and metrics that are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assist in assessing the severity of, and managing through, a liquidity crisis and/or market dislocation. the contingency funding plan also describes in detail our potential responses if our assessments indicate that we have entered a liquidity crisis, which include pre-funding for what we estimate will be our potential cash and collateral needs, as well as utilizing secondary sources of liquidity. mitigants and action items to address specific risks which may arise are also described and assigned to individuals responsible for execution. the contingency funding plan identifies key groups of individuals and their responsibilities, which include fostering effective coordination, control and distribution of information, implementing liquidity maintenance activities and managing internal and external communication, all of which are critical in the management of a crisis or period of market stress. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis stress tests in order to determine the appropriate size of our gcla, we model liquidity outflows over a range of scenarios and time horizons. one of our primary internal liquidity risk models, referred to as the modeled liquidity outflow, quantifies our liquidity risks over a 30-day stress scenario. we also consider other factors, including, but not limited to, an assessment of our potential intraday liquidity needs through an additional internal liquidity risk model, referred to as the intraday liquidity model, the results of our long-term stress testing models, our resolution liquidity models and other applicable regulatory requirements and a qualitative assessment of our condition, as well as the financial markets. the results of the modeled liquidity outflow, the intraday liquidity model, the long-term stress testing models and the resolution liquidity models are reported to senior management on a regular basis. we also perform firmwide stress tests. see \"overview and structure of risk management\" for information about firmwide stress tests. modeled liquidity outflow. our modeled liquidity outflow is based on conducting multiple scenarios that include combinations of market-wide and firm-specific stress. these scenarios are characterized by the following qualitative elements: •severely challenged market environments, which include low consumer and corporate confidence, financial and political instability, and adverse changes in market values, including potential declines in equity markets and widening of credit spreads; and •a firm-specific crisis potentially triggered by material losses, reputational damage, litigation and/or a ratings downgrade. the following are key modeling elements of our modeled liquidity outflow: •liquidity needs over a 30-day scenario; •a two-notch downgrade of our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings; •changing conditions in funding markets, which limit our access to unsecured and secured funding; •no support from additional government funding facilities. although we have access to various central bank funding programs, we do not assume reliance on additional sources of funding in a liquidity crisis; and •a combination of contractual outflows and contingent outflows arising from both our on- and off-balance sheet arrangements. contractual outflows include, among other things, upcoming maturities of unsecured debt, term deposits and secured funding. contingent outflows include, among other things, the withdrawal of customer credit balances in our prime brokerage business, increase in variation margin requirements due to adverse changes in the value of our exchange-traded and otc-cleared derivatives, draws on unfunded commitments and withdrawals of deposits that have no contractual maturity. see notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about contractual outflows, including note 11 for collateralized financings, note 13 for deposits, note 14 for unsecured long-term borrowings and note 15 for operating lease payments, and \"off-balance sheet arrangements\" for further information about our various types of off-balance sheet arrangements. intraday liquidity model. our intraday liquidity model measures our intraday liquidity needs using a scenario analysis characterized by the same qualitative elements as our modeled liquidity outflow. the model assesses the risk of increased intraday liquidity requirements during a scenario where access to sources of intraday liquidity may become constrained. long-term stress testing. we utilize longer-term stress tests to take a forward view on our liquidity position through prolonged stress periods in which we experience a severe liquidity stress and recover in an environment that continues to be challenging. we are focused on ensuring conservative asset-liability management to prepare for a prolonged period of potential stress, seeking to maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets. resolution liquidity models. in connection with our resolution planning efforts, we have established our resolution liquidity adequacy and positioning framework, which estimates liquidity needs of our major subsidiaries in a stressed environment. the liquidity needs are measured using our modeled liquidity outflow assumptions and include certain additional inter-affiliate exposures. we have also established our resolution liquidity execution need framework, which measures the liquidity needs of our major subsidiaries to stabilize and wind down following a group inc. bankruptcy filing in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy. in addition, we have established a triggers and alerts framework, which is designed to provide the board with information needed to make an informed decision on whether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings for group inc. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis limits we use liquidity risk limits at various levels and across liquidity risk types to manage the size of our liquidity exposures. limits are measured relative to acceptable levels of risk given our liquidity risk tolerance. see \"overview and structure of risk management\" for information about the limit approval process. limits are monitored by treasury and liquidity risk. liquidity risk is responsible for identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded. gcla and unencumbered metrics gcla. based on the results of our internal liquidity risk models, described above, as well as our consideration of other factors, including, but not limited to, a qualitative assessment of our condition, as well as the financial markets, we believe our liquidity position as of both december 2022 and december 2021 was appropriate. we strictly limit our gcla to a narrowly defined list of securities and cash because they are highly liquid, even in a difficult funding environment. we do not include other potential sources of excess liquidity in our gcla, such as less liquid unencumbered securities or committed credit facilities. the table below presents information about our gcla.

liquidity requirements of our parent company, group inc., and its subsidiaries. our modeled liquidity outflow and intraday liquidity model incorporate a requirement for group inc., as well as a standalone requirement for each of our major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries. funding ihc is required to provide the necessary liquidity to group inc. during the ordinary course of business, and is also obligated to provide capital and liquidity support to major subsidiaries in the event of our material financial distress or failure. liquidity held directly in each of our major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries is intended for use only by that subsidiary to meet its liquidity requirements and is assumed not to be available to group inc. or funding ihc unless (i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. in addition, the modeled liquidity outflow and intraday liquidity model also incorporate a broader assessment of standalone liquidity requirements for other subsidiaries and we hold a portion of our gcla directly at group inc. or funding ihc to support such requirements. other unencumbered assets. in addition to our gcla, we have a significant amount of other unencumbered cash and financial instruments, including other government obligations, high-grade money market securities, corporate obligations, marginable

and monitoring, as well as other regulatory developments. the implementation of these rules and any amendments adopted by the regulatory authorities could impact our liquidity and funding requirements and practices in the future. credit ratings we rely on the short- and long-term debt capital markets to fund a significant portion of our day-to-day operations and the cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings. credit ratings are also important when we are competing in certain markets, such as otc derivatives, and when we seek to engage in longer-term

liquidity, market, credit and operational risk management practices; •our level and variability of earnings; •our capital base; •our franchise, reputation and management; •our corporate governance; and •the external operating and economic environment, including, in some cases, the assumed level of government support or other systemic considerations, such as potential resolution. certain of our derivatives have been transacted under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings. we manage our gcla to ensure we would, among other potential requirements, be able to make the additional collateral or termination payments that may be required in the event of a two-notch reduction in our long-term credit ratings, as well as collateral that has not been called by counterparties, but is available to them. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about derivatives with credit-related contingent features and the additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a one- or two-notch downgrade in our credit ratings. cash flows as a global financial institution, our cash flows are complex and bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets. consequently, we believe that traditional cash flow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating our liquidity position than the liquidity and asset-liability management policies described above. cash flow analysis may, however, be helpful in highlighting certain macro trends and strategic initiatives in our businesses. year ended december 2022. our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $19.21 billion to $241.83 billion at the end of 2022, primarily due to net cash used for investing activities, partially offset by net cash provided by financing activities. the net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected purchases of investments (primarily u.s. government obligations accounted for as held-to-maturity) and an increase in net lending activities (reflecting increases in other collateralized and consumer loans). the net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected cash inflows from net issuances of unsecured long-term borrowings and deposits (reflecting increases in transaction banking and private bank and consumer deposits, partially offset by a decrease in other deposits). the net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflected cash inflows from trading assets and liabilities, customer and other receivables and payables, net (reflecting both a decrease in customer and other receivables and an increase in customer and other payables), net earnings and loans held for sale, net, partially offset by cash outflows from collateralized transactions (reflecting both a decrease in collateralized financings and an increase in collateralized agreements). the decrease in cash and cash equivalents as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates was due to the u.s. dollar strengthening during the year. such amount was $11.56 billion for 2022 ($3.42 billion for the three months ended march 2022, $10.34 billion for the six months ended june 2022 and $18.17 billion for the nine months ended september 2022). year ended december 2021. our cash and cash equivalents increased by $105.19 billion to $261.04 billion at the end of 2021, primarily due to net cash provided by financing activities, partially offset by net cash used for investing activities. the net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected an increase in net deposits (reflecting increases across channels) and net issuances of unsecured long-term borrowings. the net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected purchases of investments and an increase in net lending activities, partially offset by sales and paydowns of investments. for an analysis of cash flows for the year ended december 2020, see part ii, item 7 \"management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of

market risk management overview market risk is the risk of an adverse impact to our earnings due to changes in market conditions. our assets and liabilities that give rise to market risk primarily include positions held for market making for our clients and for our investing and financing activities, and these positions change based on client demands and our investment opportunities. we employ a variety of risk measures, each described in the respective sections below, to monitor market risk. categories of market risk include the following: •interest rate risk: results from exposures to changes in the level, slope and curvature of yield curves, the volatilities of interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit spreads; •equity price risk: results from exposures to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities, baskets of equities and equity indices; •currency rate risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of currency rates; and •commodity price risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of commodities, such as crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, electricity, and precious and base metals. market risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our market risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses. managers in revenue-producing units, treasury and market risk discuss market information, positions and estimated loss scenarios on an ongoing basis. managers in revenue-producing units and treasury are accountable for managing risk within prescribed limits. these managers have in-depth knowledge of their positions, markets and the instruments available to hedge their exposures. market risk management process our process for managing market risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the \"overview and structure of risk management,\" as well as the following: •monitoring compliance with established market risk limits and reporting our exposures; •diversifying exposures; •controlling position sizes; and •evaluating mitigants, such as economic hedges in related securities or derivatives. our market risk management systems enable us to perform an independent calculation of value-at-risk (var), earnings-at-risk (ear) and other stress measures, capture risk measures at individual position levels, attribute risk measures to individual risk factors of each position, report many different views of the risk measures (e.g., by desk, business, product type or entity) and produce ad hoc analyses in a timely manner. risk measures we produce risk measures and monitor them against established market risk limits. these measures reflect an extensive range of scenarios and the results are aggregated at product, business and firmwide levels. we use a variety of risk measures to estimate the size of potential losses for both moderate and more extreme market moves over both short- and long-term time horizons. our primary risk measures are var, ear and other stress tests. our risk reports detail key risks, drivers and changes for each desk and business, and are distributed daily to senior management of both our revenue-producing units and our independent risk oversight and control functions. value-at-risk. var is the potential loss in value due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level. for assets and liabilities included in var, see \"financial statement linkages to market risk measures.\" we typically employ a one-day time horizon with a 95% confidence level. we use a single var model, which captures risks, including interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. as such, var facilitates comparison across portfolios of different risk characteristics. var also captures the diversification of aggregated risk at the firmwide level. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis we are aware of the inherent limitations to var and therefore use a variety of risk measures in our market risk management process. inherent limitations to var include: •var does not estimate potential losses over longer time horizons where moves may be extreme; •var does not take account of the relative liquidity of different risk positions; and •previous moves in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of all future market moves. to comprehensively capture our exposures and relevant risks in our var calculation, we use historical simulations with full valuation of market factors at the position level by simultaneously shocking the relevant market factors for that position. these market factors include spot prices, credit spreads, funding spreads, yield curves, volatility and correlation, and are updated periodically based on changes in the composition of positions, as well as variations in market conditions. we sample from five years of historical data to generate the scenarios for our var calculation. the historical data is weighted so that the relative importance of the data reduces over time. this gives greater importance to more recent observations and reflects current asset volatilities, which improves the accuracy of our estimates of potential loss. as a result, even if our positions included in var were unchanged, our var would increase with increasing market volatility and vice versa. given its reliance on historical data, var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. our var measure does not include: •positions that are not accounted for at fair value, such as held-to-maturity securities and loans, deposits and unsecured borrowings that are accounted for at amortized cost; •available-for-sale securities for which the related unrealized fair value gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss); •positions that are best measured and monitored using sensitivity measures; and •the impact of changes in counterparty and our own credit spreads on derivatives, as well as changes in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected. we perform daily backtesting of our var model (i.e., comparing daily net revenues for positions included in var to the var measure calculated as of the prior business day) at the firmwide level and for each of our businesses and major regulated subsidiaries. earnings-at-risk. beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022, we started managing our interest rate risk using the ear metric. ear measures the estimated impact of changes in interest rates to our net revenues and preferred stock dividends over a defined time horizon. ear complements the var metric, which measures the impact of interest rate changes that have an immediate impact on the fair values of our assets and liabilities (i.e., mark-to-market changes). our exposure to interest rate risk occurs due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: •differences in maturity or repricing dates of assets, liabilities, preferred stock and certain off-balance sheet instruments. •differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities, preferred stock and certain off-balance sheet instruments with the same maturity or repricing dates. •certain interest rate sensitive fees. treasury manages the aggregated interest rate risk from all businesses through our investment securities portfolio and interest rate derivatives. we measure ear over a one-year time horizon following a 100-basis point instantaneous parallel shock in both short- and long-term interest rates. this sensitivity is calculated relative to a baseline market scenario, which takes into consideration, among other things, the market's expectation of forward rates, as well as our expectation of future business activity. this scenario includes contractual elements of assets, liabilities, preferred stock, and certain off-balance sheet instruments, such as rates of interest, principal repayment schedules, maturity and reset dates, and any interest rate ceilings or floors, as well as assumptions with respect to our balance sheet size and composition, deposit repricing and prepayment behavior. we manage ear with a goal to reduce potential volatility resulting from changes in interest rates so it remains within our ear risk appetite. our ear scenario is regularly evaluated and updated, if necessary, to reflect changes in our business plans, market conditions and other macroeconomic factors. while management uses the best information available to estimate ear, actual results may differ materially as a result of, among other things, changes in the economic environment or assumptions used in the process. risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units, and treasury, have primary responsibility for assessing and monitoring ear through firmwide oversight, including oversight of ear stress testing and assumptions, and the establishment of our ear risk appetite. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis stress testing. stress testing is a method of determining the effect of various hypothetical stress scenarios. in addition to ear, we use other stress tests to examine risks of specific portfolios, as well as the potential impact of our significant risk exposures. we use a variety of stress testing techniques to calculate the potential loss from a wide range of market moves on our portfolios, including firmwide stress tests, sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis. the results of our various stress tests are analyzed together for risk management purposes. see \"overview and structure of risk management\" for information about firmwide stress tests. sensitivity analysis is used to quantify the impact of a market move in a single risk factor across all positions (e.g., equity prices or credit spreads) using a variety of defined market shocks, ranging from those that could be expected over a one-day time horizon up to those that could take many months to occur. we also use sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of the default of any single entity, which captures the risk of large or concentrated exposures. scenario analysis is used to quantify the impact of a specified event, including how the event impacts multiple risk factors simultaneously. for example, for sovereign stress testing we calculate potential direct exposure associated with our sovereign positions, as well as the corresponding debt, equity and currency exposures associated with our non-sovereign positions that may be impacted by the sovereign distress. when conducting scenario analysis, we often consider a number of possible outcomes for each scenario, ranging from moderate to severely adverse market impacts. in addition, these stress tests are constructed using both historical events and forward-looking hypothetical scenarios. unlike var measures, which have an implied probability because they are calculated at a specified confidence level, there may not be an implied probability that our stress testing scenarios will occur. instead, stress testing is used to model both moderate and more extreme moves in underlying market factors. when estimating potential loss, we generally assume that our positions cannot be reduced or hedged (although experience demonstrates that we are generally able to do so). limits we use market risk limits at various levels to manage the size of our market exposures. these limits are set based on var, ear and on a range of stress tests relevant to our exposures. see \"overview and structure of risk management\" for information about the limit approval process. limits are monitored by treasury and risk. risk is responsible for identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded (e.g., due to positional changes or changes in market conditions, such as increased volatilities or changes in correlations). such instances are remediated by a reduction in the positions we hold and/or a temporary or permanent increase to the limit, if warranted. metrics we analyze var at the firmwide level and a variety of more detailed levels, including by risk category, business and region. diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total var and the sum of the vars for the four risk categories. this effect arises because the four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated. the table below presents our average daily var. year ended december $ in millions

million in 2022 from $86 million in 2021, due to higher levels of volatility, partially offset by reduced exposures. the total increase was driven by increases in the interest rates, commodity prices

in the interest rates and currency rates categories, partially offset by an increase in the diversification effect and a decrease in the commodity prices category. during 2022, the firmwide var risk limit was exceeded on six occasions (all of which occurred during march 2022) primarily due to higher levels of volatility generally resulting from broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns. these limit breaches were resolved by temporary increases in the firmwide var risk limit and subsequent risk reductions. during this period, the firmwide var risk limit was also permanently increased due to higher levels of volatility. during 2021, the firmwide var risk limit was not exceeded and there were no permanent or temporary changes to the firmwide var risk limit. the goldman sachs group, inc.

one occasion during 2021. during periods in which we have significantly more positive net revenue days than net revenue loss days, we expect to have fewer var exceptions because, under normal conditions, our business model generally produces positive net revenues. in periods in which our franchise revenues are adversely affected, we generally have more loss days, resulting in more var exceptions. the daily net revenues for positions included in var used to determine var exceptions reflect the impact of any intraday activity, including bid/offer net revenues, which are more likely

credit risk represents the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty (e.g., an otc derivatives counterparty or a borrower) or an issuer of securities or other instruments we hold. our exposure to credit risk comes mostly from client transactions in otc derivatives and loans and lending commitments. credit risk also comes from cash placed with banks, securities financing transactions (i.e., resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending activities) and customer and other receivables. credit risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our credit risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses. in addition, we hold other positions that give rise to credit risk (e.g., bonds and secondary bank loans). these credit risks are captured as a component of market risk measures, which are monitored and managed by market risk. we also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures. such derivatives also give rise to credit risk, which is monitored and managed by credit risk. credit risk management process our process for managing credit risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the \"overview and structure of risk management,\" as well as the following: •monitoring compliance with established credit risk limits and reporting our credit exposures and credit concentrations; •establishing or approving underwriting standards; •assessing the likelihood that a counterparty will default on its payment obligations; •measuring our current and potential credit exposure and losses resulting from a counterparty default; •using credit risk mitigants, including collateral and hedging; and •maximizing recovery through active workout and restructuring of claims. we also perform credit analyses, which incorporate initial and ongoing evaluations of the capacity and willingness of a counterparty to meet its financial obligations. for substantially all of our credit exposures, the core of our process is an annual counterparty credit evaluation or more frequently if deemed necessary as a result of events or changes in circumstances. we determine an internal credit rating for the counterparty by considering the results of the credit evaluations and assumptions with respect to the nature of and outlook for the counterparty's industry and the economic environment. the internal credit rating does not take into consideration collateral received or other credit support arrangements. senior personnel, with expertise in specific industries, inspect and approve credit reviews and internal credit ratings. our risk assessment process may also include, where applicable, reviewing certain key metrics, including, but not limited to, delinquency status, collateral value, fico credit scores and other risk factors. our credit risk management systems capture credit exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to counterparties and their subsidiaries. these systems also provide management with comprehensive information about our aggregate credit risk by product, internal credit rating, industry, country and region. risk measures we measure our credit risk based on the potential loss in the event of non-payment by a counterparty using current and potential exposure. for derivatives and securities financing transactions, current exposure represents the amount presently owed to us after taking into account applicable netting and collateral arrangements, while potential exposure represents our estimate of the future exposure that could arise over the life of a transaction based on market movements within a specified confidence level. potential exposure also takes into account netting and collateral arrangements. for loans and lending commitments, the primary measure is a function of the notional amount of the position. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis stress tests we conduct regular stress tests to calculate the credit exposures, including potential concentrations that would result from applying shocks to counterparty credit ratings or credit risk factors (e.g., currency rates, interest rates, equity prices). these shocks cover a wide range of moderate and more extreme market movements, including shocks to multiple risk factors, consistent with the occurrence of a severe market or economic event. in the case of sovereign default, we estimate the direct impact of the default on our sovereign credit exposures, changes to our credit exposures arising from potential market moves in response to the default, and the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties that may result from the sovereign default. unlike potential exposure, which is calculated within a specified confidence level, stress testing does not generally assume a probability of these events occurring. we also perform firmwide stress tests. see \"overview and structure of risk management\" for information about firmwide stress tests. to supplement these regular stress tests, as described above, we also conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis in response to specific market events that we deem significant. we also utilize these stress tests to estimate the indirect impact of certain hypothetical events on our country exposures, such as the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties along with the shocks to the risk factors described above. the parameters of these shocks vary based on the scenario reflected in each stress test. we review estimated losses produced by the stress tests in order to understand their magnitude, highlight potential loss concentrations, and assess and mitigate our exposures where necessary. limits we use credit risk limits at various levels, as well as underwriting standards to manage the size and nature of our credit exposures. limits for industries and countries are based on our risk appetite and are designed to allow for regular monitoring, review, escalation and management of credit risk concentrations. see \"overview and structure of risk management\" for information about the limit approval process. credit risk is responsible for monitoring these limits, and identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded. risk mitigants to reduce our credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions, we may enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. we may also reduce credit risk with counterparties by entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from them on an upfront or contingent basis and/or to terminate transactions if the counterparty's credit rating falls below a specified level. we monitor the fair value of the collateral to ensure that our credit exposures are appropriately collateralized. we seek to minimize exposures where there is a significant positive correlation between the creditworthiness of our counterparties and the market value of collateral we receive. for loans and lending commitments, depending on the credit quality of the borrower and other characteristics of the transaction, we employ a variety of potential risk mitigants. risk mitigants include collateral provisions, guarantees, covenants, structural seniority of the bank loan claims and, for certain lending commitments, provisions in the legal documentation that allow us to adjust loan amounts, pricing, structure and other terms as market conditions change. the type and structure of risk mitigants employed can significantly influence the degree of credit risk involved in a loan or lending commitment. when we do not have sufficient visibility into a counterparty's financial strength or when we believe a counterparty requires support from its parent, we may obtain third-party guarantees of the counterparty's obligations. we may also mitigate our credit risk using credit derivatives or participation agreements. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis credit exposures as of december 2022, our aggregate credit exposure

exposure on otc derivatives arises primarily from our market-making activities. as a market maker, we enter into derivative transactions to provide liquidity to clients and to facilitate the transfer and hedging of their risks. we also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures. we manage our credit exposure on otc derivatives using the credit risk process, measures, limits and risk mitigants described above. we generally enter into otc derivatives transactions under bilateral collateral arrangements that require the daily exchange of collateral. as credit risk is an essential component of fair value, we include a credit valuation adjustment (cva) in the fair value of derivatives to reflect counterparty credit risk, as described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. cva is a function of the present value of expected exposure, the probability of counterparty default and the assumed recovery upon default. the table below presents our net credit exposure

in significant disruptions in financial markets and increased macroeconomic uncertainty. governments around the world have responded to russia's invasion by imposing economic sanctions and export controls on specific industry sectors, companies and individuals in russia. retaliatory restrictions against investors, non-russian owned businesses and other sovereign states have been implemented by russia. businesses in the u.s. and globally continue to experience shortages in materials and increased costs for transportation, energy and raw materials due, in part, to the negative effects of the war on the global economy. the escalation or continuation of the war between russia and ukraine presents heightened risks relating to cyber attacks, limited ability to settle securities transactions, third-party and agent bank dependencies, supply chain disruptions, and inflation, as well as the potential for increased volatility in commodity, currency and other financial markets. complying with economic sanctions and restrictions imposed by governments has resulted in increased operational risk. the extent and duration of the war, sanctions and resulting market disruptions, as well as the potential adverse consequences for our business, liquidity and results of operations, are difficult to predict. our senior management, risk committees and the board receive regular briefings from our independent risk oversight and control functions, including our chief risk officer, on russian and ukrainian exposures, as well as other relevant risk metrics. we have significantly reduced our exposure to russia and ukraine and have curtailed our operations in russia to those necessary to meet our legal and regulatory obligations. the overall direct financial impact to our net revenues for 2022 from russian and ukrainian counterparties, borrowers, issuers and related instruments was not material. we have established a firmwide working group to identify and assess the operational risk associated with complying with economic sanctions and restrictions as a result of this invasion. in addition, to mitigate the risk of increased cyber attacks, we liaise with government agencies in order to update our monitoring processes with the latest information. our total credit exposure to russian or ukrainian counterparties or borrowers and our total market exposure relating to russian or

2022. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis we have a comprehensive framework to monitor, measure and assess our country exposures and to determine our risk appetite. we determine the country of risk by the location of the counterparty, issuer's assets, where they generate revenue, the country in which they are headquartered, the jurisdiction where a claim against them could be enforced, and/or the government whose policies affect their ability to repay their obligations. we monitor our credit exposure to a specific country both at the individual counterparty level, as well as at the aggregate country level. see \"stress tests\" for information about stress tests that are designed to estimate the direct and indirect impact of events involving the above countries. operational risk management overview operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or from external events. our exposure to operational risk arises from routine processing errors, as well as extraordinary incidents, such as major systems failures or legal and regulatory matters. potential types of loss events related to internal and external operational risk include: •execution, delivery and process management; •business disruption and system failures; •employment practices and workplace safety; •clients, products and business practices; •damage to physical assets; •internal fraud; and •external fraud. operational risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for developing and implementing a formalized framework for assessing, monitoring and managing operational risk with the goal of maintaining our exposure to operational risk at levels that are within our risk appetite. operational risk management process our process for managing operational risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the \"overview and structure of risk management,\" including a comprehensive data collection process, as well as firmwide policies and procedures, for operational risk events. we combine top-down and bottom-up approaches to manage and measure operational risk. from a top-down perspective, our senior management assesses firmwide and business-level operational risk profiles. from a bottom-up perspective, our first and second lines of defense are responsible for risk identification and risk management on a day-to-day basis, including escalating operational risks and risk events to senior management. we maintain a comprehensive control framework designed to provide a well-controlled environment to minimize operational risks. the firmwide operational risk and resilience committee is responsible for overseeing operational risk, and for ensuring operational resilience of our business. our operational risk management framework is designed to comply with the operational risk measurement rules under the capital framework and has evolved based on the changing needs of our businesses and regulatory guidance. we have established policies that require all employees and consultants to report and escalate operational risk events. when operational risk events are identified, our policies require that the events be documented and analyzed to determine whether changes are required in our systems and/or processes to further mitigate the risk of future events. we use operational risk management applications to capture, analyze, aggregate and report operational risk event data and key metrics. one of our key risk identification and control assessment tools is an operational risk and control self-assessment process, which is performed by our managers. this process consists of the identification and rating of operational risks, on a forward-looking basis, and the related controls. the results from this process are analyzed to evaluate operational risk exposures and identify businesses, activities or products with heightened levels of operational risk. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis risk measurement we measure our operational risk exposure using both statistical modeling and scenario analyses, which involve qualitative and quantitative assessments of internal and external operational risk event data and internal control factors for each of our businesses. operational risk measurement also incorporates an assessment of business environment factors, including: •evaluations of the complexity of our business activities; •the degree of automation in our processes; •new activity information; •the legal and regulatory environment; and •changes in the markets for our products and services, including the diversity and sophistication of our customers and counterparties. the results from these scenario analyses are used to monitor changes in operational risk and to determine business lines that may have heightened exposure to operational risk. these analyses are used in the determination of the appropriate level of operational risk capital to hold. we also perform firmwide stress tests. see \"overview and structure of risk management\" for information about firmwide stress tests. types of operational risks increased reliance on technology and third-party relationships has resulted in increased operational risks, such as information and cybersecurity risk, third-party risk and business resilience risk. we manage those risks as follows: information and cybersecurity risk. information and cybersecurity risk is the risk of compromising the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our data and systems, leading to an adverse impact to us, our reputation, our clients and/or the broader financial system. we seek to minimize the occurrence and impact of unauthorized access, disruption or use of information and/or information systems. we deploy and operate preventive and detective controls and processes to mitigate emerging and evolving information security and cybersecurity threats, including monitoring our network for known vulnerabilities and signs of unauthorized attempts to access our data and systems. there is increased information risk through diversification of our data across external service providers, including use of a variety of cloud-provided or -hosted services and applications. see \"risk factors\" in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k for further information about information and cybersecurity risk. third-party risk. third-party risk, including vendor risk, is the risk of an adverse impact due to reliance on third parties performing services or activities on our behalf. these risks may include legal, regulatory, information security, reputational, operational or any other risks inherent in engaging a third party. we identify, manage and report key third-party risks and conduct due diligence across multiple risk domains, including information security and cybersecurity, resilience and additional supply chain dependencies. the third-party risk program monitors, reviews and reassesses third-party risks on an ongoing basis. see \"risk factors\" in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k for further information about third-party risk. business resilience risk. business resilience risk is the risk of disruption to our critical processes. we monitor threats and assess risks and seek to ensure our state of readiness in the event of a significant operational disruption to the normal operations of our critical functions or their dependencies, such as critical facilities, systems, third parties, data and/or personnel. our resilience framework defines the fundamental principles for bcp and crisis management to ensure that critical functions can continue to operate in the event of a disruption. the business continuity program is comprehensive, consistent on a firmwide basis, and up-to-date, incorporating new information, including updated resilience capabilities as and when they become available. our resilience assurance program encompasses testing of response and recovery strategies on a regular basis with the objective of minimizing and preventing significant operational disruptions. see \"business - business continuity and information security\" in part i, item 1 of this form 10-k for further information about business continuity. model risk management overview model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions made based on model outputs that may be incorrect or used inappropriately. we rely on quantitative models across our business activities primarily to value certain financial assets and liabilities, to monitor and manage our risk, and to measure and monitor our regulatory capital. model risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units, model developers, model owners and model users, and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our model risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses, and provides periodic updates to senior management, risk committees and the risk committee of the board. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis our model risk management framework is managed through a governance structure and risk management controls, which encompass standards designed to ensure we maintain a comprehensive model inventory, including risk assessment and classification, sound model development practices, independent review and model-specific usage controls. the firmwide model risk control committee oversees our model risk management framework. model review and validation process model risk consists of quantitative professionals who perform an independent review, validation and approval of our models. this review includes an analysis of the model documentation, independent testing, an assessment of the appropriateness of the methodology used, and verification of compliance with model development and implementation standards. we regularly refine and enhance our models to reflect changes in market or economic conditions and our business mix. all models are reviewed on an annual basis, and new models or significant changes to existing models and their assumptions are approved prior to implementation. the model validation process incorporates a review of models and trade and risk parameters across a broad range of scenarios (including extreme conditions) in order to critically evaluate and verify: •the model's conceptual soundness, including the reasonableness of model assumptions, and suitability for intended use; •the testing strategy utilized by the model developers to ensure that the models function as intended; •the suitability of the calculation techniques incorporated in the model; •the model's accuracy in reflecting the characteristics of the related product and its significant risks; •the model's consistency with models for similar products; and •the model's sensitivity to input parameters and assumptions. see \"critical accounting policies - fair value - review of valuation models,\" \"liquidity risk management,\" \"market risk management,\" \"credit risk management\" and \"operational risk management\" for further information about our use of models within these areas. other risk management in addition to the areas of risks discussed above, we also manage other risks, including capital, climate, compliance and conflicts. these areas of risks are discussed below. capital risk management capital risk is the risk that our capital is insufficient to support our business activities under normal and stressed market conditions or we face capital reductions or rwa increases, including from new or revised rules or changes in interpretations of existing rules, and are therefore unable to meet our internal capital targets or external regulatory capital requirements. capital adequacy is of critical importance to us. accordingly, we have in place a comprehensive capital management policy that provides a framework, defines objectives and establishes guidelines to maintain an appropriate level and composition of capital in both business-as-usual and stressed conditions. our capital management framework is designed to provide us with the information needed to identify and comprehensively manage risk, and develop and apply projected stress scenarios that capture idiosyncratic vulnerabilities with a goal of holding sufficient capital to remain adequately capitalized even after experiencing a severe stress event. see \"capital management and regulatory capital\" for further information about our capital management process. we have established a comprehensive governance structure to manage and oversee our day-to-day capital management activities and to ensure compliance with capital rules and related policies. our capital management activities are overseen by the board and its committees. the board is responsible for approving our annual capital plan and the risk committee of the board approves our capital management policy, which details the risk committees and members of senior management who are responsible for the ongoing monitoring of our capital adequacy and evaluation of current and future regulatory capital requirements, the review of the results of our capital planning and stress tests processes, and the results of our capital models. in addition, our risk committees and senior management are responsible for the review of our contingency capital plan, key capital adequacy metrics, including regulatory capital ratios, and capital plan metrics, such as the payout ratio, as well as monitoring capital targets and potential breaches of capital requirements. our process for managing capital risk also includes independent review by risk that, among other things, assesses regulatory capital policies and related interpretations, escalates certain interpretations to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, and performs calculation testing to corroborate alignment with applicable capital rules. climate risk management we categorize climate risk into physical risk and transition risk. physical risk is the risk that asset values may decline or operations may be disrupted as a result of changes in the climate, while transition risk is the risk that asset values may decline because of changes in climate policies or changes in the underlying economy due to decarbonization. goldman sachs 2022 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis as a global financial institution, climate-related risks manifest in different ways across our businesses and we have continued to make significant enhancements to our climate risk management framework, including steps to further integrate climate into our broader risk management processes. we have integrated oversight of climate-related risks into our risk management governance structure, from senior management to our board and its committees, including the risk and public responsibilities committees. the risk committee of the board oversees firmwide financial and nonfinancial risks, which include climate risk, and, as part of its oversight, receives updates on our risk management approach to climate risk, including our approaches towards scenario analysis and integration into existing risk management processes. the public responsibilities committee of the board assists the board in its oversight of our firmwide sustainability strategy and sustainability issues affecting us, including with respect to climate change. as part of its oversight, the public responsibilities committee receives periodic updates on our sustainability strategy, and also periodically reviews our governance and related policies and processes for sustainability and climate change-related risks. senior management within risk is responsible for the development of our climate risk program. we have begun incorporating climate risk into our credit evaluation and underwriting processes for select industries. climate risk factors are now evaluated as part of transaction due diligence for select loan commitments. see \"business - sustainability\" in part i, item 1 and \"risk factors\" in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k for information about our sustainability initiatives, including in relation to climate transition. compliance risk management compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to our reputation arising from our failure to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations, and our internal policies and procedures. compliance risk is inherent in all activities through which we conduct our businesses. our compliance risk management program, administered by compliance, assesses our compliance, regulatory and reputational risk; monitors for compliance with new or amended laws, rules and regulations; designs and implements controls, policies, procedures and training; conducts independent testing; investigates, surveils and monitors for compliance risks and breaches; and leads our responses to regulatory examinations, audits and inquiries. we monitor and review business practices to assess whether they meet or exceed minimum regulatory and legal standards in all markets and jurisdictions in which we conduct business. conflicts management conflicts of interest and our approach to dealing with them are fundamental to our client relationships, our reputation and our long-term success. the term \"conflict of interest\" does not have a universally accepted meaning, and conflicts can arise in many forms within a business or between businesses. the responsibility for identifying potential conflicts, as well as complying with our policies and procedures, is shared by all of our employees. we have a multilayered approach to resolving conflicts and addressing reputational risk. our senior management oversees policies related to conflicts resolution and, in conjunction with conflicts resolution, legal and compliance, and internal committees, formulates policies, standards and principles, and assists in making judgments regarding the appropriate resolution of particular conflicts. resolving potential conflicts necessarily depends on the facts and circumstances of a particular situation and the application of experienced and informed judgment. as a general matter, conflicts resolution reviews financing and advisory assignments in global banking & markets and certain of our investing, lending and other activities. in addition, we have various transaction oversight committees, such as the firmwide capital, commitments and suitability committees and other committees that also review new underwritings, loans, investments and structured products. these groups and committees work with internal and external counsel and compliance to evaluate and address any actual or potential conflicts. the head of conflicts resolution reports to our chief legal officer, who reports to our chief executive officer. we regularly assess our policies and procedures that address conflicts of interest in an effort to conduct our business in accordance with the highest ethical standards and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. for further information about our risk management processes, see \"overview and structure of risk management\" and \"risk

(3)sales per retail square foot represents sales divided by retail store square footage. sales per retail square foot is a measure of the efficiency of sales based on the total square footage of our stores and is used by management to monitor the performance of the company's retail operations as an indicator of the productivity of owned and leased square footage for these retail operations. fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 sales we assess our sales performance by evaluating both net sales and comparable sales. net sales. net sales for fiscal 2022 increased $6.2 billion, or 4.1%, to $157.4 billion. the increase in net sales for fiscal 2022 primarily reflected the impact of positive comparable sales driven by an increase in comparable average ticket, partially offset by a decrease in comparable customer transactions. a stronger u.s. dollar negatively impacted net sales by $339 million in fiscal 2022. fiscal 2022 form 10-k table of contents online sales, which consist of sales generated online through our websites and mobile applications for products picked up at our stores or delivered to customer locations, represented 14.2% of net sales and grew by 7.4% during fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. the increase in online sales in fiscal 2022 was a result of customers continuing to leverage our digital platforms and reflects our ongoing investments to enhance these platforms and related fulfillment capabilities, which support our interconnected retail strategy. comparable sales. comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the change in net sales for a period over the comparable prior-period of equivalent length. comparable sales includes sales at all locations, physical and online, open greater than 52 weeks (including remodels and relocations) and excludes closed stores. retail stores become comparable on the monday following their 52nd week of operation. acquisitions are typically included in comparable sales after they have been owned for more than 52 weeks. comparable sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with gaap. total comparable sales increased 3.1% in fiscal 2022, reflecting an 8.8% increase in comparable average ticket, partially offset by a 5.4% decrease in comparable customer transactions compared to fiscal 2021. the increase in comparable average ticket was primarily driven by inflation, as well as demand for new and innovative products. the decrease in comparable customer transactions reflects the impact of macroeconomic factors during fiscal 2022, including indications of price sensitivity to the broader inflationary environment and a gradual shift in consumer spending from goods back to services, resulting in transactions trending towards fiscal 2019, pre-covid-19 pandemic levels. for fiscal 2022, 10 of our 14 merchandising departments posted positive comparable sales, led by building materials, plumbing, millwork, paint, hardware, and kitchen and bath, which posted comparable sales above the company average. our indoor garden, outdoor garden, appliances, and flooring departments posted negative comparable sales. gross profit gross profit increased $1.9 billion, or 3.8%, to $52.8 billion in fiscal 2022. gross profit as a percent of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 33.5% in fiscal 2022 compared to 33.6% in fiscal 2021. the decrease in gross profit margin was primarily driven by higher product and transportation costs, pressure from shrink during the second half of the year, and investments in our supply chain network, offset by the benefit from higher retail prices, along with favorable product mix. operating expenses our operating expenses are composed of sg&a and depreciation and amortization. selling, general & administrative. sg&a increased $878 million, or 3.5%, to $26.3 billion in fiscal 2022. as a percent of net sales, sg&a was 16.7% in fiscal 2022 compared to 16.8% in fiscal 2021, primarily reflecting leverage from a positive comparable sales environment and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by wage investments for hourly associates and increased operational costs, including planned investments designed to drive efficiencies in our stores. depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization increased $69 million, or 2.9%, to $2.5 billion in fiscal 2022. as a percent of net sales, depreciation and amortization was 1.6% in both fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, reflecting leverage from a positive comparable sales environment, offset by increased depreciation expense from strategic investments in the business. interest and other, net interest and other, net increased $259 million, or 19.9%, to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2022. as a percent of net sales, interest and other, net, was 1.0% in fiscal 2022 compared to 0.9% in fiscal 2021, primarily reflecting higher interest expense due to higher debt balances and increased variable rate interest on floating rate debt resulting from interest rate swaps, partially offset by leverage from a positive comparable sales environment. provision for income taxes our combined effective income tax rate was 23.9% in fiscal 2022 compared to 24.4% in fiscal 2021. the decrease in our effective income tax rate in fiscal 2022 was driven by certain discrete tax benefits recognized in fiscal 2022. fiscal 2022 form 10-k table of contents diluted earnings per share diluted earnings per share were $16.69 in fiscal 2022 compared to $15.53 in fiscal 2021. the increase in diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by higher net earnings during fiscal 2022, as well as lower diluted shares due to share repurchases. non-gaap financial measures to provide clarity on our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with certain non-gaap financial measures. however, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures. non-gaap financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies. return on invested capital we believe roic is meaningful for investors and management because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base. we define roic as nopat, a non-gaap financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by average debt and equity. we define average debt and equity as the average of beginning and ending long-term debt (including current installments) and equity for the most recent twelve-month period. the following table presents the calculation of roic, together with a reconciliation of nopat to net earnings (the most comparable gaap measure): fiscal fiscal fiscal dollars in millions 2022 2021 2020 net earnings $17,105 $16,433 $12,866 interest and other, net 1,562 1,303 1,300 provision for income taxes 5,372

40.8 % (1)income tax adjustment is defined as operating income multiplied by our effective tax rate for the trailing twelve months. liquidity and capital resources at january 29, 2023, we had $2.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which $825 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. we believe that our current cash position, cash flow generated from operations, funds available from our commercial paper program, and access to the long-term debt capital markets should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements, any required debt payments, and satisfaction of other contractual obligations, but also to enable us to invest in the business, fund dividend payments, and fund any share repurchases through the next several fiscal years. in addition, we believe we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing, if necessary. our material cash requirements include contractual and other obligations arising in the normal course of business. these obligations primarily include long-term debt and related interest payments, operating and finance lease obligations, and purchase obligations. in addition to our cash requirements, we follow a disciplined approach to capital allocation. this approach first prioritizes investing in the business, followed by paying dividends, with the intent of then returning excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. for fiscal 2023, we plan to invest approximately $3 billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditures, in line with our expectation of approximately two percent of net sales on an annual basis. however, we may adjust our capital expenditures to support the operations of the business, to enhance long-term strategic positioning, or in response to the economic environment, as necessary or appropriate. capital expenditures were $3.1 billion in fiscal 2022. fiscal 2022 form 10-k table of contents during fiscal 2022, we paid cash dividends of $7.8 billion to shareholders. in february 2023, we announced a 10% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $1.90 to $2.09 per share. we intend to pay a dividend in the future; however, any future dividend is subject to declaration by the board of directors based on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other factors considered relevant by our board of directors. in august 2022, our board of directors approved a $15.0 billion share repurchase authorization that replaced the previous authorization of $20.0 billion, which was approved in may 2021. this new authorization does not have a prescribed expiration date. as of january 29, 2023, approximately $12.5 billion of the $15.0 billion share repurchase authorization remained available. during fiscal 2022, we had cash payments of $6.7 billion for repurchases of our common stock through open market purchases. debt in july 2022, we expanded our commercial paper program from $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion to further enhance our financial flexibility. all of our short-term borrowings in fiscal 2022 were under our commercial paper program, and the maximum amount outstanding at any time was $2.7 billion. in connection with our program, we have back-up credit facilities with a consortium of banks. in july 2022, we also expanded the borrowing capacity under these back-up facilities from $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion by entering into a five-year $3.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in july 2027 and a 364-day $1.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in july 2023. these facilities replaced our previously existing five-year $2.0 billion credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in december 2023, and our 364-day $1.0 billion credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in december 2022. at january 29, 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program, and we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in our credit facilities, none of which are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. we also issue senior notes from time to time as part of our capital management strategy. in march 2022, we issued $4.0 billion of senior notes. the net proceeds from this issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding indebtedness and repurchases of shares of our common stock. in september 2022, we issued an additional $3.0 billion of senior notes. the net proceeds from this issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of our common stock. during fiscal 2022, we repaid $2.25 billion of senior notes. at january 29, 2023, we had an aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding of $41.2 billion, with $1.0 billion payable within 12 months. future interest payments associated with these senior notes total $24.9 billion, with $1.7 billion payable within 12 months, based on current interest rates, which include the impact of our active interest rate swap agreements. the indentures governing our senior notes do not generally limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. the indentures governing the notes contain various customary covenants; however, none are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt arrangements. leases we use operating and finance leases largely to fund a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers, and store support centers. at january 29, 2023, we had aggregate lease obligations of $14.7 billion, with $1.5 billion payable within 12 months. aggregate lease obligations include $2.1 billion of obligations related to leases not yet commenced. see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our operating and finance leases. purchase obligations and other purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, media and sponsorship spend, software and license commitments, and legally binding service contracts. we issue inventory purchase orders in the ordinary course of business, which are typically cancellable by their terms, therefore we do not consider purchase orders that are cancellable to be firm inventory commitments. at january 29, 2023, we had aggregate purchase obligations of $1.8 billion, with $947 million payable within 12 months. at january 29, 2023, we had aggregate liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits totaling $643 million, none of which are expected to be paid in the next 12 months. the timing of payment, if any, associated with our long-term unrecognized tax benefit liabilities is unknown. see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our unrecognized tax benefits. we have no material off-balance sheet arrangements. fiscal 2022 form 10-k table of contents cash flows summary operating activities cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, associate compensation, operations, occupancy costs, and income taxes. cash provided by or used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. working capital at any point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $2.0 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, primarily driven by changes in working capital, slightly offset by an increase in net earnings. changes in working capital were driven by inventory management actions and the related timing of vendor payments. these inventory management actions, which began in fiscal 2021 and moderated during the second half of fiscal 2022, reflect strategic investments in inventory to support the demand environment, promote higher in-stock levels, and pull forward merchandise for seasonal events in response to global supply chain disruption, as well as investments in our new supply chain facilities. investing activities cash used in investing activities increased by $171 million in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, primarily resulting from increased capital expenditures, partially offset by cash paid for an acquired business during fiscal 2021. financing activities cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2022 primarily reflected $7.8 billion of cash dividends paid, $6.7 billion of share repurchases, $2.5 billion of repayments of long-term debt, and $1.0 billion of net repayments of short-term debt, partially offset by $6.9 billion of net proceeds from long-term debt. cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 primarily reflected $14.8 billion of share repurchases, $7.0 billion of cash dividends paid, and $1.5 billion of repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by $3.0 billion of net proceeds from long-term debt and $1.0 billion of net proceeds from short-term debt. fiscal 2021 reflected elevated share repurchase activity following the temporary suspension of repurchases during fiscal 2020 in order to enhance our liquidity position at the onset of the covid-19 pandemic. fiscal 2022 form 10-k table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. actual results could differ from those estimates. our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting estimates, which are those that are both important to the representation of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates. merchandise inventories we value the majority of our inventory under the retail inventory method, using the first-in, first-out method, with the remainder of our inventories valued under a cost method. under the retail inventory method, inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. the retail value of our inventory is adjusted as needed to reflect current market conditions. because these adjustments are based on current prevailing market conditions, the value of our inventory approximates the lower of cost or market. the valuation under the retail inventory method is based on a number of factors such as markups, markdowns, and inventory losses (or shrink). as such, there exists an inherent uncertainty in the final determination of inventory cost and gross profit. we determine markups and markdowns based on the consideration of a variety of factors such as current and anticipated demand, customer preferences and buying trends, age of the merchandise, and weather conditions. we calculate shrink based on actual inventory losses identified as a result of physical inventory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts. the estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inventory counts is calculated on a store-specific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink results. a 10% increase in the shrink rate used to estimate our inventory shrink reserve would have increased cost of sales by approximately $113 million for fiscal 2022. historically, the difference between estimated shrink and actual inventory losses has not been material to our annual financial results. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood for a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to value our inventory under the retail inventory method. we believe that the retail inventory method provides an inventory valuation which approximates cost and results in valuing our inventory at the lower of cost or market. additional information for information on our accounting policies and on accounting pronouncements that have impacted or are expected to materially impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.\"\"\"\n\n    Instruction:\n    Identify and summarize all sentences or phrases that are directly or indirectly related to \"organizational resilience\", including but not limited to:

organizational resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” (vogus & sutcliffe, 2007: 3418). organizational resilience is defined as the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity. resilience can be defined as the system’s ability to maintain its integrity and its performance, at least partially, while under internal or external variations and disturbances (i.e. pressures, constraints, failures, errors, violations, hazards), whether nominal, extreme, or exceptional. defined as a company’s ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from a challenging situation. we develop a trajectory model of organizational resilience that focuses on how actors project temporal trajectories of responses toward disruptive events, reconstitute the trajectories in immediate response to the event, and reconfigure the trajectories toward the ensuing future. the concept of resilience draws attention to systems as well as individuals, to partial maintenance of integrity and performance, to the opposite of brittleness, and to disturbances that vary both in scale and source. resilience is a multifaceted concept that reflects businesses’ ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change to survive, grow, and flourish.\"\"\"\n\n    Text:\n    \"\"\"item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is intended to provide readers of our consolidated financial statements with the perspectives of management. this should allow the readers of this report to obtain a comprehensive understanding of our businesses, strategies, current trends, and future prospects. our md&a includes the following sections: • executive overview: high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business. • critical accounting policies and estimates: policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments underlying our financial statements. • results of operations: a more detailed discussion of our revenue and expenses. • liquidity and capital resources: discussion of key aspects of our consolidated statements of cash flows, changes in our consolidated balance sheets, and our financial commitments. you should note that this md&a contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. please see the section entitled \"forward-looking statements\" immediately preceding part i for important information to consider when evaluating such statements. you should read this md&a in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 of this annual report. due to the ongoing covid-19, pandemic we continue to conduct business with modifications to employee work locations. nearly all of our sites are now fully open. we are transitioning to a hybrid model where our workforce will spend a portion of their time working in our offices and a portion of their time working from home. we continue to evaluate and refine our return to workplace strategy. the russia-ukraine war and related sanctions imposed as a result of this conflict have increased global economic and political uncertainty. intuit does not have offices or material business in russia or ukraine. while we have not experienced significant disruptions to our operations from the covid-19 pandemic or the russia-ukraine war, we are unable to predict the full impact that these events will have on our operations and future financial performance, including demand for our offerings, impact to our customers and partners, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, impact to the overall macroeconomic environment, and other factors identified in \"risk factors\" in item 1a of part i of this annual report. in april 2020, intuit was approved as a non-bank small business administration lender for the paycheck protection program (ppp). the ppp was authorized under the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act (cares act) to provide small businesses loans to pay payroll and group health costs, salaries and commissions, mortgage and rent payments, utilities, and interest on other debt which is designed to provide assistance to small businesses during the covid-19 pandemic. on december 3, 2020, we acquired credit karma in a business combination, which operates as a separate reportable segment. we have included their results of operations in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. segment operating income for credit karma includes all direct expenses related to selling and marketing, product development, and general and administrative, which is different from our other reportable segments where we do not fully allocate corporate expenses. therefore, credit karma segment operating income is not comparable to the segment operating income of our other reportable segments. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information. on november 1, 2021, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of the rocket science group llc (mailchimp). mailchimp is part of our small business & self-employed segment. we have included the results of mailchimp in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information. on august 1, 2022, to better align our personal finance strategy, our mint offering moved from our consumer segment to our credit karma segment. we have included the results of mint in the consumer segment in the segment results below. revenue and operating results for mint are not significant and the previously reported segment results have not been reclassified. effective august 1, 2022, the operating results for mint will be included in the credit karma segment. on august 1, 2022, we renamed our proconnect segment as the protax segment. this segment continues to serve professional accountants. intuit fiscal 2018 form 10-k tables of contents executive overview this overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business. we believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2022 as well as our future prospects. this summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. industry trends and seasonality industry trends artificial intelligence (ai) is transforming multiple industries, including financial technology. disruptive start-ups, emerging ecosystems and mega-platforms are harnessing new technology to create personalized experiences, deliver data-driven insights and increase speed of service. these shifts are creating a more dynamic and highly competitive environment where customer expectations are shifting around the world as more services become digitized and the array of choices continues to increase. seasonality our consumer and proconnect offerings have a significant and distinct seasonal pattern as sales and revenue from our income tax preparation products and services are typically concentrated in the period from november through april. this seasonal pattern typically results in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending january 31 and april 30, respectively. in fiscal 2022, the irs began accepting returns on january 24, 2022, and the tax filing deadline was april 18, 2022. however, in fiscal 2021, the irs began accepting returns on february 12, 2021, and the tax filing deadline was may 17, 2021. in fiscal 2020, the irs began accepting returns on january 27, 2020, and the tax filing deadline was july 15, 2020. as a result of the extensions of the tax filing deadlines in 2021 and 2020, a significant amount of our fiscal 2021 and 2020 consumer segment and proconnect segment revenues were recognized in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2022. we expect the seasonality of our consumer and proconnect businesses to continue to have a significant impact on our quarterly financial results in the future. key challenges and risks our growth strategy depends upon our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new markets, and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market. our future growth also increasingly depends on the strength of our third-party business relationships and our ability to continue to develop, maintain, and strengthen new and existing relationships. to remain competitive and continue to grow, we are investing significant resources in our product development, marketing, and sales capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. as we offer more online services, the ongoing operation and availability of our platforms and systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important. because we help customers manage their financial lives, we face risks associated with the hosting, collection, use, and retention of personal customer information and data. we are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. for our consumer and professional tax offerings, we have implemented additional security measures and are continuing to work with state and federal governments to implement industry-wide security and anti-fraud measures, including sharing information regarding suspicious filings. we received iso 27001 certification for a portion of our systems, and we continue to invest in security measures and to work with the broader industry and government to protect our customers against this type of fraud. additionally, credit karma's security measures are regularly reviewed and updated. for a complete discussion of the most significant risks and uncertainties affecting our business, please see \"forward-looking statements\" immediately preceding part i and \"risk factors\" in item 1a of part i of this annual report. intuit fiscal 2022 form 10-k tables of contents overview of financial results the most important financial indicators that we use to assess our business are revenue growth for the company as a whole and for each reportable segment; operating income growth for the company as a whole; earnings per share; and cash flow from operations. we also track certain non-financial drivers of revenue growth and, when material, identify them in the applicable discussions of segment results below. service offerings are a significant part of our business. our total service and other revenue was $11.0 billion or 86% of our

2020, while fiscal 2022 includes the full twelve months of operations. critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), we are required to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue, operating income or loss and net income or loss, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. we believe that the estimates, assumptions, and judgments involved in the following accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies: •revenue recognition •business combinations •goodwill, acquired intangible assets, and other long-lived assets - impairment assessments •legal contingencies •accounting for income taxes - estimates of deferred taxes, valuation allowances, and uncertain tax positions our senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this annual report on form 10-k with the audit and risk committee of our board of directors. intuit fiscal 2022 form 10-k tables of contents revenue recognition we derive our revenue primarily from the sale of online services such as tax, accounting, payroll, merchant payment processing, delivery of qualified links, e-commerce, marketing automation, customer relationship management, and packaged desktop software products and desktop software subscriptions. our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services. in determining how revenue should be recognized, a five-step process is used, which requires judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process. the primary judgments include identifying the performance obligations in the contract and determining whether the performance obligations are distinct. if any of these judgments were to change it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue we report in a particular period. for additional information, see \"revenue recognition\" in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report. business combinations as described in \"description of business and summary of significant accounting policies - business combinations,\" in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report, under the acquisition method of accounting we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. we measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred, which we also measure at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. the acquisition method of accounting requires us to exercise judgment and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, and contingencies. this method allows us to refine these estimates over a one-year measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. if we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could materially decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our consolidated balance sheet. significant estimates and assumptions that we must make in estimating the fair value of acquired technology, customer lists, and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could record impairment charges. in addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. if our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed. goodwill, acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets - impairment assessments we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. we test for potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or whenever indicators of impairment arise. the timing of the annual test may result in charges to our consolidated statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods. as described in \"description of business and summary of significant accounting policies - goodwill, acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets,\" in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report, in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model (known as the income approach) and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses (known as the market approach). the income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions, including market factors specific to the business, the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time, long-term growth rates for the business, and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. we evaluate cash flows at the reporting unit level. although the assumptions we use in our discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our internal strategic plans and forecasts, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from each reporting unit and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. when using the market approach, we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses. we base our judgments on factors such as size, growth rates, profitability, risk, and return on investment. we also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue, operating income, and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own businesses. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a summary of goodwill by reportable segment. we estimate the recoverability of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite useful lives by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate. in order to estimate the fair value of those assets, we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets. the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. we also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite lives. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in intuit fiscal 2022 form 10-k tables of contents\"\"\"\n\n    Instruction:\n    Identify and summarize all sentences or phrases

organizational resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” (vogus & sutcliffe, 2007: 3418). organizational resilience is defined as the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity. resilience can be defined as the system’s ability to maintain its integrity and its performance, at least partially, while under internal or external variations and disturbances (i.e. pressures, constraints, failures, errors, violations, hazards), whether nominal, extreme, or exceptional. defined as a company’s ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from a challenging situation. we develop a trajectory model of organizational resilience that focuses on how actors project temporal trajectories of responses toward disruptive events, reconstitute the trajectories in immediate response to the event, and reconfigure the trajectories toward the ensuing future. the concept of resilience draws attention to systems as well as individuals, to partial maintenance of integrity and performance, to the opposite of brittleness, and to disturbances that vary both in scale and source. resilience is a multifaceted concept that reflects businesses’ ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change to survive, grow, and flourish.\"\"\"\n\n    Text:\n    \"\"\"item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview open surgery remains the predominant form of surgery and is used in almost every area of the body. however, the large incisions required for open surgery create trauma to patients, typically resulting in longer hospitalization and recovery times, increased hospitalization costs, and additional pain and suffering relative to minimally invasive surgery, where mis is available. for over three decades, mis has reduced trauma to patients by allowing selected surgeries to be performed through small ports rather than large incisions. mis has been widely adopted for certain surgical procedures. da vinci surgical systems enable surgeons to extend the benefits of mis to many patients who would otherwise undergo a more invasive surgery by using computational, robotic, and imaging technologies to overcome many of the limitations of traditional open surgery or conventional mis. surgeons using a da vinci surgical system operate while seated comfortably at a console viewing a 3d, high-definition image of the surgical field. this immersive console connects surgeons to the surgical field and their instruments. while seated at the console, the surgeon manipulates instrument controls in a natural manner, similar to open surgical technique. our technology is designed to provide surgeons with a range of articulation of the surgical instruments used in the surgical field analogous to the motions of a human wrist, while filtering out the tremor inherent in a surgeon's hand. in designing our products, we focus on making our technology easy and safe to use. our da vinci products fall into five broad categories: da vinci surgical systems, da vinci instruments and accessories, da vinci stapling, da vinci energy, and da vinci vision, including firefly fluorescence imaging systems and da vinci endoscopes. we also provide a comprehensive suite of systems, learning, and services offerings. digitally-enabled for nearly three decades, these three offerings aim to decrease variability by providing dependable, consistent functionality and an integrated user experience. our systems category includes robotic platforms, software, vision, energy, and instruments and accessories. our learning category includes educational technology, such as simulation and telepresence, as well as technical training programs and personalized peer-to-peer learning opportunities. our services category assists and optimizes minimally invasive programs through readiness, on-demand support, consultation for minimally invasive program optimization, and hospitals customized analytics. within our integrated ecosystem, our focus is to decrease variability in surgery by offering actionable insights, with digital solutions, to take action with the potential to improve outcomes, personalize learning, and optimize efficiency. we take a holistic approach, offering intelligent technology and systems designed to work together to make mis intervention more available and applicable. we have commercialized the following da vinci surgical systems: the da vinci standard surgical system in 1999, the da vinci s surgical system in 2006, the da vinci si surgical system in 2009, and the fourth generation da vinci xi surgical system in 2014. we extended our fourth-generation platform by adding the da vinci x surgical system, commercialized in 2017, and the da vinci sp surgical system, commercialized in 2018. the da vinci sp surgical system accesses the body through a single incision, while the other da vinci surgical systems access the body through multiple incisions. all da vinci systems include a surgeon's console (or consoles), imaging electronics, a patient-side cart, and computational hardware and software. we are in the early stages of launching our da vinci sp surgical system, and we have an installed base of 121 da vinci sp surgical systems as of december 31, 2022. we have received fda clearance for the da vinci sp surgical system for urologic and certain transoral procedures, and we have received regulatory clearance in south korea, where the da vinci sp surgical system may be used for a broad set of procedures. in september 2022, we also received regulatory clearance for the da vinci sp surgical system in japan for the same set of procedures as can be performed on the da vinci xi surgical system in japan. we plan to seek fda clearances for additional indications for da vinci sp over time. we also plan to seek clearances in other ous markets over time. the success of the da vinci sp surgical system is dependent on positive experiences and improved clinical outcomes for the procedures for which it has been cleared as well as securing additional clinical clearances. we offer approximately 70 different multi-port da vinci instruments to provide surgeons with flexibility in choosing the types of tools needed to perform a particular surgery. these multi-port instruments are generally robotically controlled and provide end effectors (tips) that are similar to those used in either open or laparoscopic surgery. we offer advanced instrumentation for the da vinci x and da vinci xi platforms, including da vinci energy and da vinci stapler products, to provide surgeons with sophisticated, computer-aided tools to precisely and efficiently interact with tissue. da vinci x and da vinci xi surgical systems share the same instruments, whereas the da vinci si surgical system uses instruments that are not compatible with da vinci x or da vinci xi systems. we currently offer nine core instruments on our da vinci sp surgical system. we plan to expand the sp instrument offering over time. training technologies include our intuitive simulation products, our intuitive telepresence remote case observation and telementoring tools, and our dual console for use in surgeon proctoring and collaborative surgery. in 2019, the fda cleared our ion endoluminal system to enable minimally invasive biopsies in the lung. our ion system extends our commercial offering beyond surgery into diagnostic procedures with this first application. our rollout of the ion table of contents system is progressing well, and we are continuing to gather additional clinical evidence. we plan to seek additional clearances for the ion system in ous markets over time. the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, pricing, competition, market and consumer acceptance, the effective forecasting and management of product demand, inventory levels, the management of manufacturing and supply costs, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. macroeconomic environment uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic factors in the u.s. and globally characterized by the supply chain environment, inflationary pressure, rising interest rates, labor shortages, and significant disruption in the commodities' markets as a result of the russia and ukraine conflict may result in a recession, which could have a material adverse effect on our long-term business. we have experienced increased difficulties in obtaining a sufficient supply of a number of component materials used in our products, such as semiconductor components as well as a range of other materials, including, but not limited to, metals and polymers, as global supply has become significantly constrained due to increased demand for certain materials. additionally, prices of such materials have increased due to the increased demand and supply shortage. with rising interest rates, access to credit may become more difficult, and any insolvency of key suppliers, including sole-source and single-source suppliers, may exacerbate current supply chain challenges. we are engaged in activities to seek to mitigate supply disruptions, but the global supply chain shortages will remain a challenge for the foreseeable future. such global shortages in important components as well as certain logistics challenges have resulted in, and will continue to cause, inflationary cost pressure in our supply chain. to date, these supply chain challenges have not materially impacted our results of operations or ability to deliver products and services to our customers. however, if shortages in important supply chain materials in the semiconductor or other markets or logistics challenges continue, we could fail to meet product demand, which could result in deferred or canceled procedures. if inflationary pressures in logistics or component costs persist, we may not be able to adjust pricing, reduce costs, or implement countermeasures. additionally, there is uncertainty surrounding the impact of any monetary policy changes taken by the u.s. federal reserve and other central banks to address the structural risks associated with inflation. fluctuations in labor availability globally, including labor shortages and staff burnout and attrition, could also impact our ability to hire and retain personnel critical to our manufacturing, logistics, and commercial operations. we are also highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff. the loss of critical members of our team, or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel, could significantly harm our operations, business, and ability to compete. the current macroeconomic environment is impacting our customers financially and operationally as well. hospitals are experiencing staffing shortages and supply chain issues that could affect their ability to provide patient care. additionally, hospitals are facing significant financial pressure as supply chain constraints and inflation drive up operating costs, rising interest rates make access to credit more expensive, unrealized losses decrease available cash reserves, and fiscal stimulus programs enacted during the covid-19 pandemic wind down. as a consequence of the financial pressures and decreased profitability, some hospitals have indicated that they are lowering their capital investment plans and tightening their operational budgets. we believe that these factors have contributed to a softening in our u.s. capital pipeline, and we expect that demand for capital, particularly in the u.s., will continue to be impacted while macroeconomic conditions remain challenging. in addition, as competition progresses in various markets, we will likely experience longer selling cycles and pricing pressures. any or all of these factors could negatively impact the number of da vinci procedures performed or the number of system placements and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations resulting in failure to achieve our anticipated financial results. covid-19 pandemic procedures in 2020, as a result of the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (covid-19), we saw a substantial reduction in da vinci procedures. the initial decline in procedures in the first quarter of 2020 was significant, most notably in china and then later in western europe and the u.s. as the pandemic spread. the second quarter of 2020 saw a further significant decline in procedures, followed by a period of recovery and new resurgences. in the u.s., procedures initially continued to decline, before starting a recovery as covid-19 cases dropped and elective procedures were permitted. in china, procedure volumes recovered strongly, while the impact on procedure volumes of other countries varied. the third and fourth quarters of 2020 were characterized by the continued recovery of procedure volumes in the u.s. and china, while the procedure volumes of other countries, such as japan, continued to vary depending on the spread and/or resurgence of covid-19. in 2021, covid-19 resurgences affected da vinci procedure volumes at various times throughout the year in most of the markets that we operate in. after each resurgence, as covid-19 cases and hospitalizations subsided, we saw procedure table of contents volumes recover. in the u.s., the impact of high covid-related hospitalization rates on procedure volumes was exacerbated by staffing shortages. although hospitals were better equipped to handle covid patients as compared to the outset of the pandemic, covid-19 resurgences challenged hospital resources and negatively impacted da vinci procedure volumes. in addition, delays in diagnosis and treatment of underlying conditions had a negative impact on da vinci procedure volumes. volumes associated with benign procedures were generally impacted to a higher degree when covid-19 cases and hospitalizations increased, reflecting the deferability of certain elective surgeries. in early 2022, a resurgence of covid-19 resulted in a significant increase in infections and hospitalization rates in the u.s. and certain countries in europe, which, in turn, negatively impacted procedure volumes in january and february. as infections and hospitalizations started to decrease in february in the u.s. and europe, we saw a recovery of procedure volumes. in march and during the second quarter of 2022, we also saw a resurgence in covid-19 cases and increased hospitalizations and government interventions impacting parts of asia, particularly china, which negatively impacted procedure volumes. during the third quarter of 2022, we did not experience significant disruptions from covid-19. in the fourth quarter of 2022, we saw a resurgence in covid-19 cases in china, which had a significant negative impact on our procedure volumes in the region. the depth and extent to which the covid-19 pandemic will impact individual markets will vary based on the availability of vaccinations, personal protective equipment, intensive care units and operating rooms, and medical staff, as well as government interventions. the impact of covid-19 on our procedure volumes varies widely by country, region, and type. when covid-19 infection rates spike in a particular region, procedure volumes have been negatively impacted and the diagnoses of new conditions and their related treatments have been deferred. while there is a backlog of patients, it is unpredictable when those patients will ultimately seek diagnosis and treatment and whether they will be treated through surgery. based on our experience during the last three years, we do not expect all markets, regions, and procedure types to recover at the same time or at the same pace. system demand as the impact of the covid-19 pandemic progressed throughout 2020, customers in affected regions deferred decisions to purchase or lease systems into future quarters and, in some cases, indefinitely. in addition, the year-over-year stagnation in procedures during 2020 and, in turn, reduced utilization of our systems had resulted in unused capacity in the existing installed base. on the other hand, throughout 2021, we experienced strong system demand, as utilization levels recovered. in general, we believe that the covid-19 pandemic had less of an impact on hospital spending capacity and that customers recognize that surgery meets their quadruple aim objectives better than other surgical approaches. this system demand continued during 2022; however, in 2022, our system demand was also impacted by macroeconomic challenges impacting our customers, primarily in the u.s. refer to the factors outlined in the macroeconomic environment section above. customer relief program in april 2020, we announced a program to provide financial relief to our customers. the program consisted of three main elements. the first element provided credits against service fees otherwise due in the six-month period from april 1 through september 30, 2020, which generally reflected the underutilization of the system during that period. those credits were offered to most customers worldwide. the second element of the program deferred certain lease payments, and the third element extended certain payment terms. service fee credits resulted in an $80 million decrease in service revenue in 2020. while the short-term payment relief offered did not have a material impact on the results of operations, we deferred $15 million of lease billings and extended payment terms associated with $181 million of trade receivables during the program, of which $19 million remained outstanding as of december 31, 2020. all of the trade receivables with extended payment terms were collected as of december 31, 2021. we may be subject to increased credit risks resulting in collection delinquencies and defaults, which could materially impact our bad debt write-offs and provisions for credit losses. although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risks, there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing credit risks relating to these lease financing arrangements and extended payment terms. there was no similar customer relief program offered in 2021 or 2022. general increase in risks the covid-19 pandemic and local actions, such as \"shelter-in-place\" orders and restrictions on our ability to travel and access our customers or temporary closures of our facilities, including our training and manufacturing operations, or the facilities of our suppliers and their contract manufacturers, could further significantly impact our sales and our ability to produce and ship our products and supply our customers. in addition, covid-19 has contributed to the staffing shortages experienced by hospitals, which impacts hospitals' ability to provide patient care and, in some cases, results in the deferral of elective surgeries. table of contents our response our priorities and actions during the covid-19 pandemic have been and remain as follows. first, we are focused on the health and safety of all those we serve-patients, customers, our communities, and our employees-implementing continuous updates to our health and safety policies and processes. second, we are supporting our customers according to their priorities-clinical, operational, and economic-and ensuring continuity of supply by working with our suppliers and our distributors. third, we are securing our workforce economically. we have built a valuable team over the years, and we believe they will be important in a recovery that follows the pandemic. finally, we will continue to invest in our priority development programs while eliminating avoidable spend. as covid-19 vaccination rates increase and the severity of cases declines, we are implementing our return-to-office strategy. we collected internal and external insights to inform decision-making on work models that would align with how employees will work in the current environment, which has evolved as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. these efforts will allow for an improved employee experience, regardless of whether an employee is working from home, fully on-site, or in a hybrid fashion. our top priority in this process continues to be the health and safety of our employees. business model overview we generate revenue from the placement of da vinci surgical systems, in sales or sales-type lease arrangements where revenue is recognized up-front or in operating lease and usage-based arrangements where revenue is recognized over time. we earn recurring revenue from the sales of instruments, accessories, and services, as well as the revenue from operating leases. the da vinci surgical system generally sells for between $0.5 million and $2.5 million, depending upon the model, configuration, and geography, and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers when purchased. our instruments and accessories have limited lives and will either expire or wear out as they are used in surgery, at which point they need to be replaced. we generally earn between $600 and $3,500 of instruments and accessories revenue per surgical procedure performed, depending on the type and complexity of the specific procedures performed and the number and type of instruments used. in late 2020, we launched our extended use program (refer to further discussion in the section below) in the u.s. and europe, with the intention to reduce the cost for customers to treat patients, which in turn will reduce our overall instruments and accessories revenue per procedure. we typically enter into service contracts at the time systems are sold or leased at an annual fee between $80,000 and $190,000, depending upon the configuration of the underlying system and the composition of the services offered under the contract. these service contracts have generally been renewed at the end of the initial contractual service periods. we generate revenue from our ion endoluminal system in a business model consistent with the da vinci surgical system model described above. we generate revenue from the placement of ion systems, in sales or sales-type lease arrangements where revenue is recognized up-front or in operating lease and usage-based arrangements where revenue is recognized over time. we earn recurring revenue from the sales of instruments, accessories, and services, as well as revenue from operating leases. the average selling price of an ion system is generally significantly lower than the average selling price of a da vinci surgical system. for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, ion's contribution to revenue and gross margin was not significant. additionally, as part of our ecosystem of products and services, we provide a portfolio of learning offerings and digital solutions. we do not currently generate material revenue from these offerings. extended use program in 2020, we introduced our extended use program in the u.s. and europe, which consists of select da vinci xi and da vinci x instruments possessing 12 to 18 uses compared to the previously 10 uses. these extended use instruments represent some of our higher volume instruments but exclude stapling, monopolar, and advanced energy instruments. instruments included in the program are used across a number of da vinci surgeries. their increased uses are the result of continuous, significant investments in the design and production capabilities of our instruments, resulting in improved quality and durability. extended use instruments were then launched in most other countries around the world in the first half of 2021, except china due to regulatory timelines. in addition, simultaneous with the regional launches of extended use instruments, we have lowered the price of certain instruments that are most commonly used in lower acuity procedures and/or lower reimbursed procedures within the region. these actions have reduced the cost for customers to treat patients, which in turn has reduced our revenue per procedure. in the u.s. and europe, during 2021, we saw customers adjust their instrument buying patterns to reduce their inventory levels to reflect the additional uses per instrument. we believe that, as of the end of 2021, in the u.s. and europe, full cutover to extended use instruments has occurred, as customers have substantially utilized all of their remaining 10 use instruments. the precise impact of these actions on future revenue will be dependent on the future volume and mix of procedures and whether cost elasticity will enable greater penetration into available markets. table of contents recurring revenue recurring revenue consists of instruments and accessories revenue, service revenue, and operating lease revenue. recurring revenue increased to $4.9 billion, or 79% of total revenue in 2022, compared to $4.3 billion, or 75% of total revenue in 2021, and $3.4 billion, or 77% of total revenue in 2020. instruments and accessories revenue has grown at a faster rate than systems revenue over time. instruments and accessories revenue increased to $3.52 billion in 2022, compared to $3.10 billion in 2021 and $2.46 billion in 2020. the increase in instruments and accessories revenue largely reflects continued procedure adoption. service revenue was $1.02 billion in 2022, compared to $0.92 billion in 2021 and $0.72 billion in 2020. the increase in service revenue was primarily driven by the growth of the base of installed da vinci surgical systems producing service revenue, as well as the effects of the customer relief program in 2020, which resulted in an $80 million decrease in service revenue. the installed base of da vinci surgical systems grew 12% to approximately 7,544 as of december 31, 2022; 12% to approximately 6,730 as of december 31, 2021; and 7% to approximately 5,989 as of december 31, 2020. we use the installed base, number of placements, and utilization of systems as metrics for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. management believes that the installed base, number of placements, and utilization of systems provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance, as management believes that the installed base, number of placements, and utilization of systems are an indicator of the rate of adoption of robotic-assisted surgery or bronchoscopy as well as an indicator of future recurring revenue. management believes that both it and investors benefit from referring to the installed base, number of placements, and utilization of systems in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. the installed base, number of placements, and utilization of systems also facilitate management's internal comparisons of our historical performance. we believe that the installed base, number of placements, and utilization of systems are useful to investors as metrics because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, and (2) they are used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the performance of our business. the vast majority of installed systems are connected via the internet. system logs can also be accessed by field engineers for systems that are not connected to the internet. we utilize this information as well as other information from agreements and discussions with our customers that involve estimates and judgments, which are, by their nature, subject to substantial uncertainties and assumptions. estimates and judgments for determining the installed base, number of placements, and utilization of systems may be impacted over time by various factors, including system internet connectivity, hospital and distributor reporting behavior, and inherent complexities in new agreements. such estimates and judgments are also susceptible to technical errors. in addition, the relationship between the installed base, number of placements, and utilization of systems and our revenues may fluctuate from period to period, and growth in the installed base, number of placements, and utilization of systems may not correspond to an increase in revenue. the installed base, number of placements, and utilization of systems are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, revenue or other financial information prepared and presented in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (\"gaap\"). intuitive system leasing since 2013, we have entered into sales-type and operating lease arrangements directly with certain qualified customers as a way to offer customers flexibility in how they acquire systems and expand their robotic-assisted programs while leveraging our balance sheet. these leases generally have commercially competitive terms as compared to other third-party entities that offer equipment leasing. we have also entered into usage-based arrangements with qualified customers that have committed da vinci programs where we charge for the system and service as the systems are utilized. we believe that these alternative financing structures have been effective and well-received, and we are willing to expand the proportion of these structures based on customer demand. we include operating and sales-type leases, and systems placed under usage-based arrangements, in our system placement and installed base disclosures. we exclude operating lease-related revenue, usage-based revenue, and ion system revenue from our da vinci surgical system average selling price (\"asp\") computations. in the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we placed 591, 668, and 432 da vinci surgical systems, respectively, under lease and usage-based arrangements, of which 492, 517, and 317 systems, respectively, were operating lease and usage-based arrangements. in the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we placed 112, 57, and 9 ion systems, respectively, under lease and usage-based arrangements, of which 101, 50, and 9 systems, respectively, were operating lease and usage-based arrangements. revenue from operating lease arrangements is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term or, in the case of usage-based arrangements, as the systems are used. we generally set operating lease and usage-based pricing at a modest premium relative to purchased systems reflecting the time value of money and, in the case of usage-based arrangements, the risk that system utilization may fall short of anticipated levels. variable lease revenue recognized from usage-based arrangements has been included in our operating lease metrics herein. operating lease revenue has grown at a faster rate than overall systems revenue and was $377 million, $277 million, and $177 million for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021, table of contents and 2020, respectively, of which $133 million, $78 million, and $28 million, respectively, was variable lease revenue. as revenue for operating leases and usage-based systems is recognized over time, total systems revenue growth is reduced in a period when the number of operating lease and usage-based placements increases as a proportion of total system placements. generally, lease transactions generate similar gross margins as our sale transactions. a total of 1,683, 1,294, and 901 da vinci surgical systems were installed at customers under operating lease or usage-based arrangements as of december 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. a total of 132, 61, and 11 ion systems were installed at customers under operating lease or usage-based arrangements as of december 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. our exposure to the credit risks relating to our lease financing arrangements may increase if our customers are adversely affected by changes in healthcare laws, coverage and reimbursement, economic pressures or uncertainty, or other customer-specific factors. as a result of these macroeconomic factors impacting our customers, we may be exposed to defaults under our lease financing arrangements. moreover, usage-based arrangements generally contain no minimum payments; therefore, customers may exit such arrangements without paying a financial penalty to us. for some operating lease arrangements, our customers are provided with the right to purchase the leased system at certain points during and/or at the end of the lease term. revenue generated from customer purchases of systems under operating lease arrangements (\"lease buyouts\") was $72 million, $96 million, and $52 million for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. we expect that revenue recognized from customer exercises of the buyout options will fluctuate based on the timing of when, and if, customers choose to exercise their buyout options. systems revenue system placements are driven by procedure growth in most markets. in some markets, system placements are constrained by regulation. in geographies where da vinci procedure adoption is in an early stage or system placements are constrained by regulation, system sales will precede procedure growth. system placements also vary due to seasonality largely aligned with hospital budgeting cycles. we typically place a higher proportion of annual system placements in the fourth quarter and a lower proportion in the first quarter as customer budgets are reset. systems revenue is also affected by the proportion of system placements under operating lease and usage-based arrangements, recurring operating lease and usage-based revenue, operating lease buyouts, product mix, asps, trade-in activities, and customer mix. systems revenue declined 1% to $1.68 billion in 2022. systems revenue grew 44% to $1.69 billion in 2021. systems revenue declined 12% to $1.18 billion in 2020. based on the factors outlined in the covid-19 pandemic section above, we believe that historical system placement trends may not be a good indicator of future system placements. procedure mix / products our da vinci surgical systems are generally used for soft tissue surgery for areas of the body between the pelvis and the neck, primarily in general surgery, gynecologic surgery, urologic surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, and head and neck surgery. within these categories, procedures range in complexity from cancer and other highly complex procedures to less complex procedures for benign conditions. cancer and other highly complex procedures tend to be reimbursed at higher rates than less complex procedures for benign conditions. thus, hospitals are more sensitive to the costs associated with treating less complex, benign conditions. our strategy is to provide hospitals with attractive clinical and economical solutions across the spectrum of procedure complexity. our fully featured da vinci xi surgical system with advanced instruments (including da vinci energy and endowrist and sureform stapler products) and our integrated table motion product targets the more complex procedure segment. our da vinci x surgical system is targeted toward price-sensitive markets and procedures. our da vinci sp surgical system complements the da vinci xi and x surgical systems by enabling surgeons to access narrow workspaces. procedure seasonality more than half of da vinci procedures performed are for benign conditions, most notably hernia repairs, hysterectomies, and cholecystectomies. these benign procedures and other short-term elective procedures tend to be more seasonal than cancer operations and surgeries for other life-threatening conditions. seasonality in the u.s. for procedures for benign conditions typically results in higher fourth quarter procedure volume when more patients have met annual deductibles and lower first quarter procedure volume when deductibles are reset. seasonality outside of the u.s. varies and is more pronounced around local holidays and vacation periods. as a result of the factors outlined in the covid-19 pandemic section above, including past and potentially future recommendations of authorities to defer elective procedures, historical procedure patterns may be disrupted. distribution channels we provide our products through direct sales organizations in the u.s., europe (excluding spain, portugal, italy, greece, and most eastern european countries), china (through our intuitive-fosun pharma joint venture), japan, south korea, india, taiwan and, as of june 2022, canada. in the remainder of our ous markets, we provide our products through distributors. table of contents regulatory activities overview our products must meet the requirements of a large and growing body of international standards that govern the product safety, efficacy, advertising, labeling, safety reporting design, manufacture, materials content and sourcing, testing, certification, packaging, installation, use, and disposal of our products. examples of such standards include electrical safety standards, such as those of the international electrotechnical commission, and composition standards, such as the reduction of hazardous substances and the waste electrical and electronic equipment directives. failure to meet these standards could limit our ability to market our products in those regions that require compliance with such standards. our products and operations are also subject to increasingly stringent medical device, privacy, and other regulations by regional, federal, state, and local authorities. after a device is placed on the market, numerous fda and other regulatory requirements continue to apply. these requirements include establishment registration and device listing with the fda and compliance with medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the fda if their device caused or contributed, or may have caused or contributed, to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. we recently revised our medical device reporting policies, which had been developed based on previous feedback from the fda. these revisions have been made in consultation with the fda to better align with existing regulations. there has been an increase in medical device reporting filings due to changes in our reportability criteria. in addition, we have been investing in resources and utilizing external experts to strengthen our quality system. these efforts are ongoing. we also anticipate that timelines for the introduction of new products and/or indications may be extended relative to past experience as a result of these regulations. for example, we have seen elongated regulatory approval timelines in the u.s. and europe. clearances, approvals, and certifications we have generally obtained the regulatory clearances, approvals, and certifications required to market our products associated with our da vinci surgical multiport systems (standard, s, si, xi, and x systems) for our targeted surgical specialties within the u.s., south korea, japan, and the european markets in which we operate. since 2020, we have obtained regulatory clearances, approvals, and certifications for the following products: •in september 2022, we obtained regulatory clearance for the da vinci sp surgical system in japan for use in general surgeries, thoracic surgeries (excluding cardiac procedures and intercostal approaches), urologic surgeries, gynecological surgeries, and trans-oral head and neck surgeries. we obtained the initial fda clearance for our da vinci sp surgical system in april 2014 and have since invested in important platform refinements. we also received regulatory clearance in south korea for our da vinci sp surgical system in may 2018. •in february 2022, we received regulatory clearance in china to market both our 12 mm sureform 45 stapler and sureform 60 stapler and corresponding reloads. •in january 2022, we received regulatory clearance in china to market our da vinci vessel sealer extend with up to 7 mm vascular indications. •in december 2021, we obtained fda clearance for our 8 mm sureform 30 curved-tip stapler and reloads for use in general, thoracic, gynecologic, urologic, and pediatric surgery. the 8 mm sureform 30 curved-tip stapler is expected to launch in the u.s. in 2023, with other countries to follow. in october 2022, we received regulatory clearance in japan to market our 8 mm sureform 30 curved-tip and straight-tip stapler instruments and reloads for use in general, thoracic (except for cardiac), gynecologic, and urologic surgery. •in late 2020 and early 2021, we obtained fda clearance, european certification, and other regulatory clearances in most of our significant markets to market our extended use instruments. •in november 2019, we obtained fda clearance for our synchroseal instrument and e-100 generator. following the fda clearance, in february 2020, we obtained european certification for both products. in march 2020, we received regulatory clearance in japan to market both our synchroseal instrument and e-100 generator. we received regulatory clearance in south korea to market our synchroseal instrument and e-100 generator in january 2020 and august 2020, respectively. •in july 2019, we obtained fda clearance for our sureform 45 curved-tip stapler and sureform 45 gray reload, which round out our sureform 45 portfolio. we have also obtained european certification for our sureform 45 curved-tip stapler and sureform 45 gray reload. in september 2019, we received regulatory clearance in japan to market both our sureform 45 curved-tip stapler and sureform 45 gray reload. we received regulatory clearance in south korea to market our sureform 45 curved-tip stapler and sureform 45 gray reload in june 2021 and july 2021, respectively. •in june 2019, we obtained european certification for our da vinci endoscope plus for the da vinci xi and da vinci x surgical systems in europe. following the european certification, in july 2019, we obtained fda clearance for our da vinci endoscope plus. we have also received regulatory clearances in south korea and japan to market our da vinci endoscope plus in december 2019 and may 2020, respectively. in march 2022, we received regulatory clearance in china to market our da vinci endoscope plus. •in june 2019, we obtained fda clearance for our da vinci handheld camera and, in february 2020, we obtained european certification. refer to the descriptions of our new products that received regulatory clearances, approvals, or certifications in 2022, 2021, and 2020 in the recent product introductions section below. in october 2018, the china national health commission published on its official website the quota for major medical equipment to be sold in china through 2020. after an adjustment notice was published in the third quarter of 2020, the government will now allow for the total sale of 225 new surgical robots into china, which could include da vinci surgical systems as well as surgical systems introduced by others. as of december 31, 2022, we have sold 187 da vinci surgical systems under this quota, and we believe that four system quotas are no longer available; therefore, 34 surgical robots should still be available for sale under this quota. future sales of da vinci surgical systems under the quota are uncertain, as they are dependent on hospitals completing a tender process and receiving associated approvals. additionally, any delays in the granting of a new quota in china will constrain our ability to further grow our installed base in china as well as limit our capacity for procedure growth in china. during the third quarter of 2022, the hunan provincial healthcare security administration implemented significant limits on what hospitals can charge patients for surgeries using robotic surgical technology, including soft tissue surgery and orthopedics. this rule has had a material negative impact on our procedures performed in the hunan province. in addition to the hunan province, the hainan province (an island province of china) recently announced a policy to implement almost identical limits on what hospitals can charge patients for surgeries using robotic surgical technology. however, currently, only a small portion of our installed base in china is located in the hunan and hainan provinces. companies providing robotic surgical technology, including our joint venture in china, are meeting with chinese government healthcare agencies to discuss this development and provide feedback. we cannot assure you that other provincial healthcare administrations will not impose similar limits. the japanese ministry of health, labor, and welfare considers reimbursement for procedures in april of even-numbered years. the process for obtaining reimbursement requires japanese university hospitals and surgical societies, with our support, to seek reimbursement. there are multiple pathways to obtain reimbursement for procedures, including those that require in-country clinical data/economic data. in april 2012 and april 2016, the mhlw granted reimbursement status for prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy, respectively. most prostatectomies and partial nephrectomies were open procedures prior to da vinci reimbursement. da vinci procedure reimbursement for prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy procedures are higher than open and conventional laparoscopic procedure reimbursements. an additional 12 da vinci procedures were granted reimbursement effective april 1, 2018, including gastrectomy, low anterior resection, lobectomy, and hysterectomy, for both malignant and benign conditions, and an additional seven da vinci procedures were granted reimbursement effective april 1, 2020. an additional eight da vinci procedures were granted reimbursement effective april 1, 2022, including colon resection. in addition, we received higher reimbursement for da vinci gastrectomy procedures, as compared to open and conventional laparoscopic procedure reimbursements. the additional reimbursed procedures have varying levels of conventional laparoscopic penetration and will generally be reimbursed at rates equal to the conventional laparoscopic procedures. given the reimbursement level and laparoscopic penetration for these additional procedures, there can be no assurance that the adoption pace for these procedures will be similar to prostatectomy or partial nephrectomy, given their higher reimbursement, or any other da vinci procedure. recalls and corrections medical device companies have regulatory obligations to correct or remove medical devices in the field that could pose a risk to health. the definition of \"recalls and corrections\" is expansive and includes repair, replacement, inspections, relabeling, and issuance of new or additional instructions for use or reinforcement of existing instructions for use and training when such actions are taken for specific reasons of safety or compliance. these field actions require stringent documentation, reporting, and monitoring worldwide. there are other actions that a medical device manufacturer may take in the field without reporting including, but not limited to, routine servicing and stock rotations. as we determine whether a field action is reportable in any regulatory jurisdiction, we prepare and submit notifications to the appropriate regulatory agency for the particular jurisdiction. regulators can require the expansion, reclassification, or change in scope and language of the field action. in general, upon submitting required notifications to regulators regarding a field action that is a recall or correction, we will notify customers regarding the field action, provide any additional documentation required in their national language, and arrange, as required, the return or replacement of the affected product or a field service visit to perform the correction. table of contents field actions, as well as certain outcomes from regulatory activities, can result in adverse effects on our business, including damage to our reputation, delays by customers of purchase decisions, reduction or stoppage of the use of installed systems, and reduced revenue as well as increased expenses. due to an internally-discovered defect in a component manufactured by a third party and used in certain da vinci arms, we will be issuing a voluntary field action on or about february 10, 2023. as agreed with the fda, the field action recommends that customers stop using approximately 109 da vinci x and xi systems until we can replace the affected arms, which we anticipate completing during february 2023. the affected part does not have patient contact, and there have been no adverse events reported related to this issue. we do not expect this field action to have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. procedures we model patient value as equal to procedure efficacy / invasiveness. in this equation, procedure efficacy is defined as a measure of the success of the surgery in resolving the underlying disease, and invasiveness is defined as a measure of patient pain and disruption of regular activities. when the patient value of a da vinci procedure is greater than that of alternative treatment options, patients may benefit from seeking out surgeons and hospitals that offer da vinci surgery, which could potentially result in a local market share shift. adoption of da vinci procedures occurs procedure by procedure and market by market and is driven by the relative patient value and total treatment costs of da vinci procedures as compared to alternative treatment options for the same disease state or condition. we use the number and type of procedures as metrics for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. management believes that the number and type of procedures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance, as management believes procedure volume is an indicator of the rate of adoption of robotic-assisted surgery or bronchoscopy as well as an indicator of future revenue (including revenue from usage-based arrangements). management believes that both it and investors benefit from referring to the number and type of procedures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. the number and type of procedures also facilitate management's internal comparisons of our historical performance. we believe that the number and type of procedures are useful to investors as metrics, because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, and (2) they are used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the performance of our business. the vast majority of our installed systems are connected via the internet. system logs can also be accessed by field engineers for systems that are not connected to the internet. we utilize certain methods that rely on information collected from the installed systems for determining the number and type of procedures performed that involve estimates and judgments, which are, by their nature, subject to substantial uncertainties and assumptions. estimates and judgments for determining the number and type of procedures may be impacted over time by various factors, including changes in treatment modalities, hospital and distributor reporting behavior, and system internet connectivity. such estimates and judgments are also susceptible to algorithmic or other technical errors. in addition, the relationship between the number and type of procedures and our revenues may fluctuate from period to period, and procedure volume growth may not correspond to an increase in revenue. the number and type of procedures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, revenue or other financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap. worldwide procedures our systems and instruments are regulated independently in various countries and regions of the world. the discussion of indications for use and representative or target procedures is intended solely to provide an understanding of the market for our products and is not intended to promote for sale or use any intuitive product outside of its licensed or cleared labeling and indications for use. the adoption of robotic-assisted surgery using the da vinci surgical system has the potential to grow for those procedures that offer greater patient value than to non-da vinci alternatives and competitive total economics for healthcare providers. our da vinci surgical systems are used primarily in general surgery, urologic surgery, gynecologic surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, and head and neck surgery. we focus our organization and investments on developing, marketing, and training products and services for procedures in which da vinci can bring patient value relative to alternative treatment options and/or economic benefit to healthcare providers. target procedures in general surgery include hernia repair (both ventral and inguinal), colorectal, cholecystectomy, and bariatric procedures. target procedures in urology include prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy. target procedures in gynecology include hysterectomy for both cancer and benign conditions and sacrocolpopexy. in cardiothoracic surgery, target procedures include lobectomy. in head and neck surgery, target procedures include transoral surgery. not all indications, procedures, or products described may be available in a given country or region or on all generations of da vinci surgical systems. surgeons and their patients need to consult the product labeling in their specific country and for each product in order to determine the cleared uses, as well as important limitations, restrictions, or contraindications. table of contents similarly, the adoption of robotic-assisted bronchoscopy using the ion system has the potential to grow if it can offer greater patient value than non-ion alternatives and competitive total economics for healthcare providers. in 2022, approximately 1,875,000 surgical procedures were performed with da vinci surgical systems, compared to approximately 1,594,000 and 1,243,000 surgical procedures performed with da vinci surgical systems in 2021 and 2020, respectively. the increase in our overall procedure volume in 2022 reflects the disruption caused by the covid-19 pandemic in 2022 and 2021, as noted in the covid-19 pandemic section above, and was driven by growth in u.s. general surgery, ous urology, and ous general surgery (particularly cancer) procedures. in 2022, approximately 23,500 biopsy procedures were performed with ion systems, compared to approximately 7,400 and 1,700 biopsy procedures performed with ion systems in 2021 and 2020, respectively. the increase in our overall procedure volume in 2022 reflects a larger installed base of approximately 321 systems, an increase of 149% compared to the installed base of approximately 129 systems as of 2021. currently, the vast majority of ion biopsy procedures are performed in the u.s. u.s. da vinci procedures overall u.s. procedure volume with da vinci surgical systems grew to approximately 1,282,000 in 2022, compared to approximately 1,109,000 in 2021 and approximately 876,000 in 2020. general surgery was our largest and fastest growing u.s. specialty in 2022 with procedure volume that grew to approximately 720,000 in 2022, compared to approximately 588,000 in 2021 and approximately 434,000 in 2020. gynecology was our second largest u.s. surgical specialty in 2022 with procedure volume that grew to approximately 341,000 in 2022, compared to approximately 316,000 in 2021 and approximately 267,000 in 2020. urology was our third largest u.s. surgical specialty in 2022 with procedure volume that grew to approximately 162,000 in 2022, compared to approximately 153,000 in 2021 and approximately 134,000 in 2020. ous da vinci procedures overall ous procedure volume with da vinci surgical systems grew to approximately 593,000 in 2022, compared to approximately 485,000 in 2021 and approximately 367,000 in 2020. urology was our largest ous specialty in 2022 with procedure volume that grew to approximately 316,000 in 2022, compared to approximately 264,000 in 2021 and approximately 215,000 in 2020. general surgery was our second largest ous specialty in 2022 with procedure volume that grew to approximately 133,000 in 2022, compared to approximately 101,000 in 2021 and approximately 68,000 in 2020. gynecology procedures also contributed to ous procedure growth. recent business events and trends procedures overall. total da vinci procedures performed by our customers grew approximately 18% for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to approximately 28% for the year ended december 31, 2021. the 2022 and 2021 procedure results (and comparative 2020 procedures results) reflected disruption caused by the covid-19 pandemic, as noted in the covid-19 pandemic section above, which significantly impacted our procedures in certain periods in geographies and markets where there was a resurgence of the virus. the 2022 procedure growth was largely attributable to growth in u.s. general surgery, ous urology, and ous general surgery (particularly cancer) procedures. delays in both the diagnosis and treatments of diseases reflecting disruptions caused by covid-19 have previously and may continue to impact the number of procedures performed by our customers. u.s. procedures. u.s. da vinci procedures grew approximately 16% for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to approximately 27% for the year ended december 31, 2021. the 2022 and 2021 procedure results (and comparative 2020 procedures results) reflected disruption caused by the covid-19 pandemic, as noted in the covid-19 pandemic section above, which significantly impacted our procedures. the 2022 u.s. procedure growth was largely attributable to growth in general surgery procedures, most notably hernia repair, cholecystectomy, and bariatric procedures. growth in the more mature gynecologic and urologic procedure categories was more moderate. u.s. general surgery. general surgery procedures in the u.s. grew to approximately 720,000 in 2022, compared to approximately 588,000 in 2021 and approximately 434,000 in 2020. inguinal and ventral hernia repairs, cholecystectomies, and bariatric procedures contributed the most incremental procedures in 2022 and 2021, while cholecystectomies and bariatric procedures contributed the most incremental procedures in 2020. we believe that growth in hernia repair using da vinci reflects improved clinical outcomes within certain patient populations, as well as potential cost benefits relative to certain alternative treatments. we believe that hernia repair procedures represent a significant opportunity with the potential to drive growth in future periods. however, given the differences in surgical complexity associated with the treatment of various hernia patient populations and varying surgeon opinions regarding optimal surgical technique, it is difficult to estimate the timing of and to what extent hernia repair procedure volume will grow in the future. we expect a large portion of hernia repairs will continue to be performed via different modalities of surgery. table of contents given the already very high level of laparoscopic techniques used in cholecystectomy, it is unclear whether our growth is sustainable and to what extent da vinci may be adopted. bariatric procedures have grown significantly over the last three years. these procedures have been an increased area of focus and may also have benefited from certain patients prioritizing weight loss, as obesity is a significant covid-19 risk factor. in addition, our sureform 60mm stapler provides surgeons with a more optimized robotic tool set for bariatric procedures. however, the diagnoses and treatment pathways for bariatric patients are long, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to see significant growth in bariatric procedures in future periods. adoption of da vinci for colorectal procedures, which includes several underlying procedures, including low anterior resections for rectal cancers and certain colon procedures for benign and cancerous conditions, has been ongoing for several years and is supported by certain technologies, such as the endowrist and sureform staplers, energy devices, and integrated table motion. ous procedures. ous da vinci procedures grew approximately 22% for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to approximately 32% for the year ended december 31, 2021. the 2022 and 2021 procedure results (and comparative 2020 procedures results) reflected disruption caused by the covid-19 pandemic, as noted in the covid-19 pandemic section above, which significantly impacted our procedures. the 2022 ous procedure growth was driven by continued growth in urologic procedures, including prostatectomies and partial nephrectomies, and earlier stage growth in general surgery (particularly colorectal), gynecologic, and thoracic procedures. the 2022 ous procedure growth rate reflects continued da vinci adoption in european and asian markets. we saw strong procedure growth in japan, germany, and the uk during 2022. procedure growth in china was negatively impacted by covid-19 restrictions in effect during 2022, particularly during q2, and the subsequent effect of lifting those restrictions in q4, which resulted in a surge of covid-19 cases. we believe that growth in these global markets is being driven by increased acceptance among surgeons and health systems, supported by expanded global evidence validating the clinical and economic value of da vinci procedures as well as increased surgeon training. ous urology. along with general surgery, ous urology procedures have been a strong contributor to our overall procedure growth. ous urology procedures grew to approximately 316,000 in 2022, compared to approximately 264,000 in 2021 and approximately 215,000 in 2020. in the u.s., da vinci is the standard of care for the surgical treatment of prostate cancer, and we believe that the growth is largely aligned with surgical volumes of prostate cancer. for ous, prostatectomy is at varying states of adoption in different areas of the world but is the largest overall da vinci procedure. in 2022, we saw more moderate growth in ous prostatectomy procedures compared to higher growth in 2021, as we are further up the adoption curve. kidney cancer procedures have also been a strong contributor to our recent global urology procedure growth. clinical publications have demonstrated that the use of a da vinci system increases the likelihood that a patient will receive nephron sparing surgery through a partial nephrectomy, which is typically the surgical society guideline recommended therapy. ous general surgery. ous general surgery procedures grew to approximately 133,000 in 2022, compared to approximately 101,000 in 2021 and approximately 68,000 in 2020. colorectal procedures contributed the most incremental procedures in 2022, 2021, and 2020, aided by improved clinical outcomes relative to open and laparoscopic techniques within certain patient populations, along with enabling technologies, such as endowrist and sureform staplers, energy devices, and integrated table motion. system demand we placed 1,264 da vinci surgical systems in 2022, compared to 1,347 systems in 2021. the decrease in systems placed reflects a smaller number of third generation da vinci systems available for trade-in along with the macroeconomic challenges impacting our customers, primarily in the u.s. as a consequence of the macroeconomic challenges, some hospitals have indicated that they are lowering their capital investment plans and tightening operational budgets. we expect that demand for capital will be impacted while macroeconomic conditions remain challenging. 2022 da vinci placements declined 6% compared with 2021, and we expect that future placements of da vinci surgical systems will be impacted by a number of factors: supply chain risks; economic and geopolitical factors; inflationary pressures; rising interest rates; hospital staffing shortages; the impact of the current covid-19 pandemic, as noted in the covid-19 pandemic section above; hospital response to the evolving healthcare environment; procedure growth rates; hospital consolidation trends; evolving system utilization and point of care dynamics; capital replacement trends, including a declining number of older generation systems available for trade-in transactions; additional reimbursements in various global markets, including japan; the timing around governmental tenders and authorizations, including china; the timing of when we receive regulatory clearance in our other ous markets for our da vinci xi surgical system, da vinci x surgical system, and da vinci sp surgical system, and related instruments; and market response. market acceptance of our da vinci sp surgical system and the nature and timing of additional da vinci sp regulatory indications may also impact future system placements. table of contents demand may also be impacted by competition, including from companies that have introduced products in the field of robotic-assisted medical procedures or have made explicit statements about their efforts to enter the field including, but not limited to, the following companies: asensus surgical, inc.; avateramedical gmbh; cmr surgical ltd.; johnson & johnson; medicaroid corporation; medrobotics corporation; medtronic plc; meerecompany inc.; olympus corporation; samsung electronics co., ltd; shandong weigao group medical polymer company ltd.; shanghai microport medbot (group) co., ltd.; and titan medical inc. many of the above factors will also impact future demand for our ion system, as we extend our commercial offering into diagnostics, along with additional factors associated with a new product introduction, including, but not limited to, our ability to optimize manufacturing and our supply chain, competition, clinical data to demonstrate value, and market acceptance. recent product introductions sureform 30 curved-tip stapler and reloads. in december 2021, we obtained fda clearance for our 8 mm sureform 30 curved-tip stapler and reloads (gray, white, and blue) for use in general, thoracic, gynecologic, urologic, and pediatric surgery. we designed this instrument to help surgeons better visualize and reach anatomy through a combination of the 8 mm diameter instrument shaft and jaws, 120-degree cone of wristed articulation, and the curved tip. as it fits through the 8 mm da vinci surgical system instrument cannula, the stapler allows different angles for surgeons to approach patient anatomy. consistent with our other sureform staplers, the 8 mm sureform 30 curved-tip stapler integrates smartfire technology, which makes automatic adjustments to the firing process as staples are formed and the transection is made. the technology makes more than 1,000 measurements per second, helping achieve a consistent staple line. we completed initial evaluations of the 8 mm sureform 30 stapler with certain customers in the u.s. in 2022. the full u.s. product launch will occur in late 2023, with other countries to follow. in october 2022, we received regulatory clearance in japan to market our 8 mm sureform 30 curved-tip and straight-tip stapler instruments and reloads for use in general, thoracic (except for cardiac), gynecologic, and urologic surgery. synchroseal and e-100 generator. in november 2019, we obtained fda clearance for our synchroseal instrument and e-100 generator. following the fda clearance, in february 2020, we received european certification for both products. in march 2020, we received regulatory clearance in japan to market both our synchroseal instrument and e-100 generator. in august 2020, we received regulatory clearance in south korea to market our e-100 generator. synchroseal is a single-use, bipolar, electrosurgical instrument intended for grasping, dissection, sealing, and transection of tissue. with its wristed articulation, rapid sealing cycle, and refined curved jaw, synchroseal offers enhanced versatility to the da vinci energy portfolio. the e-100 generator is an electrosurgical generator developed to power two key instruments-vessel sealer extend and synchroseal-on the da vinci x and da vinci xi surgical systems. the generator delivers high frequency energy for cutting, coagulation, and vessel sealing of tissues. sureform 45 curved-tip stapler and gray reload. in july 2019, we obtained fda clearance for the sureform 45 curved-tip stapler and sureform 45 gray reload. we have also obtained european certification for our sureform 45 curved-tip stapler and sureform 45 gray reload. in september 2019, we received regulatory clearance in japan to market both our sureform 45 curved-tip stapler and sureform 45 gray reload. we received regulatory clearance in south korea to market our sureform 45 curved-tip stapler and sureform 45 gray reload in june 2021 and july 2021, respectively. sureform 45 curved-tip stapler is a single-use, fully wristed stapling instrument with a curved tip intended for resection, transection, and/or creation of anastomoses. sureform 45 gray reload is a new, single-use cartridge that contains multiple staggered rows of implantable staples and a stainless steel knife. the sureform 45 curved-tip stapler and gray reload have particular utility in thoracic procedures and round out our sureform 45 portfolio. not all reloads or staplers are available for use on all systems or in all countries. da vinci endoscope plus. in june 2019, we obtained european certification for our da vinci endoscope plus, an enhanced 3d endoscope for use with our da vinci x and xi surgical systems. following the european certification, in july 2019, we obtained fda clearance for our da vinci endoscope plus. we have also received regulatory clearances in south korea and japan to market our da vinci endoscope plus in december 2019 and may 2020, respectively. in march 2022, we received regulatory clearance in china to market our da vinci endoscope plus. the da vinci endoscope plus leverages new sensor technology to allow for increased sharpness and color accuracy. da vinci handheld camera. in june 2019, we obtained fda clearance for our da vinci handheld camera, a lightweight, 2d camera head, which can be connected to third-party laparoscopes. this allows the laparoscopic image to be displayed on the da vinci x/xi vision cart to address aspects of da vinci procedures that may require the use of a laparoscope, thus eliminating the need for redundant equipment in the operating room and increasing procedure efficiency. in february 2020, we obtained european certification for our da vinci handheld camera. we broadly launched the da vinci handheld camera in our european direct markets and in the u.s. in may 2020 and june 2020, respectively. table of contents acquisition of orpheus medical in february 2020, we acquired orpheus medical ltd. and its wholly owned subsidiaries to deepen and expand our integrated informatics platform. orpheus medical provides hospitals with information technology connectivity, as well as expertise in processing and archiving surgical videos. orpheus medical is a wholly owned subsidiary of intuitive. intuitive ventures in 2020, we launched intuitive ventures, an inaugural $100 million fund focused on investment opportunities in companies that share intuitive's commitment to advancing positive outcomes in healthcare. as of december 31, 2022, we have invested $33 million of the $100 million. 2022 operational and financial highlights •total revenue increased

total revenue total revenue increased by 9% to $6.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to $5.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021. total revenue for the year ended december 31, 2021, increased by 31% compared to $4.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in total revenue for the year ended december 31, 2022, resulted from 13% higher instruments and accessories revenue, driven by approximately 18% higher da vinci procedure volume, partially offset by foreign currency impacts and customer buying patterns, and 12% higher service revenue, partially offset by 1% lower systems revenue, driven by 6% lower da vinci system placements, partially offset by higher operating lease revenue. in conjunction with our 2020 covid-19 customer relief program implemented in the second quarter of 2020, service revenue in 2020 was reduced by $80 million as a result of service fee credits provided to customers. revenue denominated in foreign currencies as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 24%, 23%, and 23% for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. we generally sell our products and services in local currencies where we have direct distribution channels. foreign currency rate fluctuations, as determined by comparing current period revenue in usd to current period revenue in local currency using the same foreign exchange rates as the prior year same period, net of the impacts from foreign currency hedging, had an unfavorable impact on ous total revenue of $138 million for the year table of contents ended december 31, 2022, as compared to 2021. foreign currency rate fluctuations, net of the impacts from foreign currency hedging, had a favorable impact on ous total revenue of $35 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, as compared to 2020. revenue generated in the u.s. accounted for 67%, 67%, and 68% of total revenue for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. we believe that u.s. revenue has accounted for the large majority of total revenue due to u.s. patients' ability to choose their provider and method of treatment, reimbursement structures supportive of innovation and mis, and our initial investments focused on u.s. infrastructure. we have been investing in our business in ous markets, and our ous procedures have grown faster in proportion to u.s. procedures. we expect that our ous procedures and revenue will make up a greater portion of our business in the long term. the following table summarizes our revenue and system unit placements for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively (in millions, except percentages and unit placements): years ended december 31, 2022 2021 2020 revenue instruments

table of contents instruments and accessories revenue increased by 13% to $3.52 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to $3.10 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase in instruments and accessories revenue was primarily driven by da vinci procedure growth of approximately 18% and incremental sales of our advanced instruments. the increase was partially offset by foreign currency impacts, customer buying patterns, and hospitals normalizing their purchasing of new extended use instruments as a result of the recent launch of our extended use program. the 2022 u.s. da vinci procedure growth was approximately 16%, driven by strong growth in general surgery procedures, most notably hernia repair, cholecystectomy, and bariatric procedures, as well as moderate growth in the more mature gynecologic and urologic procedure categories. the 2022 ous da vinci procedure growth was approximately 22%, driven by continued growth in urologic procedures, including prostatectomies and partial nephrectomies, and earlier stage growth in general surgery (particularly colorectal), gynecologic, and thoracic procedures. both growth rates were impacted by the disruption caused by the covid-19 pandemic, as noted in the covid-19 pandemic section above. geographically, the 2022 ous da vinci procedure growth was driven by procedure expansion in a number of markets with particular strength in japan, germany, and the uk. we also saw procedure growth in china, despite the procedure growth rate being lower than the prior year as a result of an increase in covid-19 cases, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2022. systems revenue decreased by 1% to $1.68 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to $1.69 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease in systems revenue was primarily driven by lower sales-type lease revenue, fewer da vinci system placements, lower 2022 da vinci asps, lower lease buyout revenue, and a higher proportion of da vinci system placements under operating leases, partially offset by higher operating lease revenue and more ion system placements. during 2022, 1,264 da vinci surgical systems were placed compared to 1,347 systems during 2021. by geography, 692 systems were placed in the u.s., 280 in europe, 244 in asia, and 48 in other markets during 2022, compared to 865 systems placed in the u.s., 232 in europe, 203 in asia, and 47 in other markets during 2021. the decrease in system placements was primarily driven by a smaller number of third generation da vinci systems available for trade-in along with the macroeconomic challenges impacting our customers, primarily in the u.s. nevertheless, the incremental system placements reflect continued procedure growth and further customer validation that robotic-assisted surgery addresses their quadruple aim objectives. as of december 31, 2022, we had a da vinci surgical system installed base of approximately 7,544 systems, compared to an installed base of approximately 6,730 systems as of december 31, 2021. we placed 591 and 668 da vinci surgical systems under lease or usage-based arrangements, of which 492 and 517 systems were classified as operating leases for the years ended december 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. operating lease revenue, including the contribution from ion systems, was $377 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to $277 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. da vinci surgical systems placed as operating leases represented 39% of total placements during 2022, compared to 38% during 2021. 1,683 da vinci surgical systems were installed at customers under operating lease or usage-based arrangements as of december 31, 2022, compared to 1,294 systems as of december 31, 2021. revenue from lease buyouts was $72 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to $96 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. we expect revenue from lease buyouts to fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing of when, and if, customers choose to exercise the buyout options embedded in their leases. the da vinci surgical system asp, excluding systems placed under operating lease or usage-based arrangements and ion systems, was approximately $1.49 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to approximately $1.55 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the lower 2022 asp was largely driven by unfavorable foreign currency impacts, unfavorable geographic mix, and higher pricing discounts, partially offset by favorable product mix and fewer trade-ins. asp fluctuates from period to period based on geographic and product mix, product pricing, systems placed involving trade-ins, and changes in foreign exchange rates. during 2022, 192 ion systems were placed compared to 93 systems during 2021. we placed 112 and 57 ion systems under lease or usage-based arrangements, of which 101 and 50 systems were classified as operating leases for the years ended december 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. ion systems placed as operating leases represented 53% of total placements during 2022, compared to 54% during 2021. service revenue service revenue increased by 12% to $1.02 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to $0.92 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021. service revenue increased by 27% for the year ended december 31, 2021, compared to $0.72 billion for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in service revenue in 2022 was primarily driven by a larger installed base of da vinci surgical systems producing service revenue, partially offset by foreign currency impacts. the increase in service revenue in 2021 was primarily driven by a larger installed base of da vinci surgical systems producing service revenue, as well as the effects of the customer relief program in the prior year, which resulted in an $80 million decrease in service revenue in 2020 as a result of service fee credits provided to customers. table of contents gross profit product gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2022, increased by 5% to $3.50 billion, representing 67.3% of product revenue, compared to $3.33 billion, representing 69.5% of product revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2021. the higher product gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2022, was primarily driven by higher product revenue, partially offset by lower product gross profit margin. the lower product gross profit margin for the year ended december 31, 2022, was primarily driven by higher fixed overhead costs from investments to drive the growth of the business and strengthen our operating capabilities, higher freight and materials costs, unfavorable foreign currency impacts, and lower 2022 da vinci system asps. product gross profit for the years ended december 31, 2022, and 2021, included share-based compensation expense of $67.6 million and $68.9 million, respectively, and intangible assets amortization expense of $17.3 million and $17.6 million, respectively. service gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2022, increased by 11% to $0.70 billion, representing 68.2% of service revenue, compared to $0.63 billion, representing 68.6% of service revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2021. the higher service gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2022, was primarily driven by higher service revenue, reflecting a larger installed base of da vinci surgical systems, partially offset by a lower service gross profit margin. the lower service gross profit margin for the year ended december 31, 2022, was primarily driven by higher freight and overhead costs, as well as unfavorable foreign currency impacts, partially offset by lower materials costs for repairs. service gross profit for the years ended december 31, 2022, and 2021, included share-based compensation expense of $23.6 million and $22.2 million, respectively, and intangible assets amortization expense of $1.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively. selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses include costs for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, sales and marketing activities, trade show expenses, legal expenses, regulatory fees, and general corporate expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2022, increased by 19% to $1.74 billion, compared to $1.47 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2022, was primarily driven by higher headcount, resulting in increased fixed and share-based compensation expense, higher variable compensation, increased infrastructure costs to support our growth, and higher litigation charges, partially offset by favorable foreign currency impacts. in addition, there were higher travel, training, and marketing expenses for the year ended december 31, 2022, as compared with the prior year. in the fourth quarter of 2021, we made a charitable contribution of $30 million to the intuitive foundation, a not-for-profit organization whose mission is to reduce the global burden of disease and suffering through research, education, and philanthropy aimed at better outcomes for patients around the globe. selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31, 2022, and 2021, included share-based compensation expense of $261 million and $232 million, respectively, and intangible assets amortization expense of $5.9 million and $7.3 million, respectively. research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred. research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing, and significant enhancement of our products. research and development expenses for the year ended december 31, 2022, increased by 31% to $0.88 billion, compared to $0.67 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december 31, 2022, was primarily driven by higher personnel-related expenses, including share-based compensation expense, project costs incurred to support a broader set of product development initiatives, including future generations of robotics, ion and sp platform investments, and digital investments, and intangible asset-related charges. research and development expenses for the years ended december 31, 2022, and 2021, included share-based compensation expense of $164 million and $134 million, respectively, and intangible asset-related charges of $20.3 million and $11.1 million, respectively. research and development expenses fluctuate with project timing. based upon our broader set of product development initiatives and the stage of the underlying projects, we expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to increase in the future. table of contents interest and other income, net interest and other income, net, for the year ended december 31, 2022, decreased by 57% to $30 million, compared to $69 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. interest and other income, net decreased by 56% for the year ended december 31, 2021, compared to $157 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the decrease in interest and other income, net, for the year ended december 31, 2022, was primarily driven by unrealized losses on investments resulting from strategic arrangements (compared to unrealized gains on investments resulting from strategic arrangements in 2021) and higher foreign exchange losses, partially offset by higher interest income earned, despite lower cash and investment balances, due to an increase in average interest rates. we held an equity investment in preferred shares of broncus holding corporation (\"broncus\"), which was reflected in our consolidated financial statements on a cost basis. in the first quarter of 2021, we recorded an unrealized gain on our investment in broncus of approximately $14 million. in september 2021, broncus completed an initial public offering (\"ipo\") of common shares on the stock exchange of hong kong. upon completion of the ipo, the preferred shares were converted to common shares in broncus, and we recognized a net gain on this investment in the third quarter of 2021 of approximately $8 million. we were restricted from selling these shares for a period of six months. for the year ended december 31, 2022, we recognized a loss on this investment of approximately $21 million. we held an equity investment in common shares of bolder surgical holdings, inc. (\"bolder\"), which was reflected in our consolidated financial statements on a cost basis. during the fourth quarter of 2021, hologic, inc., a publicly traded company, completed its acquisition of bolder. under the terms of the acquisition agreement, we received cash on the date of closing and recognized a gain on this investment of approximately $10 million. we held an equity investment in preferred shares of intouch technologies, inc. (\"intouch\"), which was reflected in our consolidated financial statements on a cost basis. on july 1, 2020, teladoc health, inc. (\"teladoc\"), a publicly traded company, completed its acquisition of intouch. based on the terms of the agreement, we received teladoc shares on the date of closing and recognized a gain on our investment of approximately $45 million. we were restricted from selling these shares for a period of six months. in january 2021, we sold all of our shares in teladoc and recognized a gain on this investment of approximately $11 million. this gain was offset by a $7.5 million loss recognized upon the settlement of a corresponding derivative collar contract in january 2021. additionally, the company recorded unrealized gains on other strategic investments in 2020 of approximately $22 million. income tax expense income tax expense was $262 million and $162 million for the years ended december 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. our effective tax rate for 2022 was approximately 16.3% compared to 8.6% for 2021. our effective tax rates for 2022 and 2021 differed from the u.s. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the excess tax benefits associated with employee equity plans, the effect of income earned by certain overseas entities being taxed at rates lower than the federal statutory rate, and the federal research and development credit benefit, partially offset by u.s. tax on foreign earnings and state income taxes (net of federal benefit). the provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2022, reflected the impact of a change in u.s. tax law effective january 1, 2022, which requires the capitalization and amortization of research and development expenditures incurred after december 31, 2021. the increase in income tax expense for the year ended december 31, 2022, was primarily due to the impact of the capitalization of research and development and lower excess tax benefits, as discussed below, as well as the fact that income tax expense for the year ended december 31, 2021, included a one-time benefit of $66.4 million from the re-measurement of our swiss deferred tax assets resulting from the extension of the economic useful life of certain intangible assets. the increase was partially offset by a one-time charge of $13.6 million in 2021, which related to intercompany charges for share-based compensation for relevant periods prior to 2020, triggered by additional internal revenue service (\"irs\") guidance issued in july 2021 associated with a ninth circuit court of appeals opinion involving an independent third party. our provision for income taxes for 2022 and 2021 included excess tax benefits associated with employee equity plans of $99 million and $186 million, respectively, which reduced our effective tax rate by 6.1 and 9.8 percentage points, respectively. the amount of excess tax benefits or deficiencies will fluctuate from period to period based on the price of our stock, the volume of share-based awards settled or vested, and the value assigned to employee equity awards under gaap, which results in increased income tax expense volatility. on august 16, 2022, the inflation reduction act (\"ira\") was enacted in the united states. the ira introduces a 15% alternative minimum tax based on the financial statement income of certain large corporations, effective for tax years beginning after december 31, 2022. the ira also includes a 1% excise tax on the net fair market value of stock repurchases made after table of contents december 31, 2022. we have considered the applicable tax law changes, and there is no impact on our tax provision for the year ended december 31, 2022. we will continue to evaluate the impact of these tax law changes on future periods. we file federal, state, and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the u.s. and abroad. years prior to 2016 are considered closed for most significant jurisdictions. certain of our unrecognized tax benefits could change due to activities of various tax authorities, including evolving interpretations of existing tax laws in the jurisdictions we operate, potential assessment of additional tax, possible settlement of audits, or through normal expiration of various statutes of limitations, which could affect our effective tax rate in the period in which they change. due to the uncertainty related to the timing and potential outcome of audits, we cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible changes in unrecognized tax benefits that may occur in the next 12 months. we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities. the outcome of these audits cannot be predicted with certainty. management regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. if any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in joint venture the company's joint venture with fosun pharma was established to research, develop, manufacture, and sell robotic-assisted, catheter-based medical devices. the joint venture is owned 60% by us and 40% by fosun pharma and is located in china. the catheter-based technology will initially target early diagnosis and cost-effective treatment of lung cancer, one of the most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer in the world. distribution of catheter-based medical devices in china will be conducted by the joint venture, while distribution outside of china will be conducted by us. in january 2019, the joint venture acquired certain assets, including distribution rights, customer relationships, and certain personnel, from chindex and its affiliates, a subsidiary of fosun pharma, and began direct operations for da vinci products and services in china. as of december 31, 2022, the companies have contributed $55 million of up to $100 million required by the joint venture agreement. net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in joint venture for the year ended december 31, 2022, was $22.1 million, compared to $23.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, and $6.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in joint venture for the year ended december 31, 2022, was primarily due to a decrease in sales and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in china, partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense in china. liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents our principal source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and by the issuance of common stock through the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase program. cash and cash equivalents plus short- and long-term investments decreased by $1.88 billion to $6.74 billion as of december 31, 2022, from $8.62 billion as of december 31, 2021, primarily from cash used in share repurchases, capital expenditures, and taxes paid related to net share settlements of equity awards, as well as unrealized losses on interest-bearing debt securities classified as available for sale, offset by cash provided by our operations and proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases. cash and cash equivalents plus short- and long-term investments increased by $1.75 billion to $8.62 billion as of december 31, 2021, from $6.87 billion as of december 31, 2020, primarily from cash provided by our operations and proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases, partially offset by capital expenditures and taxes paid related to net share settlements of equity awards. our cash requirements depend on numerous factors, including market acceptance of our products, the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products, and other factors. we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to expand procedure adoption and acceptance of our products. we have made substantial investments in our commercial operations, product development activities, facilities, and intellectual property. based on our business model, we anticipate that we will continue to be able to fund future growth through cash provided by our operations. we believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, and investment balances, together with income to be derived from the sale of our products, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. however, we may experience reduced cash flow from operations as a result of the increasing risk of a recession along with other macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds. as of december 31, 2022, $396 million of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments was held by foreign subsidiaries. we intend to repatriate earnings from our swiss subsidiary and our joint venture in hong kong, as needed, since the u.s. and foreign tax implications of such repatriations are not expected to be significant. we will continue to indefinitely reinvest earnings from the rest of our foreign subsidiaries, which are not significant. table of contents see \"item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk\" for discussion on the impact of interest rate risk and market risk on our investment portfolio. consolidated cash flow data the following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 (in millions): years ended december 31, 2022 2021 2020 net cash provided by (used in): operating activities $1,490.8 $2,089.4 $1,484.8 investing activities 1,370.8 (2,461.5) (940.6) financing activities (2,572.3) 43.0

activities for the year ended december 31, 2022, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.49 billion exceeded our net income of $1.34 billion, primarily due to the following factors: 1.our net income included non-cash charges of $766 million, consisting primarily of the following significant items: share-based compensation of $513 million; depreciation expense and losses on the disposal of property, plant, and equipment of $338 million; changes in deferred income taxes of $(185) million; and net losses on investments, accretion, and amortization of $49 million. 2.the non-cash charges outlined above were partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in $619 million of cash used in operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2022. inventory, including the transfer of equipment from inventory to property, plant, and equipment, increased by $547 million, primarily to address the growth in the business as well as to mitigate risks of disruption that could arise from trade, supply, or other matters. refer to further details in the supplemental cash flow information in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. accounts receivable increased by $159 million, primarily due to the timing of billings and collections. prepaid expenses and other assets increased by $129 million, primarily due to an increase in net investments in sales-type leases and an increase in recoverable vat related to growth in our ous activities. the unfavorable impact of these items on cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by a $122 million increase in other liabilities, primarily due to additional accruals related to capital expenditures and timing of income tax payments, a $52 million increase in accrued compensation and employee benefits, primarily due to higher headcount and variable compensation, and a $21 million increase in accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of billing and payments. for the year ended december 31, 2021, net cash provided by operating activities of $2.09 billion exceeded our net income of $1.73 billion, primarily due to the following factors: 1.our net income included non-cash charges of $729 million, consisting primarily of the following significant items: share-based compensation of $449 million; depreciation expense and losses on the disposal of property, plant, and equipment of $283 million; changes in deferred income taxes of $(63) million; and amortization of intangible assets of $27 million. 2.the non-cash charges outlined above were partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in $368 million of cash used in operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2021. inventory, including the transfer of equipment from inventory to property, plant, and equipment, increased by $256 million, primarily to address the growth in the business as well as to mitigate risks of disruption that could arise from trade, supply, or other matters. refer to further details in the supplemental cash flow information in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. prepaid expenses and other assets increased by $205 million, primarily due to an increase in net investments in sales-type leases, and accounts receivable increased by $142 million, primarily due to the timing of billings and collections. the unfavorable impact of these items on cash used in operating activities was partially offset by a $115 million increase in accrued compensation and employee benefits, primarily due to higher headcount and variable compensation, a $51 million increase in other liabilities, primarily due to additional accruals related to capital expenditures and timing of income tax payments, a $36 million increase in accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of payments and vendor billings, and a $33 million increase in deferred revenue, primarily due to increased volume of sales contracts. table of contents investing activities net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2022, consisted primarily of proceeds from maturities and sales of investments, net of purchases, of $1.92 billion, partially offset by $532 million paid for the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment. net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2021, consisted primarily of purchases of investments, net of proceeds from maturities and sales, of $2.10 billion and $340 million paid for the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment. net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2020, consisted of purchases of investments, net of proceeds from maturities and sales, of $561 million, $342 million paid for the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment, and $38 million paid for the orpheus medical acquisition, net of cash acquired. we invest predominantly in high quality, fixed income securities. our investment portfolio may, at any time, contain investments in u.s. treasury and u.s. government agency securities, taxable and tax-exempt municipal notes, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, non-u.s. government agency securities, cash deposits, and money market funds. financing activities net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2022, consisted primarily of cash used in the repurchase of approximately 11.2 million shares of our common stock for $2.61 billion, 8.5 million shares of which related to accelerated share buyback programs executed and settled during 2022 and further described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, and taxes paid on behalf of employees related to net share settlements of vested employee equity awards of $194 million, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $234 million. net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2021, consisted primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $277 million, partially offset by taxes paid on behalf of employees related to net share settlements of vested employee equity awards of $212 million, and the payment of deferred purchase consideration of $22 million. net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2020, consisted primarily of taxes paid on behalf of employees related to net share settlements of vested employee equity awards of $175 million, cash used in the repurchase of approximately 0.7 million shares of our common stock in the open market for $134 million, and the payment of deferred purchase consideration of $85 million, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $309 million. capital expenditures our capital expenditures are increasing as we continue to build the company to supply our customers with highly differentiated products manufactured in highly automated factories that facilitate outstanding performance in product quality, availability, and cost. a significant portion of this investment involves the construction of facilities to expand our manufacturing and commercial capabilities. we have also been vertically integrating key technologies to develop a more robust supply chain and bring important products to market at attractive price points. these investments include increased ownership of our imaging pipelines, investments in strategic instruments and accessories technologies, as well as the development of software and digital products that allow us to serve our customers better. we expect these capital investments to increase significantly in 2023 to a range between $800 million and $1 billion, over half of which will be facilities-related investments. we intend to fund these capital investments with cash generated from operations. contractual obligations and commercial commitments operating leases. we lease spaces for our operations in the u.s. as well as in japan, china, israel, mexico, germany, south korea, the united kingdom, and other countries. we also lease automobiles for certain sales and field service employees. these leases have varying terms of up to 20 years. operating lease amounts include future minimum lease payments under all of our non-cancellable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year. refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 for further details. purchase commitments and obligations. total purchase commitments and obligations as of december 31, 2022, are estimated to be $2.14 billion, of which $1.79 billion is expected to be due within a year. these amounts include an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, including commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for which we have not received the goods or services, commitments for capital expenditures, including construction-related activities, for which we have not received the goods or services, and commitments for the acquisition and licensing of intellectual property. more than one third of our estimated purchase commitments and obligations are facilities-related. although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, or adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or table of contents performance of services. in addition to the above, we have committed to making potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration, and development arrangements. payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory, and/or commercial milestones. for instances in which the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. 2017 tax act deemed repatriation tax. as of december 31, 2022, our obligation associated with the deemed repatriation tax is $161 million, of which $40 million is due within a year. amounts due are expected to be paid in installments in accordance with the 2017 tax act. we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when payments may occur for our unrecognized tax benefits. off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2022, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of regulation s-k promulgated under the exchange act. critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap, which requires us to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions. see \"note 2. summary of significant accounting policies,\" in notes to the consolidated financial statements, which is included in \"item 8. financial statements and supplementary data,\" for a description of our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. our most critical accounting estimates include: •the valuation and recognition of investments, which impacts our investment portfolio balance when we assess fair value and interest and other income, net, when we record impairments; •the standalone selling prices used to allocate the contract consideration to the individual performance obligations, which impacts revenue recognition; •the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross profit margins; •the valuation of and assessment of the recoverability of intangible assets and goodwill and the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, which primarily impacts gross profit margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their amortization; •the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes; and •the estimate of probable loss associated with legal contingencies, which impacts accrued liabilities and operating expenses. investments valuation fair value. our investments may include, at any time, a diversified portfolio of cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments in a variety of high-quality securities, including money market funds, u.s. treasury and u.s. government agency securities, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, non-u.s. government agency securities, and municipal notes, as well as equity investments with and without readily determinable value. the assessment of the fair value of investments can be difficult and subjective. gaap establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value. valuation of level 1 and 2 instruments generally do not require significant management judgment, and the estimation is not difficult. level 3 instruments include unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. the determination of fair value for level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity. there were no level 3 securities for the periods presented. after determining the fair value of our available-for-sale instruments, we identify instruments with an amortized cost basis in excess of their estimated fair value. available-for-sale instruments in an unrealized loss position are written down to fair value through a charge to interest and other income, net in the consolidated statements of income, if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. for the remaining securities, we assess what amount of the excess, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. factors considered in determining whether a credit-related loss exists include the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, the extent of the loss related to the credit of the issuer, and the expected cash flows from the security. these judgments could prove to be wrong, and companies with relatively high credit ratings and solid financial conditions may not be able to fulfill their obligations. table of contents no significant impairment charges were recorded during the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. as of december 31, 2022, and 2021, net unrealized losses on investments of $154.2 million and $16.0 million, net of tax, respectively, were included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. revenue recognition. our system sale arrangements contain multiple products and services, including system(s), system components, system accessories, instruments, accessories, and services. other than services, we generally deliver all of the products upfront. each of these products and services is a distinct performance obligation. system accessories, instruments, accessories, and services are also sold on a standalone basis. for multiple-element arrangements, revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. standalone selling prices are based on observable prices at which we separately sell the products or services. if a standalone selling price is not directly observable, then we estimate the standalone selling prices considering market conditions and entity-specific factors including, but not limited to, features and functionality of the products and services, geographies, type of customer, and market conditions. we regularly review standalone selling prices and maintain internal controls over establishing and updating these estimates. our system sales arrangements generally include a five-year period of service. the first year of service is generally free and included in the system sale arrangement, and the remaining four years are billed at a stated service price. revenue that is allocated to the service obligation is deferred and recognized ratably over the service period. inventory valuation. inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first-in, first-out basis. the cost basis of our inventory is reduced for any products that are considered excess or obsolete based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. valuation of intangible assets and goodwill. we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration, including contingent consideration, to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest is recorded as goodwill. when determining the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest, management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. the estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows, and the determination of the assets' life cycle. these estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. our intangible assets include identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. identifiable intangible assets include developed technology, patents, distribution rights, customer relationships, licenses, and non-competition arrangements. currently, all of our identifiable intangible assets have finite lives. goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to an annual impairment review (or more frequent if impairment indicators arise) by applying a fair value-based test. there have been no such impairments. identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are subject to impairment testing and are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of these identifiable intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from such assets. if the cash flow estimates or the significant operating assumptions upon which they are based change in the future, we may be required to record additional impairment charges. the valuation and classification of intangible assets and goodwill and the assignment of useful lives for purposes of amortization involves judgments and the use of estimates. the evaluation of these intangible assets and goodwill for impairment under established accounting principles is required on a recurring basis. changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to the assumptions made. when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of amortization over the assets' new, shorter useful lives. no impairment charges or accelerated amortization were recorded for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing impairment, which includes financial forecasts. if conditions are different from management's current estimates, material write-downs of long-lived assets may be required, which would adversely affect our operating results. accounting for income taxes. significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in accordance with gaap. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and table of contents financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease in our tax provision in the current period or subsequent periods. also, we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. in the event that all or part of our deferred tax assets are not recoverable in the future, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be recoverable. in order for our deferred tax assets to be recoverable, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. we consider forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, in determining the need for a valuation allowance. as of december 31, 2022, we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will ultimately be recovered, with the exception of our california deferred tax assets. we believe that, due to the computation of california taxes under the single sales factor, it is more likely than not that our california deferred tax assets will not be realized. should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would be affected in the period in which such change takes place. the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, then the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. we re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effective settlement of audit issues, and new audit activity. such a change in the recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. accounting for legal contingencies. from time to time, we are involved in a number of legal proceedings involving product liability, intellectual property, shareholder derivative actions, securities class actions, insurance, employee-related, and other matters. we record a liability and related charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements for legal contingencies when the loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. our assessment is re-evaluated each accounting period and is based on all available information, including discussion with any outside legal counsel that represents us. if a reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss cannot be made, but a range of probable losses can be estimated, the low-end of the range of losses is recognized if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other. if a loss is reasonably possible, but not probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. when determining the estimated probable loss or range of losses, significant judgment is required to be exercised in order to estimate the amount and timing of the loss to be recorded. estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation are inherently difficult to make, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages with incomplete facts and information. the final outcome of legal proceedings is dependent on many variables and is difficult to predict and, therefore, the ultimate cost to entirely resolve such matters may be materially different than the amount of current estimates. consequently, new information or changes in judgments and estimates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations or cash flows. recent accounting pronouncements see \"note 2. summary of significant accounting policies\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements in \"item 8. financial statements and supplementary data\" for additional information regarding recent accounting pronouncements, including the

organizational resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” (vogus & sutcliffe, 2007: 3418). organizational resilience is defined as the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity. resilience can be defined as the system’s ability to maintain its integrity and its performance, at least partially, while under internal or external variations and disturbances (i.e. pressures, constraints, failures, errors, violations, hazards), whether nominal, extreme, or exceptional. defined as a company’s ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from a challenging situation. we develop a trajectory model of organizational resilience that focuses on how actors project temporal trajectories of responses toward disruptive events, reconstitute the trajectories in immediate response to the event, and reconfigure the trajectories toward the ensuing future. the concept of resilience draws attention to systems as well as individuals, to partial maintenance of integrity and performance, to the opposite of brittleness, and to disturbances that vary both in scale and source. resilience is a multifaceted concept that reflects businesses’ ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change to survive, grow, and flourish.\"\"\"\n\n    Text:\n    \"\"\"item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of kkr & co. inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. in addition, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described under \"cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements\" and \"risk factors.\" actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. business environment economic and market conditions our asset management and insurance businesses are materially affected by the economic conditions of, and financial markets in, the united states, the eu, china, japan, and other countries. global and regional economic conditions can each have substantial impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations in various ways, including the valuations of our investments, our ability to exit these investments profitably, our ability to raise capital from investors, and our ability to make new investments. economic conditions during the year ended december 31, 2022, the global economy continued to recover from the impact of the covid-19 pandemic; however, many countries and regions, including the united states, showed signs of slowing economic activity, potentially indicating the early stages of a recession. economic activity began to be adversely impacted by the effects of monetary and fiscal policy tightening as years of fiscal stimulus from governments and accommodative monetary policy from global central banks began to wane as central banks took measures to combat significant inflationary pressures at multi-decade highs in many major economies around the world. inflation presented a headwind for many country and regional economies in which we operate. the federal reserve board has continued to raise interest rates and has indicated that it is prepared to take decisive action to manage inflation, including raising interest rates further and shrinking the size of its balance sheet. as a result of these and other actions by central banks, overall macro conditions began to transition by the fourth quarter of 2022 with less focus on inflation's impact on repricing capital markets and moving towards a period where high rates and inflation began to put significant pressure on corporate profits and consumer balance sheets. by year-end 2022, inflation began to show signs of peaking on a year-over-year basis in the u.s. and in certain other regions, but remained elevated in absolute terms. higher interest rates in conjunction with slower growth or weaker currencies in some emerging market economies have caused, and may further cause, the default risk of these countries to increase, and this could impact the operations or value of our investments that operate in these regions. areas that have central bank quantitative easing or tightening campaigns affecting their interest rates relative to the united states could potentially experience further currency volatility relative to the u.s. dollar. relatedly, foreign exchange rates are often affected by countries' monetary and fiscal responses to inflationary trends. foreign exchange rates have a substantial impact on the valuations of our investments that are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. currency volatility can also affect our businesses and investments that deal in cross-border trade. labor disputes, shortages of material and skilled labor, work stoppages and increasing labor costs can also adversely impact us and the assets we manage. despite various economic headwinds, several key economic indicators in the u.s., including employment have demonstrated resilience in 2022. during 2022, the growth in economic activity and demand for goods and services, alongside supply chain complications, contributed to these significant inflationary pressures. various supply bottlenecks ranging from dynamic zero-covid policy to shifting russia-ukraine supply chains to u.s. domestic semiconductor industry output shortages as a result of restrictions on trade with chinese semiconductor companies contributed to inflationary pressure throughout much of 2022. in the united states and many other countries, laws designed to protect national security or to restrict foreign direct investment continued to proliferate in 2022, which adversely affected the business and investment environments in various ways. these and related concerns, such as rising interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty in countries such as china, russia, belarus and the ukraine, contributed to substantial market volatility, equity and credit market declines and increased pressures on labor supply. in the eurozone, disruptions to european energy markets and russia's ongoing invasion of ukraine adversely affected the business environment. the russia-ukraine conflict, including the sanctions imposed in response to russia's invasion of ukraine, have exacerbated and may further exacerbate these issues and trends globally, including by increasing oil and gas prices and price volatility. protectionist policies, such as restrictions on exports of food, have also increased globally as a result of russia's invasion of ukraine. as of december 31, 2022, we have no investments in any portfolio companies whose executive table of contents headquarters are located in russia, ukraine or belarus, and we believe that the direct exposure of our investment portfolio to russia, ukraine and belarus is insignificant. in addition, the chinese economy experienced headwinds related to the ongoing slowdown in china's property sector and the effects of the government's zero-covid policies. in japan, the economic recovery from covid-19 continued, despite higher energy costs and significant volatility in currency markets. several relevant key economic indicators in the u.s. and in other countries and areas in which our business operates include: •inflation. the u.s. core consumer price index rose 5.7% on a year-over-year basis as of december 31, 2022, up from 5.5% on a year-over-year basis as of december 31, 2021. core inflation in china was 0.7% on a year-over-year basis as of december 31, 2022, down from 1.2% on a year-over-year basis as of december 31, 2021. in japan, core inflation rose to 1.6% on a year-over-year basis as of december 31, 2022, up from -1.3% on a year-over-year basis as of december 31, 2021. euro area core inflation was 5.2% as of december 31, 2022, up from 2.6% as of december 31, 2021. •interest rates. the effective federal funds rate set by the federal reserve board was 4.33% as of december 31, 2022, up from 0.1% as of december 31, 2021. the federal reserve raised interest rates by 75 basis points in november, and 50 basis points in december, leading to increased market volatility. the short-term benchmark interest rate set by the bank of japan was -0.1% as of december 31, 2022, unchanged from december 31, 2021. the short-term benchmark interest rate set by the european central bank was 2.5% as of december 31, 2022, up from 0.0% as of december 31, 2021. •gdp. in the united states, real gdp is estimated to have expanded by 2.1% for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to an expansion of 5.9% for the year ended december 31, 2021. real gdp in china is estimated to have increased by 3.0% for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to growth of 8.4% reported for the year ended december 31, 2021. in japan, real gdp growth for the year ended december 31, 2022, is estimated to have been 1.3%, down from 2.3% for the year ended december 31, 2021. euro area real gdp growth was 3.2% as of december 31, 2022, up from 5.3% as of december 31, 2021. •unemployment. the u.s. unemployment rate was 3.5% as of december 31, 2022, down from 3.9% as of december 31, 2021. the unemployment rate in china was 5.5% as of december 31, 2022, up from 5.1% as of december 31, 2021. the unemployment rate in japan was 2.5% as of december 31, 2022, down from 2.7% as of december 31, 2021. in addition, euro area unemployment was 6.5% as of december 31, 2022, up from 7.0% as of december 31, 2021. market conditions equity, credit, commodity and foreign exchange markets in the united states and in other countries and areas in which we have made investments each can have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. in our asset management segment, many of our investments are in equities, so a change in global equity prices or in market volatility directly impacts the value of our investments and our profitability as well as our ability to realize investment gains and the receptiveness of fund investors to our investment products. volatility across global equity and credit markets, alongside shifting liquidity conditions in new issue activity across equity and non-investment grade credit markets, have adversely impacted (and may continue to adversely impact) our financial results and the volume of capital markets activity, the level of transaction fees that our capital markets business line is able to earn, the valuation of our portfolio companies, the investment income that we recognize and our ability to deploy our, and our funds', capital. for our investments that are publicly listed and thus have readily observable market prices, global equity market price declines had (and may continue to have) a direct impact on valuation. for many other of our investments, these markets had an indirect materially adverse impact on many of our investment valuations as we typically utilize market multiples as a critical input to ascertain fair value of our investments that do not have readily observable market prices. in addition, many of our investments are in non-investment grade credit instruments and investment grade credit instruments. many of our funds invest or have the flexibility to invest a significant portion of their assets in the equity, debt, loans or other securities of issuers that are based outside of the united states. a substantial amount of these investments consist of private equity investments made by our private equity funds. for example, as of december 31, 2022, approximately 50% of the capital invested in those funds was attributable to non-u.s. investments. in our insurance business, a change in equity prices also impacts global atlantic's equity-sensitive annuity and life insurance products, including with respect to hedging costs related to and fee-income earned on those products. our funds, our portfolio companies and global atlantic also rely on credit financing and the ability to refinance existing debt. consequently, any decrease in the value of credit instruments that we have table of contents invested in or any increase in the cost of credit financing reduces our returns and decreases our net income. tightening liquidity conditions in equity and credit capital markets affect the availability and cost of capital for us and our portfolio companies, and the increased cost of credit or degradation in debt financing terms may impact our ability to identify and execute investments on attractive terms. in our insurance segment, periods of rising or higher interest rates as we are currently experiencing may result in differing impacts on global atlantic's business. periods of rising or higher interest rates can benefit global atlantic's results of operations and financial condition, as we generally expect the yield on new investment purchases and income from any floating rate investments held in global atlantic's investment portfolio to increase as interest rates rise. higher interest rates also generally tend to increase the demand for certain of global atlantic's products, as the benefits and solutions global atlantic can offer to clients may become more attractive, potentially resulting in higher new business volumes. rising rates are also expected to result in decreases to certain policy liabilities as a result of new accounting guidance which we adopted effective january 1, 2023 (with a transition date of january 1, 2021) for insurance companies that issue or reinsure long-duration contracts such as life insurance and annuities. for a further discussion of this guidance, see note 2 \"summary of significant accounting policies-future application of accounting standards\" in our financial statements. higher interest rates can also have a negative impact on global atlantic. for example, higher policyholder surrenders may occur in response to rising interest rates as more attractive products become available to policyholders in a higher rate environment. the majority of our investments at global atlantic are in investment grade credit instruments. sales of those investments at a loss, for example to raise cash to meet policyholder obligations upon surrender earlier than expected maturity or as we rotate out of investments acquired with new reinsurance transactions to our desired asset mix during a period of rising or higher rates compared to when the investment was acquired, is expected to decrease our net income in that period and such decrease could be significant. we also expect that in a higher rate environment we will generally have a higher cost of insurance on new business, including higher hedging costs, as the benefits to policyholders on new business will be generally higher. if global atlantic fails to adequately cash flow match liabilities sold with higher benefits and interest rates fall while global atlantic holds that liability, global atlantic may not generate its expected earnings on those liabilities. in addition, rising interest rates will decrease the fair value of global atlantic's credit investments and the value of embedded derivatives associated with funds withheld reinsurance transactions. global atlantic expects that substantially all of its unrealized losses will not be realized as it intends to hold these investments until recovery of the losses, which may be at maturity, as part of its asset liability cash-flow matching strategy. however, if the market, industry and company-specific factors relating to these investments deteriorate meaningfully, global atlantic may be required to recognize an impairment to goodwill and may realize losses as a result of credit defaults or impairments on investments, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, commodity prices are generally expected to rise in inflationary environments. our real assets business line portfolio contains energy real asset investments, and certain of our other private equity, real assets and credit and liquid strategies business line strategies have investments in or related to the energy sector. the value of these investments is heavily influenced by the price of natural gas and oil. as noted above, the actions taken by russia in the ukraine starting in february 2022 have caused volatility in the commodities markets. to the extent energy real asset investments are directly held by our balance sheet, price movements can have an amplified impact on our financial results, as we directly bear the full extent of such gains or losses, subject to hedging. although the recent bankruptcies and financial distress among crypto asset market participants and the resulting price volatility of crypto assets have caused widespread disruption in those markets, as of december 31, 2022, these events have had no material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. neither we through our balance sheet, nor the limited partner funds we manage, have material direct exposure to crypto asset market participants that we are aware of that have: commenced insolvency, receivership, reorganization or bankruptcy proceedings; experienced excessive redemptions or suspended redemptions or withdrawals of crypto assets; the crypto assets of their customers unaccounted for; or experienced material corporate compliance failures. while, to date, our business has only minimal crypto exposure, the level of exposure may shift over time, and we cannot predict the broader impact, including to us, of the recent bankruptcies and financial distress among crypto asset market participants and coverage of new regulatory developments related to crypto assets and crypto asset markets. several relevant key market indicators in the u.s. and in other countries and areas which constitute our business environment include: •equity markets. for the year ended december 31, 2022, global equity markets were negative, with the s&p 500 down 18.1% and the msci world index down 17.7% on a total return basis including dividends. equity market volatility as evidenced by the chicago board options exchange market volatility index (vix), a measure of volatility, ended at 21.7 as of december 31, 2022, increasing from 17.2 as of december 31, 2021. •credit markets. during the year ended december 31, 2022, u.s. investment grade corporate bond spreads (bofa merrill lynch us corporate index) widened by 40 basis points and u.s. high-yield corporate bond spreads (bofaml hy master ii index) widened by 171 basis points. the non-investment grade credit indices were down during the year ended december 31, 2022, with the s&p/lsta leveraged loan index down 0.6% and the baml us high yield index down 11.2%. during the year ended december 31, 2022, 10-year government bond yields rose 236 basis points in the united states, rose 6 basis points in china, rose 35 basis points in japan, rose 270 basis points in the uk and rose 275 basis points in germany. •commodity markets. during the year ended december 31, 2022, the 3-year forward price of wti crude oil increased approximately 11.3%, and the 3-year forward price of natural gas increased from approximately $3.43 per mmbtu to $4.99 per mmbtu as of december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2022. the japan spot lng import price decreased to approximately $28.46 per mmbtu as of december 31, 2022 from approximately $31.26 per mmbtu as of december 31, 2021. •foreign exchange rates. for the year ended december 31, 2022, the euro fell 5.8%, the british pound 10.7%, the japanese yen 12.2%, and the chinese renminbi fell 7.9%, respectively, relative to the u.s. dollar. other trends, uncertainties and risks related to our business please refer to the \"risk factors\" section of this report for important additional detail regarding the known trends or uncertainties and competitive conditions that have had or that are reasonably likely to have a material favorable or unfavorable impact on our businesses, including the impact of economic and market conditions on valuations of investments. these known trends, uncertainties and competitive conditions should be read in conjunction with this business environment section and the entire risk factor section. basis of accounting and key financial measures under gaap we manage our business using certain financial measures and key operating metrics since we believe these metrics measure the productivity of our investment activities. we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (\"gaap\"). see note 2 \" summary of significant accounting policies\" in our financial statements and \"critical accounting policies and estimates\" contained in this section below. our key segment and non-gaap financial measures and operating metrics are discussed below. key segment and non-gaap performance measures the following key segment and non-gaap performance measures are used by management in making operational and resource deployment decisions as well as assessing the performance of kkr's business. they include certain financial measures that are calculated and presented using methodologies other than in accordance with gaap. these performance measures as described below are presented prior to giving effect to the allocation of income (loss) between kkr & co. inc. and holders of exchangeable securities and as such represent the entire kkr business in total. in addition, these performance measures are presented without giving effect to the consolidation of the investment funds and collateralized financing entities (\"cfes\") that kkr manages. we believe that providing these segment and non-gaap performance measures on a supplemental basis to our gaap results is helpful to stockholders in assessing the overall performance of kkr's business. these non-gaap measures should not be considered as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap. reconciliations of these non-gaap measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, where applicable are included under \"-analysis of non-gaap performance measures-reconciliations to gaap measures.\" after-tax distributable earnings after-tax distributable earnings is a non-gaap performance measure of kkr's earnings, which is derived from kkr's reported segment results. after-tax distributable earnings is used to assess the performance of kkr's business operations and measures the earnings potentially available for distribution to its equity holders or reinvestment into its business. after-tax distributable earnings is equal to distributable operating earnings less interest expense, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and income taxes paid. series c mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends have been excluded from after-tax distributable earnings, because the definition of adjusted shares used to calculate after-tax distributable earnings per adjusted share assumes that all shares of series c mandatory convertible preferred stock have been converted to shares of common stock of kkr & co. inc. income taxes paid represents the amount of income taxes that table of contents would be paid assuming that all pre-tax distributable earnings were allocated to kkr & co. inc. and taxed at the same effective rate, which assumes that all securities exchangeable into shares of common stock of kkr & co. inc. were exchanged. income taxes paid includes the benefit of tax deductions arising from equity-based compensation, which reduces income taxes paid or payable during the period. equity based compensation expense is excluded from after-tax distributable earnings, because (i) kkr believes that the cost of equity awards granted to employees does not contribute to the earnings potentially available for distributions to its equity holders or reinvestment into its business and (ii) excluding this expense makes kkr's reporting metric more comparable to the corresponding metric presented by other publicly traded companies in kkr's industry, which kkr believes enhances an investor's ability to compare kkr's performance to these other companies. if tax deductions from equity-based compensation were to be excluded from income taxes paid, kkr's after-tax distributable earnings would be lower and kkr's effective tax rate would appear to be higher, even though a lower amount of income taxes would have actually been paid or payable during the period. kkr separately discloses the amount of tax deduction from equity-based compensation for the period reported and the effect of its inclusion in after-tax distributable earnings for the period. kkr makes these adjustments when calculating after-tax distributable earnings in order to more accurately reflect the net realized earnings that are expected to be or become available for distribution to kkr's equity holders or reinvestment into kkr's business. however, after-tax distributable earnings does not represent and is not used to calculate actual dividends under kkr's dividend policy, which is a fixed amount per period, and after-tax distributable earnings should not be viewed as a measure of kkr's liquidity. book value book value is a non-gaap performance measure of the net assets of kkr and is used by management primarily in assessing the unrealized value of kkr's net assets presented on a basis that (i) deconsolidates kkr's investment funds and cfes that kkr manages, (ii) includes the net assets that are attributable to certain securities exchangeable into shares of common stock of kkr & co. inc., and (iii) includes kkr's ownership of the net assets of global atlantic. we believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the net assets of kkr excluding those net assets that are allocated to investors in kkr's investment funds and other noncontrolling interest holders. kkr's book value includes the net impact of kkr's tax assets and liabilities as calculated under gaap. series c mandatory convertible preferred stock has been included in book value, because the definition of adjusted shares used to calculate book value per adjusted share assumes that all shares of series c mandatory convertible preferred stock have been converted to shares of common stock of kkr & co. inc. to calculate global atlantic book value and to make it more comparable with the corresponding metric presented by other publicly traded companies in global atlantic's industry, global atlantic book value excludes (i) accumulated other comprehensive income and (ii) accumulated change in fair value of reinsurance balances and related assets, net of deferred acquisition costs and income tax. distributable operating earnings distributable operating earnings is a non-gaap performance measure that kkr believes is useful to stockholders as it provides a supplemental measure of our operating performance without taking into account items that kkr does not believe arise from or relate directly to kkr's operations. distributable operating earnings excludes: (i) equity-based compensation charges, (ii) amortization of acquired intangibles, (iii) strategic corporate transaction-related charges and (iv) non-recurring items, if any. strategic corporate transaction-related items arise from corporate actions and consist primarily of (i) impairments, (ii) non-monetary gains or losses on divestitures, (iii) transaction costs from strategic acquisitions, and (iv) depreciation on real estate that kkr owns and occupies. inter-segment transactions are not eliminated from segment results when management considers those transactions in assessing the results of the respective segments. these transactions include (i) management fees earned by kkr as the investment adviser for global atlantic insurance companies and (ii) interest income and expense based on lending arrangements where one or more kkr subsidiaries borrow from a global atlantic insurance subsidiary. inter-segment transactions are recorded by each segment based on the definitive documents that contain arms' length terms and comply with applicable regulatory requirements. distributable operating earnings represents operating earnings of kkr's asset management and insurance segments, which are comprised of the following: •asset management segment operating earnings is the segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and to assess the performance of the asset management segment and is comprised of: (i) fee related earnings, (ii) realized performance income, (iii) realized performance income compensation, (iv) realized investment income, and (v) realized investment income compensation. asset management segment operating earnings excludes the impact of: (i) unrealized carried interest, (ii) net unrealized gains (losses) on investments, and (iii) related unrealized carried interest compensation. management fees earned by kkr as the adviser, manager or sponsor for its investment funds, vehicles and accounts, including global atlantic insurance companies, are included in asset management segment operating earnings. •insurance segment operating earnings is the segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and to assess the performance of the insurance segment and is comprised of: (i) net investment income, (ii) net cost of insurance, (iii) general, administrative, and other expenses, (iv) income taxes, and (v) net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. the non-operating adjustments made to derive insurance segment operating earnings exclude the impact of: (i) realized (gains) losses related to asset/liability matching investments strategies, (ii) unrealized investment (gains) losses, (iii) changes in the fair value of derivatives, embedded derivatives, and fair value liabilities for fixed-indexed annuities, indexed universal life contracts and variable annuities, and (iv) the associated income tax effects of all exclusions from insurance segment operating earnings except for equity-based compensation expense. insurance segment operating earnings includes (i) realized gains and losses not related to asset/liability matching investments strategies and (ii) the investment management fee expenses that are earned by kkr as the investment adviser of the global atlantic insurance companies. fee related earnings fee related earnings is a performance measure used to assess the asset management segment's generation of profits from revenues that are measured and received on a recurring basis and are not dependent on future realization events. kkr believes this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the profitability of kkr's fee generating asset management and capital markets businesses and other recurring revenue streams. fre equals (i) management fees, including fees paid by the insurance segment to the asset management segment and fees paid by certain insurance co-investment vehicles, (ii) transaction and monitoring fees, net and (iii) fee related performance revenues, less (x) fee related compensation, and (y) other operating expenses. •fee related performance revenues refers to the realized portion of incentive fees from certain aum that has an indefinite term and for which there is no immediate requirement to return invested capital to investors upon the realization of investments. fee-related performance revenues consists of performance fees (i) to be received from our investment funds, vehicles and accounts on a recurring basis, and (ii) that are not dependent on a realization event involving investments held by the investment fund, vehicle or account. •fee related compensation refers to the compensation expense, excluding equity-based compensation, paid from (i) management fees, (ii) transaction and monitoring fees, net, and (iii) fee related performance revenues. •other operating expenses represents the sum of (i) occupancy and related charges and (ii) other operating expenses. total asset management segment revenues total asset management segment revenues is a performance measure that represents the realized revenues of the asset management segment (which excludes unrealized carried interest and unrealized net gains (losses) on investments) and is the sum of (i) management fees, (ii) transaction and monitoring fees, net, (iii) fee related performance revenues, (iv) realized performance income, and (v) realized investment income. kkr believes that this performance measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the realized revenues generated by kkr's asset management segment. other terms and capital metrics adjusted shares adjusted shares represents shares of common stock of kkr & co. inc. outstanding under gaap adjusted to include (i) the number of shares of common stock of kkr & co. inc. assumed to be issuable upon conversion of the series c mandatory convertible preferred stock and (ii) certain securities exchangeable into shares of common stock of kkr & co. inc. weighted average adjusted shares is used in the calculation of after-tax distributable earnings per adjusted share, and adjusted shares is used in the calculation of book value per adjusted share. assets under management assets under management represent the assets managed, advised or sponsored by kkr from which kkr is entitled to receive management fees or performance income (currently or upon a future event), general partner capital, and assets managed, advised or sponsored by our strategic bdc partnership and the hedge fund and other managers in which kkr holds an ownership interest. we believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the capital raising activities of kkr and its hedge fund and other managers and the overall activity in their investment funds and other managed or sponsored capital. kkr calculates the amount of aum as of any date as the sum of: (i) the fair value of the investments of kkr's investment funds and certain co-investment vehicles; (ii) uncalled capital commitments from these funds, including table of contents uncalled capital commitments from which kkr is currently not earning management fees or performance income; (iii) the asset value of the global atlantic insurance companies; (iv) the par value of outstanding clos; (v) kkr's pro rata portion of the aum of hedge fund and other managers in which kkr holds an ownership interest; (vi) all of the aum of kkr's strategic bdc partnership; (vii) the acquisition cost of invested assets of certain non-u.s. real estate investment trusts; and (viii) the value of other assets managed or sponsored by kkr. the pro rata portion of the aum of hedge fund and other managers is calculated based on kkr's percentage ownership interest in such entities multiplied by such entity's respective aum. kkr's definition of aum (i) is not based on any definition of aum that may be set forth in the governing documents of the investment funds, vehicles, accounts or other entities whose capital is included in this definition, (ii) includes assets for which kkr does not act as an investment adviser, and (iii) is not calculated pursuant to any regulatory definitions. capital invested capital invested is the aggregate amount of capital invested by (i) kkr's investment funds and global atlantic insurance companies, (ii) kkr's principal activities business line as a co-investment, if any, alongside kkr's investment funds, and (iii) kkr's principal activities business line in connection with a syndication transaction conducted by kkr's capital markets business line, if any. capital invested is used as a measure of investment activity at kkr during a given period. we believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides a measure of capital deployment across kkr's business lines. capital invested includes investments made using investment financing arrangements like credit facilities, as applicable. capital invested excludes (i) investments in certain leveraged credit strategies, (ii) capital invested by kkr's principal activities business line that is not a co-investment alongside kkr's investment funds, and (iii) capital invested by kkr's principal activities business line that is not invested in connection with a syndication transaction by kkr's capital markets business line. capital syndicated by kkr's capital markets business line to third parties other than kkr's investment funds or principal activities business line is not included in capital invested. fee paying aum fee paying aum represents only the aum from which kkr is entitled to receive management fees. we believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the capital base upon which kkr earns management fees. fpaum is the sum of all of the individual fee bases that are used to calculate kkr's and its hedge fund and bdc partnership management fees and differs from aum in the following respects: (i) assets and commitments from which kkr is not entitled to receive a management fee are excluded (e.g., assets and commitments with respect to which it is entitled to receive only performance income or is otherwise not currently entitled to receive a management fee) and (ii) certain assets, primarily in its private equity funds, are reflected based on capital commitments and invested capital as opposed to fair value because fees are not impacted by changes in the fair value of underlying investments. uncalled commitments uncalled commitments is the aggregate amount of unfunded capital commitments that kkr's investment funds and carry-paying co-investment vehicles have received from partners to contribute capital to fund future investments. the amount of uncalled commitments is not reduced by capital invested using borrowings under an investment fund's subscription facility until capital is called from our fund investors. we believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the amount of capital that is available to kkr's investment funds and carry paying co-investment vehicles to make future investments. uncalled commitments are not reduced for investments completed using fund-level investment financing arrangements or investments we have committed to make but remain unfunded at the reporting date. table of contents consolidated

asset management $321,118 $9,692,568 $(9,371,450) fees and other total fees and other for the year ended december 31, 2022 decreased compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily as a result of a lower level of transaction fees, which was partially offset by an increase in management fees. for a more detailed discussion of the factors that affected our transaction fees during the period, see \"-analysis of asset management segment operating earnings.\" the increase in management fees was primarily attributable to management fees earned from north america fund xiii, global infrastructure investors iv and european fund vi. this increase was partially offset by a decrease in management fees earned from european fund v and americas fund xii as a result of entering their post-investment periods and, consequently, we now earn fees based on capital invested rather than capital committed and at a lower fee rate. management fees due from consolidated investment funds and other vehicles are eliminated upon consolidation under gaap. however, because these amounts are funded by, and earned from, noncontrolling interests, upon consolidation under gaap, kkr's allocated share of the net income from the consolidated investment funds and other vehicles is increased by the amount of fees that are eliminated. accordingly, net income (loss) attributable to kkr would be unchanged if such investment funds and other vehicles were not consolidated. for a more detailed discussion on the factors that affect our management fees during the period, see \"-analysis of asset management segment operating earnings.\" fee credits increased compared to the prior period as a result of a higher level of transaction fees from infrastructure transaction fee-generating investments in our real asset business line. fee credits owed to consolidated investment funds are eliminated upon consolidation under gaap. however, because these amounts are owed to noncontrolling interests, upon consolidation under gaap, kkr's allocated share of the net income from the consolidated investment funds is decreased by the amount of fee credits that are eliminated. accordingly, net income (loss) attributable to kkr would be unchanged if such investment funds and other vehicles were not consolidated. transaction and monitoring fees earned from kkr portfolio companies are not eliminated upon consolidation because those fees are earned from companies which are not consolidated. furthermore, transaction fees earned in our capital markets business are not shared with fund investors. accordingly, certain transaction fees are reflected in our revenues without a corresponding fee credit. table of contents capital allocation-based income (loss) capital allocation-based income (loss) for the year ended december 31, 2022 was negative primarily due to the net depreciation of the underlying investments in many of our carry-earning investment funds, most notably americas fund xii, asian fund ii, and asian fund iii. capital allocation-based income (loss) for the year ended december 31, 2021 was positive primarily due to the net appreciation of the underlying investments at our carry earning investment funds, most notably americas fund xii, asian fund iii, and north america fund xi. kkr calculates the carried interest that would be due to kkr for each investment fund, pursuant to the fund agreements, as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of the reporting date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. since the fair value of the underlying investments varies between reporting periods, it is necessary to make adjustments to the amounts recorded as carried interest to reflect either (a) positive performance, resulting in an increase in the carried interest allocated to the general partner or (b) negative performance that would cause the amount due to kkr to be less than the amount previously recognized, resulting in a negative adjustment to carried interest allocated to the general partner. in each case, it is necessary to calculate the carried interest on cumulative results compared to the carried interest recorded to date and to make the required positive or negative adjustments. investment income (loss) - asset management net gains (losses) from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2022 the net losses from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2022 were comprised of net realized gains of $1,298.5 million and net unrealized losses of $(2,964.0) million. investment gains and losses relating to our general partner capital interest in our unconsolidated funds are not reflected in our discussion and analysis of net gains (losses) from investment activities. our economics associated with these gains and losses are reflected in capital allocation-based income (loss) as described above. realized gains and losses from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2022, net realized gains related primarily to (i) the sale of our investment in fiserv, inc. (nasdaq: fisv), which was a significant contributor to gains from investment activities in 2022 but has now been completely sold and will no longer contribute to gains from investment activities, (ii) realizations on certain foreign exchange forward contracts, and (iii) the sale of real estate investments held in certain consolidated opportunistic real estate equity funds. partially offsetting these realized gains were realized losses primarily relating to (i) various investments held in our consolidated alternative credit funds, (ii) a realized loss on magneti marelli ck holdings (industrials sector) held in certain consolidated funds and (iii) realized losses from the sales of revolving credit facilities. unrealized gains and losses from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2022, net unrealized losses were driven primarily by mark-to-market losses from (i) investments held in our consolidated clos and in certain consolidated alternative credit funds, (ii) outsystems holdings s.a. (technology sector) held in certain consolidated funds and (iii) the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains relating to the realization activity described above. these unrealized losses were partially offset by mark-to-market gains related to (i) investments held in certain consolidated energy funds, (ii) usi, inc. (financial services sector), and (iii) erm worldwide group limited (services sector). the extent and the factors that affect each investment strategy vary depending on the nature of the asset class and the valuation methodology employed. for the year ended december 31, 2022 net unrealized losses were primarily generated in the following asset classes: •private equity (excluding core private equity), which was primarily impacted by (i) the negative returns of global equity markets and the related reduction of market multiples used in the market comparables methodology for the valuation of level iii investments, and (ii) the negative impact of higher interest rates and a higher market risk premium in 2022 on discount rates used in the discounted cash flow methodology for the valuation of level iii investments; •credit, which were primarily impacted by the widening of the credit spreads observed in the credit markets in 2022; and table of contents •real estate, which, notwithstanding the positive operating performance of certain properties, was negatively impacted by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains relating to the realization activity described above and the capitalization rates widening in the fourth quarter of 2022. partially offsetting the losses in the asset classes above, there were the unrealized gains generated in the following asset classes: •infrastructure and energy, which benefited from (i) higher oil and gas prices and (ii) the positive operating performance of certain infrastructure assets; and •core private equity, which benefited from the positive operating performance of its portfolio companies. for a discussion of other factors that affected kkr's realized investment income, see \"-analysis of asset management segment operating results\". net gains (losses) from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2021 the net gains from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2021 were comprised of net realized gains of $2,382.2 million and net unrealized gains of $5,338.7 million. realized gains and losses from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2021, net realized gains related primarily to the sales of investments held by kkr and certain consolidated funds, the most significant of which were in fanduel inc. (technology sector), mr. cooper group inc. (nasdaq: coop), and darktrace limited (lse: dark). partially offsetting these realized gains were realized losses, the most significant of which were realized losses from various investments held in our consolidated credit funds and realized losses on certain hedging instruments. unrealized gains and losses from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2021, net unrealized gains related primarily to mark-to-market gains from investments held by kkr and certain consolidated funds, the most significant of which were petvet care centers, llc (health care sector), heartland dental llc (health care sector) and outsystems holdings s.a. partially offsetting these unrealized gains were unrealized losses, the most significant of which were (i) the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains relating to the realization activity described above and (ii) an unrealized loss on bridgebio pharma, inc. (nasdaq: bbio). for a discussion of other factors that affected kkr's realized investment income, see \"-analysis of asset management segment operating results\". for additional information about net gains (losses) from investment activities, see note 5 \"net gains (losses) from investment activities - asset management\" in our financial statements. dividend income during the year ended december 31, 2022, the most significant dividends received included (i) $441.2 million from investments held in our consolidated core plus and opportunistic real estate equity funds and (ii) $86.6 million from our investment in exact group b.v. (technology sector) held in our consolidated core vehicles. during the year ended december 31, 2021, the most significant dividends received included (i) $215.5 million from our consolidated real estate funds, (ii) $138.7 million from our investment in viridor limited (infrastructure: energy and energy transition sector), and (iii) $70.9 million from our investment in arnott's biscuits limited (consumer products sector). significant dividends from portfolio companies and consolidated funds are generally not recurring quarterly dividends, and while they may occur in the future, their size and frequency are variable. for a discussion of other factors that affected kkr's dividend income, see \"-analysis of asset management segment operating results.\" interest income the increase in interest income during the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 was primarily due to the (i) impact of closing additional clos that were consolidated during 2022 and higher interest rates on assets held in consolidated clos and (ii) a higher level of interest income from investments held in certain of our consolidated alternative credit funds, primarily related to an increase in the amount of capital deployed and higher interest rates. partially offsetting these increases was the deconsolidation of kref in the fourth quarter of 2021. for a discussion of other factors that affected kkr's interest income, see \"-analysis of asset management segment operating results.\" table of contents interest expense the increase in interest expense during the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 was primarily due to (i) an increase in the amount of borrowings outstanding from consolidated funds and other vehicles, (ii) the impact of closing additional clos that were consolidated during 2022 and higher interest rates on debt obligations held in consolidated clos, and (iii) the impact of issuances of our notes after december 31, 2021. partially offsetting these increases was the deconsolidation of kref in the fourth quarter of 2021. for a discussion of other factors that affected kkr's interest expense, see \"-analysis of non-gaap performance measures.\" expenses - asset management compensation and benefits expenses the decrease in compensation and benefits expense during the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 was primarily due to the reversal of previously recognized accrued carried interest, partially offset by (i) higher equity-based compensation charges and (ii) a higher level of discretionary cash compensation resulting from a higher level of segment fee related revenue and realized performance income in the current period. general, administrative and other the increase in general, administrative and other expenses during the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 was primarily due to a higher level of (i) expenses at our consolidated funds and investment vehicles, (ii) strategic corporate transaction-related charges, (iii) professional fees, information technology and other administrative costs in connection with the growth of the firm, and (iv) travel related expenses as a result of a return of travel activity to pre-covid-19 pandemic levels. in periods of significant fundraising and to the extent that we use third parties to assist in our capital raising efforts, our general, administrative and other are expected to increase accordingly. similarly, our general, administrative and other expenses are expected to increase as a result of increased levels of professional and other fees incurred as part of due diligence related to strategic acquisitions and new product development. consolidated results of operations (gaap basis) - insurance for the year ended december 31, 2021, the results of global atlantic's insurance operations included in our consolidated results of operations are from the acquisition date, february 1, 2021, through december 31, 2021. assumption review the assumptions on which reserves, deferred revenue and expenses are based are intended to represent an estimation of the benefits that are expected to be payable to, and fees or premiums that are expected to be collectible from, policyholders in future periods. global atlantic reviews the adequacy of its reserves, deferred revenue and expenses and the assumptions underlying those items at least annually, usually in the third quarter. as global atlantic analyzes its assumptions, to the extent global atlantic chooses to update one or more of those assumptions, there may be an \"unlocking\" impact. generally, favorable unlocking means the change in assumptions required a reduction in reserves, or in deferred revenue liabilities or an increase in deferred expenses, and unfavorable unlocking means the change in assumptions required an increase in reserves or in deferred revenue liabilities, or a reduction in deferred expenses. table of contents the following table reflects the impact on net income by financial statement line item and to insurance segment adjusted operating earnings from global atlantic's assumption review: years ended december 31, 2022 december 31, 2021 change ($ in thousands) impacts of assumption review, by statement of income line item: policy fees

review impact 4,749 (5,734) 10,483 total assumption review impact on insurance segment adjusted operating earnings $(7,579) $9,153 $(16,732) for the year ended december 31, 2022, the net unfavorable unlocking impact on net income and insurance segment adjusted operating earnings was primarily due to an increase in expected future surrender experience of annuity policies, partially as a result of higher interest rates, and a decrease in expected future surrender experience of life insurance policies. for the year ended december 31, 2021, the net favorable unlocking impact on net income and insurance segment adjusted operating earnings was primarily due to lower expected future mortality rates. revenues for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, revenues consisted of the following: years ended december 31, 2022 december 31, 2021 change ($ in thousands) net premiums $1,182,461 $2,226,078 $(1,043,617) policy fees 1,278,736 1,147,913 130,823 net investment income 4,118,246

premiums decreased for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily due to lower initial premiums related to fewer reinsurance transactions with life contingencies assumed during the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease was partially offset by lower retrocessions to third party reinsurers during the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021. the initial premiums on assumed reinsurance were offset by a comparable increase in policy reserves reported within net policy benefits and claims (as discussed below). policy fees policy fees increased for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily due to one less month of activity reported in the prior financial reporting period as a result of the ga acquisition on february 1, 2021. table of contents net investment income net investment income increased for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily due to (i) higher yields on floating-rate investments due to higher market interest rates, (ii) rotation into

fair value of embedded derivatives on funds withheld at interest payable for the year ended december 31, 2022 was primarily driven by the change in fair value of the underlying investments in the funds withheld at interest payable portfolio, which is primarily comprised of fixed maturity securities (designated as trading for accounting purposes), mortgage and other loan receivables, and other investments. the underlying investments in the funds withheld at interest payable portfolio declined in value in the current period primarily due to an increase in market interest rates and wider credit spreads. the increase in the fair value of equity futures was driven primarily by the performance of equity markets. global atlantic purchases equity futures primarily to hedge the market risk in our variable annuity products which are accounted for in net policy benefits and claims. the majority of global atlantic's equity futures are based on the s&p 500 index, which decreased during the year ended december 31, 2022, as compared to an increase during the year ended december 31, 2021, resulting in, respectively, a gain and a loss on equity futures contracts in the respective periods. the decrease in the fair value of equity index options was primarily driven by the performance of the indexes upon which call options are based. global atlantic purchases equity index options to hedge the market risk of embedded derivatives in indexed universal life and fixed-indexed annuity products (the change in which is accounted for in net policy benefits and claims). the majority of global atlantic's equity index call options are based on the s&p 500 index, which decreased during the year ended december 31, 2022, as compared to the increase during the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease in the fair value of interest rate contracts was driven by an increase in market interest rates during both the year ended december 31, 2022 and the prior financial reporting period, resulting in a loss on interest rate contracts. the decrease in the fair value of embedded derivatives on funds withheld at interest receivable was primarily due to widening of credit spreads during the year ended december 31, 2022, as compared to the tightening of credit spreads in the year ended december 31, 2021. table of contents net other investment losses the components of net other

trading was primarily due to an increase in interest rates and widening credit spreads in the current period, (ii) a decrease in realized gains on investments not supporting asset-liability matching strategies primarily due to the non-recurrence of a gain from the disposition of origis usa, llc (infrastructure: energy and energy transition sector) in the prior financial reporting period, (iii) the increase in realized losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity debt securities primarily due to portfolio rotation in a higher interest rate environment, (iv) an increase in credit loss allowances on mortgage and other loan receivables in the current period primarily due to an increase in credit risk of our loan portfolio, offset in part by the recognition of an initial credit loan loss allowance upon the adoption of the current expected credit loss accounting standard concurrent with the ga acquisition in the prior financial reporting period, and (v) realized losses on renewable energy investments in the current period. offsetting these losses were realized gains on funds withheld at interest payable portfolio. other income other income increased for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the prior financial reporting period primarily due to one less month of activity reported in the prior financial reporting period as a result of the ga acquisition having occurred on february 1, 2021. expenses net policy benefits and claims net policy benefits and claims decreased for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily due to (i) lower initial reserves assumed related to fewer new reinsurance transactions with life contingencies in the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021, and (ii) a decrease in the value of embedded derivatives in global atlantic's indexed universal life and fixed indexed annuity products, as a result of lower equity market returns (as discussed above under \"revenues-net gains on derivatives instruments,\" global atlantic purchases equity index options in order to hedge this risk, the fair value changes of which are accounted for in gains on derivative instruments, and generally offsetting the change in embedded derivative fair value reported in net policy benefits and claims). this decrease was offset by (i) one less month of activity reported in the prior financial reporting period as a result of the ga acquisition having occurred on february 1, 2021, (ii) an increase in net flows from both individual and institutional market channel sales, (iii) an increase in variable annuity reserves primarily due to lower equity market returns, (iv) higher funding costs on new business, and (v) unfavorable unlocking related to the assumption review described above under \"-consolidated results of operations (gaap basis)-insurance (unaudited)-assumption review.\" table of contents amortization of policy acquisition costs amortization of policy acquisition costs increased for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily due to (i) a decrease in the net benefit (that is, a reduction to expense) from the amortization of the net negative insurance intangibles recognized as part of purchase accounting of the ga acquisition, as the underlying business runs off, and (ii) growth in our individual market channel. offsetting these increases in expense was (i) a decrease of amortization due to realized investment losses in the current period, and (ii) favorable unlocking related to the assumption review described above under \"-consolidated results of operations (gaap basis)-insurance (unaudited)-assumption review.\" interest expense interest expense increased for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily due to (i) a net increase in debt outstanding, including a draw on global atlantic's revolving credit facility in the quarter ended march 31, 2022, (ii) an increase in interest expense on floating rate debt (global atlantic's revolving facility and fixed-to-floating swaps on global atlantic's fixed rate debt) due to higher market rates, and (iii) the impact of one less month of activity reported in the prior financial reporting period as a result of the ga acquisition having occurred on february 1, 2021. insurance expenses insurance expenses increased for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily due to (i) one less month of activity reported in the prior financial reporting period as a result of the ga acquisition having occurred on february 1, 2021, (ii) increased commission expense related to increased sales in our individual market and increased reinsurance transactions, and (iii) increased reinsurance ceding expense allowances paid for policy administration services as a result of an increase in reinsurance transactions. general, administrative and other general, administrative and other expenses increased for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily due to (i) one less month of activity reported in the prior financial reporting period as a result of the ga acquisition having occurred on february 1, 2021, (ii) increased employee compensation and benefits related expenses, (iii) increased professional service fees, and (iv) increased third-party administrator (\"tpa\") policy servicing fees, all due to growth of the business. other

$1,353.3 million in the prior period. the tax benefit in the current period was generated primarily from deferred tax benefits recorded in connection with pre-tax unrealized losses driven by net capital allocation-based losses and investment losses offset by income tax expense relating to global atlantic's insurance operations. for a discussion of factors that impacted kkr's tax provision,

$9,692,568 $4,230,891 $5,461,677 fees and other total fees and other for the year ended december 31, 2021 increased compared to the year ended december 31, 2020 primarily as a result of the increase in transaction fees and management fees. for a more detailed discussion of the factors that affected our transaction fees during the period, see \"-analysis of asset management segment operating results.\" the increase in management fees was primarily attributable to management fees earned from (i) north america fund xiii, global infrastructure investors iv, and health care strategic growth fund ii, all of which entered their investment periods in 2021 and (ii) asian fund iv, which entered its investment period in the third quarter of 2020. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in management fees earned from asian fund iii, americas fund xii, and global infrastructure investors iii as a result of entering their post-investment periods in the third quarter of 2020, second quarter of 2021 and second quarter of 2021, respectively, with all three investment funds now earning fees based on capital invested rather than capital committed and at a lower fee rate for asian fund iii and americas fund xii. management fees due from consolidated investment funds and other vehicles are eliminated upon consolidation under gaap. however, because these amounts are funded by, and earned from, noncontrolling interests, upon consolidation under gaap, kkr's allocated share of the net income from the consolidated investment funds and other vehicles is increased by the amount of fees that are eliminated. accordingly, net income (loss) attributable to kkr would be unchanged if such investment funds and other vehicles were not consolidated. for a more detailed discussion on the factors that affect our management fees during the period, see \"-analysis of asset management segment operating results.\" fee credits increased compared to the prior period as a result of a higher level of transaction fees in our private equity, real assets, and credit and liquid strategies business lines. fee credits owed to consolidated investment funds are eliminated upon consolidation under gaap. however, because these amounts are owed to noncontrolling interests, upon consolidation under gaap, kkr's allocated share of the net income from the consolidated investment funds is decreased by the amount of fee credits that are eliminated. accordingly, net income (loss) attributable to kkr would be unchanged if such investment funds and other vehicles were not consolidated. transaction and monitoring fees earned from kkr portfolio companies are not eliminated upon consolidation because those fees are earned from companies which are not consolidated. furthermore, table of contents transaction fees earned in our capital markets business line are not shared with fund investors. accordingly, certain transaction fees are reflected in revenues without a corresponding fee credit. capital allocation-based income (loss) the increase in carried interest and general partner capital interest during the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the prior period was due primarily to a higher level of net appreciation in the value of our investment portfolio as compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. capital allocation-based income (loss) for the year ended december 31, 2021 was positive primarily due to the net appreciation of the underlying investments at our carry-earning investment funds, most notably americas fund xii, asian fund iii and north america fund xi. capital allocation-based income (loss) for the year ended december 31, 2020 was positive due to the net appreciation of the underlying investments at our carry-earning investment funds, most notably americas fund xii, asian fund iii and north america fund xi. kkr generally calculates the carried interest that would be due to kkr for each investment fund, pursuant to the fund agreements, as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of the reporting date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. since the fair value of the underlying investments varies between reporting periods, it is necessary to make adjustments to the amounts recorded as carried interest to reflect either (a) positive performance resulting in an increase in the carried interest allocated to the general partner or (b) negative performance that would cause the amount due to kkr to be less than the amount previously recognized, resulting in a negative adjustment to carried interest allocated to the general partner. in each case, it is necessary to calculate the carried interest on cumulative results compared to the carried interest recorded to date and to make the required positive or negative adjustments. investment income (loss) - asset management net gains (losses) from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2021 the net gains from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2021 were comprised of net realized gains of $2,382.2 million and net unrealized gains of $5,338.7 million. investment

our investment in lci helicopters limited (financial services sector) and (iii) the realization of losses on certain investments held through consolidated clos and alternative credit funds. unrealized gains and losses from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2020, net unrealized gains were driven primarily by (i) mark-to-market gains in our growth equity and core investments held by kkr and certain consolidated entities, the most significant of which were bridgebio pharma, inc., fanduel inc., and petvet care centers, llc. partially offsetting these unrealized gains were unrealized losses relating to (i) the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains relating to the realization activity described above, (ii) mark-to-market losses on our investment in fiserv,

$48.9 million from our investment in epicor software corporation (technology sector). significant dividends from portfolio companies and consolidated funds are generally not recurring quarterly dividends, and while they may occur in the future, their size and frequency are variable. for a discussion of other factors that affected kkr's dividend income, see \"-analysis of asset management segment operating results.\" interest income the increase in interest income during the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the year ended december 31, 2020 was primarily due to (i) a higher level of interest income from certain of our consolidated credit funds, primarily related to an increase in the amount of capital deployed, and (ii) the impact of closing additional clos that are consolidated subsequent to december 31, 2020. partially offsetting these increases was a lower level of reported interest income from investments at kref as a result of the deconsolidation of kref in the fourth quarter of 2021. for a discussion of other factors that affected kkr's interest income, see \"-analysis of asset management segment operating results.\" interest expense the increase in interest expense during the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the year ended december 31, 2020 was primarily due to (i) the impact of issuances of our senior notes, (ii) an increase in the amount of borrowings outstanding from the financing arrangements of consolidated investment funds and other vehicles, and (iii) the impact of closing additional clos that were consolidated subsequent to december 31, 2020. partially offsetting these increases was a lower level of reported interest expense on debt obligations at kref as a result of the deconsolidation of kref in the fourth quarter of 2021. for a discussion of other factors that affected kkr's interest expense, see \"-analysis of non-gaap performance measures.\" table of contents expenses - asset management compensation and benefits expenses the increase in compensation and benefits expenses during the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the prior period was primarily due to (i) a higher level of accrued carried interest compensation resulting from a higher level of carried interest from the appreciation in the value of our investment portfolio in the current period, (ii) a higher level of accrued discretionary compensation and benefits resulting from a higher level of fee revenue, realized performance income and realized investment income in the current period, and (iii) a higher level of equity-based compensation. general, administrative and other the increase in general, administrative and other expenses during the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the prior period was primarily due to (i) a higher level of expenses at our consolidated clos, investment funds and other vehicles, (ii) a higher level of broken-deal expenses, (iii) a higher level of expenses reimbursable by our investment funds, and (iv) placement fees incurred related to capital raising activities. the level of broken-deal expenses can vary significantly period to period based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are the number of potential investments being pursued for our investment funds, the size and complexity of investments being pursued and the number of investment funds currently in their investment period. also, in periods of significant fundraising and to the extent that we use third parties to assist in our capital raising efforts, our general, administrative and other may increase accordingly. similarly, our general, administrative and other may increase as a result of professional and other fees incurred as part of due diligence related to strategic acquisitions and new product development. consolidated results of operations (gaap basis) - insurance for the year-ended december 31, 2021, the results of global atlantic's insurance operations included in our consolidated results of operations are from the acquisition date, february 1, 2021, through december 31, 2021. assumption review the assumptions on which reserves, deferred revenue and expenses are based are intended to represent an estimation of the benefits that are expected to be payable to, and fees or premiums that are expected to be collectible from, policyholders in future periods. global atlantic reviews the adequacy of its reserves, deferred revenue and expenses and the assumptions underlying those items at least annually, usually in the third quarter. as global atlantic analyzes its assumptions, to the extent global atlantic chooses to update one or more of those assumptions, there may be an \"unlocking\" impact. generally, favorable unlocking means the change in assumptions required a reduction in reserves, or in deferred revenue liabilities or an increase in deferred expenses, and unfavorable unlocking means the change in assumptions required an increase in reserves or in deferred revenue liabilities, or a reduction in deferred expenses. the following table reflects the impact on net income by financial statement line item and to insurance segment adjusted operating earnings from global atlantic's assumption review: year ended december 31, 2021 ($ in thousands) impacts of assumption review, by statement of income line item: policy fees

increase in policy reserves reported within policy benefits and claims (as discussed below). policy fees policy fees were primarily driven by cost of insurance, administrative, and rider fees during the year ended december 31, 2021. net investment income net investment income was primarily driven by insurance segment investments and the effective book yield (as determined, in part, by the allocated fair value of the investment portfolio as determined as of the ga acquisition on february 1, 2021). average insurance segment investments were primarily driven by net inflows of assets from the individual markets and institutional channels. in addition to the impact of higher asset balances, net investment income was also positively impacted by income from bond call and loan prepayment activity. net investment-related gains (losses) the components of net investment-related gains (losses) were as follows: year ended december 31, 2021 ($ in thousands) equity index options $549,987 funds withheld payable embedded derivatives 49,491 funds withheld receivable embedded derivatives 31,740 equity future contracts (263,637) interest rate contracts (146,920) foreign currency forwards

increase in the fair value of equity index options were primarily driven by the performance of the indexes upon which call options are based. global atlantic purchases equity index options to hedge the market risk of embedded derivatives in indexed universal life and fixed-indexed annuity products (the change for which is accounted for in policy benefits and claims). the majority of global atlantic's equity index call options are based on the s&p 500 index, which increased during the year ended december 31, 2021. table of contents the decrease in the fair value of equity futures and interest rate contracts were driven primarily by the performance of equity markets and interest rates. global atlantic purchases equity futures primarily to hedge the market risk in our variable annuity products which are accounted for in policy benefits and claims. the majority of global atlantic's equity futures are based on the s&p 500 index, which increased during the year ended december 31, 2021, resulting in a loss on equity futures contracts. market interest rates increased during the year ended december 31, 2021, resulting in a loss on interest rate contracts. the increase in the fair value of embedded derivatives on funds withheld at interest payable and receivable were primarily driven by the change in fair value of the underlying investments in the respective funds withheld at interest payable and receivable portfolios. net other investment losses the components of net other investment losses were as follows: year ended december 31, 2021 ($ in thousands) realized gains (losses) on investments not supporting asset-liability matching strategies $527,788 realized gains (losses) on available-for-sale fixed maturity debt securities (201,411) credit loss allowances

(30,015) realized gains (losses) on funds withheld at interest receivable portfolio 12,418 other (34,896) net other investment losses $(18,992) net other investment losses for the year ended december 31, 2021 were primarily due to (i) the recognition of a credit loan loss allowances as a result of the application of the current expected credit loss accounting standard adopted concurrent with the ga acquisition, (ii) losses on the sale of available-for-sale (\"afs\") securities as a result of portfolio rotation strategies, and (iii) net unrealized losses on trading fixed maturity securities underlying a portion of the funds withheld payable at interest portfolio due to an increase in market interest rates. these losses were almost wholly offset by realized gains (losses) on investments not supporting asset-liability matching strategies, including in particular a gain from the disposition of origis usa, llc. other income other income is mainly driven by expense allowances on ceded reinsurance, administration, management fees and distribution fees. expenses policy benefits and claims policy benefits and claims were primarily driven by (i) initial reserves related to new reinsurance transactions with life contingencies during the year ended december 31, 2021, (ii) an increase in the value of embedded derivatives in global atlantic's indexed universal life and fixed indexed annuity products, as a result of higher equity market returns (as discussed above under \"revenues-net gains on derivative instruments,\" global atlantic purchases equity index options in order to hedge this risk, the fair value changes of which are accounted for in gains on derivative instruments, and generally offsetting the change in embedded derivative fair value reported in policy benefits and claims), and (iii) an increase in net flows in the institutional and individual channels, all offset by a decrease in variable annuity reserves primarily due to higher equity market returns and market interest rates. table of contents amortization of policy acquisition costs amortization of policy acquisition costs during the year ended december 31, 2021 was primarily driven by the amortization of insurance intangibles recognized as part of purchase accounting of the global atlantic acquisition. amortization is negative (that is, a reduction to expense) as a result of the net negative value-of-business-acquired insurance intangible recognized as part of the aforementioned purchase accounting. interest expense interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2021 reflects a net increase in debt outstanding due to the issuance of new senior and subordinated notes which was partially offset by the pay-down of other debt, and the favorable impact to interest expense as a result of the lower average coupon due on new debt added at lower interest rates. insurance expenses insurance expenses were primarily driven by (i) commission expense related to sales, and (ii) reinsurance ceding expense allowances paid for policy administration services during the year ended december 31, 2021. general, administrative and other general, administrative and other expenses were driven primarily by (i) employee compensation and benefits related expenses, (ii) tpa policy servicing fees, (iii) technology hardware and software related charges, and (iv) professional fees during the year ended december 31, 2021. other consolidated results of operations (gaap basis) income tax expense (benefit) for the year ended december 31, 2021, income tax expense was $1,353.3 million compared to $609.1 million in the prior period. the increase in the income tax expense was primarily due to (i) a higher level of fees, capital allocation-based income and investment income as described above earned from asset management operations and (ii) the inclusion of income taxes relating to global atlantic's insurance operations. our effective tax rate under gaap for the year ended december 31, 2021 was 9.9%. for a discussion of factors that impacted kkr's tax provision, see note 19 \"income taxes\" in our financial statements. the amount of u.s. federal and state corporate income taxes we pay in future periods may be materially increased if adverse tax laws become enacted. see also \"-business environment-economic and market conditions\" in this report. net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31, 2021 relates primarily to net income (loss) attributable to (i) interests of kkr holdings and other exchangeable securities representing ownership interests in kkr group partnership, (ii) third-party limited partner interests in consolidated investment funds and (iii) interests that co-investors and rollover investors hold in global atlantic. net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31, 2021 increased compared to the prior period primarily due to a higher level of net income generated during the year ended december 31, 2021, allocable to the holders of the noncontrolling interests. net income (loss) attributable to kkr & co. inc. net income (loss) attributable to kkr & co. inc. for the year ended december 31, 2021 increased compared to the prior period primarily due to (i) a higher level of net gains from investment activities, capital allocation-based income, and fees earned from asset management operations during the year ended december 31, 2021 as described above and (ii) the acquisition of global atlantic, which was completed in february 2021. these increases were partially offset by accrued carried interest compensation and income tax expense, each as described above. table of

december 31, 2021. the decrease was primarily due to the (i) unrealized losses on available-for-sale-securities from global atlantic that are recorded in other comprehensive income, (ii) dividends to common stockholders, and (iii) a net loss attributable to kkr & co. inc. common stockholders during the year ended december 31, 2022. table of contents consolidated statements of cash flows (gaap basis) the following is a discussion of our consolidated cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021. you should read this discussion in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. the consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of our consolidated entities, which include certain consolidated investment funds, clos and certain variable interest entities formed by global atlantic notwithstanding the fact that we may hold only a minority economic interest in those investment funds and cfes. the assets of our consolidated investment funds and cfes, on a gross basis, can be substantially larger than the assets of our business and, accordingly, could have a substantial effect on the cash flows reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows. the primary cash flow activities of our consolidated funds and cfes involve: (i) capital contributions from fund investors; (ii) using the capital of fund investors to make investments; (iii) financing certain investments with indebtedness; (iv) generating cash flows through the realization of investments; and (v) distributing cash flows from the realization of investments to fund investors. because our consolidated funds are treated as investment companies for accounting purposes, certain of these cash flow amounts are included in our cash flows from operations. net cash provided (used) by operating activities our net cash provided (used) by operating activities was $(5.3) billion and $(7.2) billion during the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. these amounts primarily included: (i) investments purchased (asset management), net of proceeds from investments (asset management) of $(10.4) billion and $(10.6) billion

insurance operations of $(1.0) billion and $(0.9) billion during the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. investment funds are investment companies under gaap and reflect their investments and other financial instruments at fair value. net cash provided (used) by investing activities our net cash provided (used) by investing activities was $(13.6) billion and $(9.6) billion during the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. our investing activities included: (i) investments purchased (insurance), net of proceeds from investments (insurance), of $(11.8) billion and $(9.1) billion during the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, (ii) acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $(1.7) billion and $(473.8) million during the years ended

$2,071,440 $585,047 the increase in private equity business line management fees was primarily attributable to a higher level of management fees earned from north america fund xiii and european fund vi. the increase was partially offset by a decrease in management fees earned from european fund v and americas fund xii as a result of entering their post-investment periods and, consequently, we now earn fees based on capital invested rather than capital committed and at a lower fee rate. during the fourth quarter of 2022, approximately $11 million of management fees were earned on new capital raised that is retroactive to the start of the fund's investment period. table of contents the increase in real assets business line management fees was primarily due to (i) a higher level of management fees earned from global infrastructure investors iv, (ii) an increase in management fees earned from global atlantic and (iii) management fees earned on assets managed by kjrm, which we acquired in 2022. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in management fees earned from (i) real estate partners americas ii as a result of a decline in capital invested from investment realizations (of which this investment fund's fee base is invested capital) and (ii) global infrastructure investors iii as a result of entering its post-investment period and, consequently, we now earn fees based on capital invested rather than capital committed. the increase in credit and liquid strategies business line management fees was primarily attributable to (i) an increase in management fees earned from global atlantic and (ii) a higher level of management fees earned from fs kkr capital corp. (\"fsk\"), our business development company. transaction and monitoring fees, net the following table presents transaction and monitoring fees, net by business line: years ended december 31, 2022

with fund investors. the decrease in capital markets transaction fees was primarily due to a decrease in the number of capital markets transactions for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to the year ended december 31, 2021. overall, we completed 240 capital markets transactions for the year ended december 31, 2022, of which 29 represented equity offerings and 211 represented debt offerings, as compared to 358 transactions for the year ended december 31, 2021, of which 60 represented equity offerings and 298 represented debt offerings. we earned fees in connection with underwriting, syndication and other capital markets services. while each of the capital markets transactions that we undertake in this business line is separately negotiated, our fee rates are generally higher with respect to underwriting or syndicating equity offerings than with respect to debt offerings, and the amount of fees that we earn for similar transactions generally correlates with overall transaction sizes. our capital markets fees are generated in connection with activity involving our private equity, real assets and credit funds as well as from third-party companies. for the year ended december 31, 2022, approximately 14% of our transaction fees in our capital markets business line were earned from unaffiliated third parties as compared to approximately 23% for the year ended december 31, 2021. our transaction fees are comprised of fees earned from north america, europe, and the asia-pacific region. for the year ended december 31, 2022, approximately 46% of our transaction fees were generated outside of north america as compared to approximately 38% for the year ended december 31, 2021. our capital markets business line is dependent on the overall capital markets environment, which is influenced by equity prices, credit spreads, and volatility. our capital markets business line does not generate monitoring fees. our private equity, real assets and credit and liquid strategies business lines separately earn transaction and monitoring fees from portfolio companies, and under the terms of the management agreements with certain of our investment funds, we are generally required to share all or a portion of such fees with our fund investors. additionally, transaction fees are generally not earned with respect to energy and real estate investments. the decrease in our private equity business line transaction and monitoring fees, net, was primarily attributable to a lower average transaction fee earned in 2022. during the year ended december 31, 2022, there were 77 transaction fee-generating investments that paid an average fee of $5.3 million compared to 76 transaction fee-generating investments that paid an average fee of $5.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2021. for the year ended december 31, 2022, approximately 46% of private equity transaction fees were paid by companies in north america, 31% were paid from companies in the asia-pacific region, and 23% were paid from companies in europe. transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the amount of the fees as set forth in the transaction agreements, the complexity of the transaction, and kkr's role in the transaction. table of contents fee related performance revenues the

performance fees that are (i) expected to be received from our investment funds, vehicles and accounts on a recurring basis, and (ii) not dependent on a realization event involving investments held by the investment fund, vehicle or account. these performance fees are primarily earned from fsk (our business development company), kkr property partners americas (\"kppa\") (our open-ended core plus real estate fund), krest (our registered closed-end real estate equity fund), kref (our real estate credit investment trust), and kjrm (our japanese real estate investment trust asset manager). fee related performance revenues were higher for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the prior period primarily due to performance revenues earned from kppa and kjrm in the current period. fee related compensation the increase in fee related compensation for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the prior period was primarily due to a higher level of compensation recorded in connection with the higher level of revenues included within fee related earnings. other operating expenses the increase in other operating expenses for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the prior period was primarily due to (i) a higher level of professional fees, information technology and other administrative costs in connection with the growth of the firm and (ii) an increase in travel related expenses as a result of a return of travel activity to pre-covid-19 pandemic levels. fee related earnings the increase in fee related earnings for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the prior period is primarily due to a higher level of management fees from our private equity, real assets, and credit and liquid strategies business lines and a higher level of fee related performance revenues, partially offset by a lower level of transaction and monitoring fees, net, and a higher level of fee related compensation and other operating expenses, as described above. realized performance income the following table presents realized performance income by business line: years ended december 31, 2022 december 31, 2021 change ($ in thousands) realized

$1,441,578 $629,862 the increase in private equity business line management fees was primarily attributable to management fees earned from north america fund xiii, asian fund iv, and health care strategic growth fund ii. the increase was partially offset by a decrease in management fees earned from americas fund xii and asian fund iii as a result of entering their post-investment periods and, consequently, we now earn fees based on capital invested rather than capital committed and at a lower fee rate. the increase in real assets business line management fees was primarily due to (i) management fees earned from global infrastructure investors iv and real estate partners americas iii, and (ii) an increase in management fees earned from global atlantic. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in management fees earned from global infrastructure investors iii as a result of entering its post-investment period and, consequently, we now earn fees based on capital invested rather than capital committed. the increase in credit and liquid strategies business line management fees was primarily attributable to (i) management fees earned from global atlantic during the period february 1, 2021 through december 31, 2021, (ii) the issuance of new clos subsequent to december 31, 2020, (iii) higher overall fpaum at our hedge fund partnerships from investment

following table presents transaction and monitoring fees, net by business line: year ended december 31, 2021 december 31, 2020 change ($ in thousands) transaction and monitoring fees, net private

$1,004,241 $632,433 $371,808 our capital markets business line earns transaction fees, which are not shared with fund investors. the increase in transaction fees was primarily due to an increase in the number of capital markets transactions for the year ended december 31, 2021, compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. overall, we completed 358 capital markets transactions for the year ended december 31, 2021, of which 60 represented equity offerings and 298 represented debt offerings, as compared to 193 transactions for the year ended december 31, 2020, of which 36 represented equity offerings and 157 represented debt offerings. we earned fees in connection with underwriting, syndication and other capital markets services. while each of the capital markets transactions that we undertake in this business line is separately negotiated, our fee rates are generally higher with respect to underwriting or syndicating equity offerings than with respect to debt offerings, and the amount of fees that we earn for similar transactions generally correlates with overall transaction sizes. our capital markets fees are generated in connection with our private equity, real assets, and credit and liquid strategies business lines as well as from third-party companies. for the year ended december 31, 2021, approximately 23% of our transaction fees in our capital markets business line were earned from unaffiliated third parties as compared to approximately 18% for the year ended december 31, 2020. our transaction fees are comprised of fees earned from north america, europe, and the asia-pacific region. for the year ended december 31, 2021, approximately 38% of our transaction fees were generated outside of north america as compared to approximately 58% for the year ended december 31, 2020. our capital markets business line is dependent on the overall capital markets environment, which is influenced by equity prices, credit spreads, and volatility. our capital markets business line does not generate monitoring fees. our private equity, real assets, and credit and liquid strategies business lines separately earn transaction and monitoring fees from portfolio companies, and under the terms of the management agreements with certain of our investment funds, we are required to share all or a portion of such fees with our fund investors. additionally, transaction fees are generally not earned with respect to energy and real estate investments. the decrease in private equity business line transaction and monitoring fees, net was primarily attributable to the write-off of outstanding monitoring fee receivables for two portfolio companies, partially offset by an increase in net transaction fees. during the year ended december 31, 2021, there were 76 transaction fee-generating investments that paid an average fee of $5.5 million compared to 54 transaction fee-generating investments that paid an average fee of $6.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2020. for the year ended december 31, 2021, approximately 52% of these transaction fees were paid by companies in north america, 25% were paid from companies in europe, and 23% of these transaction fees were paid from companies in the asia-pacific region. transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, amount of the fees as set forth in the governing agreements, the complexity of the transaction, and kkr's role in the transaction. table of contents fee related performance revenues the following

commitments private equity as of december 31, 2021, our private equity business line had $66.3 billion of remaining uncalled capital commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions as compared to $38.8 billion as of december 31, 2020. the increase was primarily attributable to new capital commitments from fund investors, which were partially offset by capital called from fund investors to make investments during the period. table of contents real assets as of december 31, 2021, our real assets business line had $35.2 billion of remaining uncalled capital commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions as compared to $17.9 billion as of december 31, 2020. the increase was primarily attributable to new capital commitments from fund investors, which were partially offset by capital called from fund investors to make investments during the period. credit and liquid strategies as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, our credit and liquid strategies business line had $10.3 billion of remaining uncalled capital commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions. uncalled commitments remained flat against the comparable period as new capital commitments from fund investors were offset by capital called from fund investors to make investments during the period. capital invested private equity for the year ended december 31, 2021, $17.6 billion of capital was invested by our private equity business line, as compared to $14.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was driven primarily by a $1.5 billion increase in capital invested in our core investment strategy. during the year ended december 31, 2021, 60% of capital deployed in private equity was in transactions in north america, 21% was in europe, and 19% was in the asia-pacific region. the number of large private equity investments made in any quarterly or year-to-date period is volatile and, consequently, a significant amount of capital invested in one period or a few periods may not be indicative of a similar level of capital deployment in future periods. real assets for the year ended december 31, 2021, $21.4 billion of capital was invested by our real assets business line, as compared to $4.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was driven primarily by a $9.6 billion increase in capital

the year ended december 31, 2021, $34.4 billion of capital was invested by our credit and liquid strategies business line, as compared to $10.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase was primarily due to (i) capital deployed under our investment management agreements with global atlantic's insurance companies and (ii) a higher level of capital deployed across our direct lending and sig strategies. during the year ended december 31, 2021, 90% of capital deployed was in transactions in north america, 9% was in europe and 1% was in the asia-pacific region. table of contents analysis of insurance segment operating results as discussed above, our insurance segment consists solely of the operations of global atlantic, which was acquired on february 1, 2021. accordingly, prior financial reporting periods have been excluded for insurance segment results. for the year ended december 31, 2021, the results of our insurance segment is from the acquisition date, february 1, 2021, through december 31, 2021. the following tables set forth information regarding kkr's insurance segment operating results and certain key operating metrics as of and for the year ended december 31, 2021: year ended december 31, 2021 ($ in thousands) net investment income $3,329,570 net cost of insurance (1,566,681) general, administrative and other (500,410) pre-tax insurance operating earnings 1,262,479 income taxes (199,095) net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (410,833) insurance segment operating earnings $652,551 insurance segment operating earnings insurance segment operating earnings were primarily driven by net investment income and stable net cost of insurance. net investment income net investment income was primarily driven by (i) insurance segment investments and the effective book yield (as determined, in part, by the allocated fair value of the investment portfolio as of the closing date of the ga acquisition), and (ii) variable investment income from net realized gains from the sale of investments not related to asset/liability matching strategies, including in particular the disposition of origis usa, llc. average insurance segment investments were primarily driven by net inflows of assets from the individual markets and institutional channels. in addition to the impact of higher asset balances, net investment income was also impacted by income from bond call and loan prepayment activity. net cost of insurance net cost of insurance was driven primarily by stable liability performance across in-force and new business, including favorable adjustments to reserves and policy acquisition costs resulting from higher reserves and insurance intangibles established as part of the purchase accounting for the ga acquisition and the impact of assumption review (as described in \"-consolidated results of operations (gaap basis) - insurance (unaudited)\" above). general, administrative and other expenses general and administrative expenses were driven by (i) employee compensation and benefits related expenses, (ii) policy servicing fees, (iii) technology-related charges and (iv) consulting and professional fees. income taxes insurance segment income tax expense reflects the effective tax rate for the insurance segment on an operating basis, including the benefit of investment tax credits. net income attributable to noncontrolling interests income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the portion of the insurance segment adjusted operating earnings attributable to rollover and co-investors in global atlantic. table of contents analysis of non-gaap performance measures the following is a discussion of our non-gaap performance measures for the years ended december 31, 2021

segment operating results, following the acquisition of global atlantic, we re-evaluated our operating structure and the manner by which we manage and assess the performance of our businesses and allocate our resources. in the first quarter of 2021, we changed the presentation of our non-gaap performance measures principally to reflect how we evaluate our business following the global atlantic acquisition. we also believe that this revised presentation improves the comparability of our non-gaap financial information with that provided by other publicly traded companies in the alternative asset management industry. distributable operating earnings the increase in distributable operating earnings for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the prior period was primarily due to a higher level of asset management segment operating earnings and the addition of our insurance segment operating earnings in connection with the global atlantic acquisition. for a discussion of the asset management and insurance segment operating earnings, see \"-analysis of asset management segment operating results and analysis of insurance segment operating results.\" interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, interest expense relates primarily to the interest expense from our senior notes outstanding for kkr and kfn. the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the prior period was primarily attributable to new note issuances. preferred dividends the decrease in preferred dividends for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the prior period was attributable to the redemption of all of our series a and b preferred stock outstanding during the year ended december 31, 2021. income taxes paid the increase in income taxes paid for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the prior period was primarily due to a higher level of distributable operating earnings. after-tax distributable earnings the increase in after-tax distributable earnings for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the prior period was primarily due to a higher level of distributable operating earnings, partially offset by an increase in income taxes paid and interest expense, as discussed above. table of contents for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, the amount of the tax benefit from equity-based compensation included in income taxes paid was $123.1 million and $59.1 million, respectively. the inclusion of the tax benefit from equity-based compensation in after-tax distributable earnings had the effect of increasing this measure by 3% for each of the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020. non-gaap balance sheet measures book value the following table presents our calculation of book value as of

(iii) the net assets of kjrm. book value decreased 6% from december 31, 2021. the decrease was primarily attributable to (i) a reduction in net unrealized carried interest due to the reversal of previously recognized carried interest from our carried interest eligible investment funds, most notably americas fund xii, asian fund ii, and asian fund iii, (ii) a reduction in the value of our asset management segment investments of 5%, (iii) repurchases of our common stock, and (iv) payment of dividends during the period. partially offsetting these decreases was the positive impact of our after-tax distributable earnings recognized and a decrease in the amount of deferred tax liabilities during the period. for a further discussion, see \"-consolidated results of operations (gaap basis)

atlantic's investments on a consolidated basis, please see \"-global atlantic's investment portfolio\" below. global atlantic's investment portfolio as of december 31, 2022, 95% and 85% of global atlantic's available-for-sale (\"afs\") fixed maturity securities were considered investment grade under ratings from the securities valuation office of the naic and nrsros, respectively. as of december 31, 2021, 97% and 87% of global atlantic's afs fixed maturity securities were considered investment grade under ratings from naic and nrsros, respectively. securities where a rating by an nrsro was not available are considered investment grade if they have an naic designation of \"1\" or \"2.\" the three largest asset categories in global atlantic's afs fixed-maturity security portfolio as of december 31, 2022 were corporate, rmbs and cmbs securities, comprising 29%, 5% and 5% of global atlantic's investment portfolio, respectively. within these categories, 94%, 95% and 95% of global atlantic's corporate, rmbs and cmbs securities, respectively, were investment grade according to naic ratings and 94%, 45% and 53% of its corporate, rmbs and cmbs securities, respectively, were investment grade according to nrsro ratings as of december 31, 2022. the three largest asset categories in global atlantic's afs fixed-maturity security portfolio as of december 31, 2021 were corporate, rmbs and cmbs securities, comprising 34%, 6% and 5% of global atlantic's investment portfolio, respectively. within these categories, 95%, 96% and 99% of global atlantic's corporate, rmbs and cmbs table of contents securities, respectively, were investment grade according to naic ratings and 95%, 38% and 62% of its corporate, rmbs and cmbs securities, respectively, were investment grade according to nrsro ratings as of december 31, 2021. nrsro and naic ratings have different methodologies. global atlantic believes the naic ratings methodology, which considers the likelihood of recovery of amortized cost as opposed to the recovery of all contractual payments including the principal at par, as the more appropriate way to view the ratings quality of its afs fixed maturity portfolio since a large portion of its holdings were purchased at a significant discount to par value. the portion of global atlantic's investment portfolio consisting of floating rate assets was 29% and 20% as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. within the funds withheld receivable at interest portfolio, 97% and 96% of the fixed maturity securities were investment grade by naic designation as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. trading fixed maturity securities back funds withheld payable at interest where the investment performance is ceded to reinsurers under the terms of the respective reinsurance agreements. credit quality of afs fixed maturity securities the securities valuation office of the naic evaluates the afs fixed maturity security investments of insurers for regulatory reporting and capital assessment purposes and assigns securities to one of six credit quality categories called \"naic designations.\" using an internally developed rating is permitted by the naic if no rating is available. these designations are generally similar to the credit quality designations of nrsros for marketable fixed maturity securities, except for certain structured securities as described below. naic designations of \"1,\" highest quality, and \"2,\" high quality, include fixed maturity securities generally considered investment grade by nrsros. naic designations \"3\" through \"6\" include fixed maturity securities generally considered below investment grade by nrsros. consistent with the naic process and procedures manual, an nrsro rating was assigned based on the following criteria: (i) the equivalent s&p rating where the security is rated by one nrsro; (ii) the equivalent s&p rating of the lowest nrsro when the security is rated by two nrsros; and (iii) the equivalent s&p rating of the second lowest nrsro if the security is rated by three or more nrsros. if the lowest two nrsros' ratings are equal, then such rating will be the assigned rating. nrsros' ratings available for the periods presented were s&p, fitch, moody's, dbrs, inc. and kroll bond rating agency, inc. if no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used. substantially all of the afs fixed maturity securities portfolio, 95% and 97% as of december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021, respectively, were invested in investment grade assets with a naic rating of 1 or 2. the portion of the afs fixed maturity securities portfolio that was considered below investment grade by naic designation was 5% and 3% as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. pursuant to global atlantic's investment guidelines, global atlantic actively monitors the percentage of its portfolio that is held in investments rated naic 3 or lower and must obtain an additional approval from global atlantic's management investment committee before making a significant investment in an asset rated naic 3 or lower. corporate fixed maturity securities global atlantic maintains a diversified portfolio of corporate fixed maturity securities across industries and issuers. as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, 59% and 60%, respectively, of the afs fixed maturity securities portfolio was invested in corporate fixed maturity securities. as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately, 5% and 3%, respectively, of the portfolio is denominated in foreign currency. as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, 94% and 95% of the total fair value of corporate fixed maturity securities is rated naic investment grade and 94% and 95% is rated nrsros investment grade, respectively. residential mortgage-backed securities as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, 10% and 11% of the afs fixed maturity securities portfolio was invested in rmbs, respectively. rmbs are securities constructed from pools of residential mortgages and backed by payments from those pools. excluding limitations on access to lending and other extraordinary economic conditions, global atlantic would expect prepayments of principal on the underlying loans to accelerate with decreases in market interest rates and diminish with increases in market interest rates. table of contents the naic designations for rmbs, including prime, sub-prime, alt-a, and adjustable rate mortgages with variable payment options (\"option arm\"), are based upon a comparison of the bond's amortized cost to the naic's loss expectation for each security. accordingly, an investment in the same security at a lower cost may result in a higher quality naic designation in recognition of the lower likelihood the investment would result in a realized loss. prime residential mortgage lending includes loans to the most creditworthy borrowers with high quality credit profiles. alt-a is a classification of mortgage loans where the risk profile of the borrower is between prime and sub-prime. sub-prime mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to borrowers with weak credit profiles. as of december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021, 90% and 93%, respectively, of rmbs securities that are below investment grade as rated by the nrsro, carry an naic 1 (\"highest quality\") designation. as of december 31, 2022, alt-a, option arm, re-performing and sub-prime represent 31%, 28%, 14% and 12% of the total rmbs portfolio ($6.4 billion), respectively. as of december 31, 2021, alt-a, option arm, re-performing and sub-prime represent 33%, 30%, 14% and 12% of the total rmbs portfolio ($7.7 billion), respectively. unrealized gains and losses for afs fixed maturity securities global atlantic's investments in afs fixed maturity securities are reported at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income as unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes and offsets. unrealized gains and losses can be created by changes in interest rates or by changes in credit spreads. as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, global atlantic had gross unrealized losses on below investment grade afs fixed maturity securities of $917.6 million and $80.3 million based on nrsro rating and $224.9 million and $13.5 million based on naic ratings, respectively. unrealized losses were not recognized in net income on these debt securities because there were no specific securities that, as of each such date, global atlantic intended to sell or believed it was more likely than not that it would be required to sell before recovery of their cost or amortized cost basis. mortgage and other loan receivables - credit quality indicators mortgage and other loan receivables consist of commercial and residential mortgage loans, and other loan receivables. as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, 28% and 23%, respectively, of global atlantic's total investments consisted of mortgage and other loan receivables. global atlantic invests in u.s. mortgage loans, comprised of first lien and mezzanine real estate loans, residential mortgage loans, consumer loans, and other loan receivables. global atlantic's commercial mortgage loans may also be rated based on naic designations, with designations \"cm1\" and \"cm2\" considered to be investment grade. as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, 88% and 96% of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio was rated investment grade based on naic designation, respectively. 100% of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio is in current status. as of december 31, 2022, 96% of the residential mortgage loan portfolio is in current status, and approximately $192.3 million is over 90 days past due (representing 2% of the total residential mortgage portfolio). the loan-to-value ratio is expressed as a percentage of the current amount of the loan relative to the value of the underlying collateral. approximately 84% of the commercial mortgage loans has a loan-to-value ratio of 70% or less and 3% has loan-to-value ratio over 90%. changing economic conditions affect global atlantic's valuation of commercial mortgage loans. changing vacancies and rents are incorporated into the discounted cash flow analysis that global atlantic performs for monitored loans and may contribute to the establishment of (or increase or decrease in) a commercial mortgage loan valuation allowance for losses. in addition, global atlantic continuously monitors its commercial mortgage loan portfolio to identify risk. areas of emphasis are properties that have exposure to specific geographic events or have deteriorating credit. the weighted average loan-to-value ratio for residential mortgage loans was 64% and 68% as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. global atlantic's residential mortgage loan portfolio is comprised mainly of re-performing loans that were purchased at a discount after they were modified and returned to performing status, as well as prime jumbo loans and mortgage loans backed by single family rental properties. global atlantic has also extended financing to counterparties in the form of repurchase agreements secured by mortgage loans, including performing and non-performing mortgage loans. table of contents global atlantic's consumer loan portfolio is primarily comprised of home improvement loans, solar panel loans, student loans and auto loans. reconciliations to gaap measures the following tables reconcile the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and

assets and liabilities, which we anticipate will be settled for cash within one year, and (ii) seeking to maintain access to sufficient liquidity through various sources. the overall liquidity framework and cash management approach of our insurance business are also based on seeking to build an investment portfolio that is cash flow matched, providing cash inflows from insurance assets that meet our insurance companies' expected cash outflows to pay their liabilities. our primary cash flow activities typically involve: (i) generating cash flow from operations; (ii) generating income from investment activities, by investing in investments that generate yield (namely interest and dividends), as well as through the sale of investments and other assets; (iii) funding capital commitments that we have made to, and advancing capital to, our funds and clos; (iv) developing and funding new investment strategies, investment products, and other growth initiatives, including acquisitions of other investments, assets, and businesses; (v) underwriting and funding commitments in our capital markets business; (vi) distributing cash flow to our stockholders and holders of our preferred stock; and (vii) paying borrowings, interest payments, and repayments under credit agreements, our senior and subordinated notes, and other borrowing arrangements. see \"-liquidity-liquidity needs-dividends.\" see \"-business environment\" for more information on factors that may impact our business, financial performance, operating results and valuations. table of contents sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity consist of amounts received from: (i) our operating activities, including the fees earned from our funds, portfolio companies, and capital markets transactions; (ii) realizations on carried interest from our investment funds; (iii) interest and dividends from investments that generate yield, including our investments in clos; (iv) in our insurance business, cash inflows in respect of new premiums, policyholder deposits, reinsurance transactions and funding agreements, including through memberships in federal home loan banks; (v) realizations on and sales of investments and other assets, including the transfers of investments or other assets for fund formations (including clos and other investment vehicles); and (vi) borrowings, including advances under our revolving credit facilities, debt offerings, repurchase agreements, and other borrowing arrangements. in addition, we may generate cash proceeds from issuances of our or our subsidiaries' equity securities. many of our investment funds like our private equity and real assets funds provide for carried interest. with respect to our carry-paying investment funds, carried interest is eligible to be distributed to the general partner of the fund only after all of the following are met: (i) a realization event has occurred (e.g., sale of a portfolio company, dividend, etc.); (ii) the vehicle has achieved positive overall investment returns since its inception, in excess of performance hurdles where applicable, and is accruing carried interest; and (iii) with respect to investments with a fair value below cost, cost has been returned to fund investors in an amount sufficient to reduce remaining cost to the investments' fair value. even after all of the preceding conditions are met, the general partner of the fund may, in its sole discretion, decide to defer the distribution of carried interest to it to a later date. in addition, these funds generally include what is called a \"clawback\" provision, which provides that the general partner must return any carried interest that is paid in excess of what the general partner is entitled to receive at the end of the term of the fund, as discussed further below. as of december 31, 2022, certain of our investment funds had met the first and second criteria, as described above, but did not meet the third criteria. in these cases, carried interest accrues on the consolidated statement of operations, but will not be distributed in cash to us as the general partner of an investment fund upon a realization event. for a fund that has a fair value above cost, overall, and is otherwise accruing carried interest, but has one or more investments where fair value is below cost, the shortfall between cost and fair value for such investments is referred to as a \"netting hole.\" when netting holes are present, realized gains on individual investments that would otherwise allow the general partner to receive carried interest distributions are instead used to return invested capital to our funds' limited partners in an amount equal to the netting hole. once netting holes have been filled with either (a) return of capital equal to the netting hole for those investments where fair value is below cost or (b) increases in the fair value of those investments where fair value is below cost, then realized carried interest will be distributed to the general partner upon a realization event. a fund that is in a position to pay cash carry refers to a fund for which carried interest is expected to be paid to the general partner upon the next material realization event, which includes funds with no netting holes as well as funds with a netting hole that is sufficiently small in size such that the next material realization event would be expected to result in the payment of carried interest. strategic investor partnerships with fund investors may require netting across the various funds in which they invest, which may reduce the carried interest we otherwise would have earned if such fund investors were to have invested in our funds without the existence of the strategic investor partnership. as of december 31, 2022, there was no netting hole in excess of $50 million at any of our investment funds that had a fair value above cost, overall, and is otherwise accruing carried interest. in accordance with the criteria set forth above, other funds currently have and may in the future develop netting holes, and netting holes for those and other funds may otherwise increase or decrease in the future. there are also investment funds that are not accruing carried interest and do not have a netting hole although they may be in a clawback position. if the investment fund has distributed carried interest, but subsequently does not have sufficient value to provide for the distribution of carried interest at the end of the life of the investment fund, the general partner is typically required to return previously distributed carried interest to the fund investors. although our current and former employees who received distributions of carried interest subject to clawback are required to return them to kkr, it is kkr's obligation to return carried interest subject to clawback to the fund investors. as of december 31, 2022, approximately $520 million of carried interest was subject to this clawback obligation, assuming that all applicable carry-paying funds and their alternative investment vehicles were liquidated at their december 31, 2022 fair values. as of december 31, 2022, asia fund ii is the only investment fund with a clawback obligation in excess of $50 million. see note 25 \"commitments and contingencies-contingent repayment guarantees\" in our financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further information. we have access to funding under various credit facilities, other borrowing arrangements and other sources of liquidity that we have entered into with major financial institutions or which we receive from the capital markets. table of contents for a discussion of our debt obligations, including our debt securities, revolving credit agreements and loans, see note 17 \"debt obligations\" in our financial statements. liquidity needs we expect that our (including global atlantic's) primary liquidity needs will consist of cash required to meet various obligations, including, without limitation, to: •continue to support and grow our asset management business lines, including seeding new investment strategies, supporting capital commitments made by our vehicles to existing and future funds, co-investments and any net capital requirements of our capital markets companies and otherwise supporting the investment vehicles that we sponsor; •continue to support and grow our insurance business; •grow and expand our businesses generally, including by acquiring or launching new, complementary or adjacent businesses; •warehouse investments in portfolio companies or other investments for the benefit of one or more of our funds, accounts or clos or other investment vehicles pending the contribution of committed capital by the fund investors in such vehicles, and advancing capital to them for operational or other needs; •service debt obligations including the payment of obligations at maturity, on interest payment dates or upon redemption, as well as any contingent liabilities, including from litigation, that may give rise to future cash payments, including funding requirements to levered investment vehicles or structured transactions; •fund cash operating expenses and contingencies, including for litigation matters and guarantees; •pay corporate income taxes and other taxes; •pay policyholders and amounts in our insurance business related to investment, reinvestment, reinsurance or funding agreement activity; •pay amounts that may become due under our tax receivable agreement; •pay cash dividends in accordance with our dividend policy for our common stock or the terms of our preferred stock, if any; •underwrite commitments, advance loan proceeds and fund syndication commitments within our capital markets business; •post or return collateral in respect of derivative contracts; •acquire other assets for our principal activities business line, including other businesses, investments and assets, some of which may be required to satisfy regulatory requirements for our capital markets business or risk retention requirements for clos (to the extent they may apply); •address capital needs of regulated subsidiaries as well as non-regulated subsidiaries; and •repurchase shares of our common stock or retire equity awards pursuant to the share repurchase program or repurchase or redeem other securities issued by us. for a discussion of kkr's share repurchase program, see note 23 \"equity\" in our financial statements. capital commitments the agreements governing our active investment funds generally require the general partners of the funds to make minimum capital commitments to such funds, which generally range from 2% to 8% of a fund's total capital commitments at final closing, but may be greater for certain funds (i) where we are pursuing newer strategies, (ii) where third party investor demand is limited, and (iii) where a larger commitment is consistent with the asset allocation strategy for our principal activities business line, including core investments and exposure to the asia-pacific region. table of contents the following table presents our uncalled commitments to our active investment funds and other vehicles as of december 31, 2022: uncalled commitments private

to the uncalled commitments to our investment funds as shown above, kkr has entered into contractual commitments primarily with respect to underwriting transactions, debt financing, revolving credit facilities, and equity syndications in our capital markets business line. as of december 31, 2022, these commitments amounted to $0.7 billion. whether these amounts are actually funded, in whole or in part, depends on the contractual terms of such commitments, including the satisfaction or waiver of any conditions to closing or funding. our capital markets business has arrangements with third parties, which reduce our risk under certain circumstances when underwriting certain debt transactions, and thus our unfunded commitments as of december 31, 2022 have been reduced to reflect the amount to be funded by such third parties. in the case of purchases of investments or assets in our principal activities business line, the amount to be funded includes amounts that are intended to be syndicated to third parties, and the actual amounts to be funded may be less. for more information about our capital markets business line's risks, see \"risks related to our business-our capital markets activities expose us to material risks.\" table of contents from time to time, we fund various underwriting, syndication and fronting commitments in our capital markets business in connection with the arranging or underwriting of loans, securities or other financial instruments, for which we may draw all or substantially all of our availability for borrowings under our available credit facilities. we generally expect these borrowings by our capital markets business line to be repaid promptly as these commitments are syndicated to third parties or otherwise fulfilled or terminated, although we may in some instances elect to retain a portion of the commitments for our own investment. for more information about our capital markets business line's risks, see \"risks related to our business-our capital markets activities expose us to material risks\" in this report. tax receivable agreement on may 30, 2022, kkr terminated the tax receivable agreement with kkr holdings other than with respect to exchanges of kkr holdings units completed prior to such date. as of december 31, 2022, an undiscounted payable of $420.6 million has been recorded in due to affiliates in the financial statements representing management's best estimate of the amounts currently expected to be owed for certain exchanges of kkr holdings units that took place prior to the termination of the tax receivable agreement. as of december 31, 2022, approximately $60.4 million of cumulative cash payments have been made under the tax receivable agreement since inception. dividends a dividend of $0.155 per share of our common stock has been declared and will be paid on march 7, 2023 to holders of record of our common stock as of the close of business on february 17, 2023. a dividend of $0.75 per share of series c mandatory convertible preferred stock has been declared and set aside for payment on march 15, 2023 to holders of record of series c mandatory convertible preferred stock as of the close of business on march 1, 2023. when kkr & co. inc. receives distributions from kkr group partnership, holders of exchangeable securities receive their pro rata share of such distributions from kkr group partnership. the declaration and payment of dividends to our common stockholders will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors, and our dividend policy may be changed at any time. we announced on february 7, 2023 that our current dividend policy will be to pay dividends to holders of our common stock in an annual aggregate amount of $0.66 per share (or a quarterly dividend of $0.165 per share) beginning with the dividend to be announced with the results for the first quarter of 2023. the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors based on a number of factors, including kkr's future financial performance and other considerations that the board of directors deems relevant, and compliance with the terms of kkr & co. inc.'s certificate of incorporation and applicable law. for u.s. federal income tax purposes, any dividends we pay (including dividends on our preferred stock) generally will be treated as qualified dividend income for u.s. individual stockholders to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for u.s. federal income tax purposes. there can be no assurance that future dividends will be made as intended or at all or that any particular dividend policy for our common stock will be maintained. furthermore, the declaration and payment of distributions by kkr group partnership and our other subsidiaries may also be subject to legal, contractual and regulatory restrictions, including restrictions contained in our debt agreements and the terms of the preferred units of kkr group partnership. contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies in the ordinary course of business, we (including global atlantic) and our consolidated funds and cfes enter into contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments. contractual arrangements include (1) commitments to fund the purchase of investments or other assets (including obligations to fund capital commitments as the general partner of our investment funds) or to fund collateral for derivative transactions or otherwise, (2) obligations arising under our senior notes, subordinated notes, and other indebtedness, (3) commitments by our capital markets business to underwrite transactions or to lend capital, (4) obligations arising under insurance policies written, (5) other contractual obligations, including servicing agreements with third-party administrators for insurance policy administration, and (6) commitments to fund the business, operations or investments of our subsidiaries. in addition, we may incur contingent liabilities for claims that may be made against us in the future. for more information about these contingent liabilities, please see note 25 \"commitments and contingencies\" in our financial statements. table of contents the following table sets forth information relating to anticipated future cash payments as of december 31, 2022

amounts committed by us to fund a portion of the purchase price paid for each investment made by our investment funds which are actively investing. because capital contributions are due on demand, the above commitments have been presented as falling due within one year. however, given the size of such commitments and the pace at which our investment funds make investments, we expect that the capital commitments presented above will be called over a period of several years. see \"-liquidity needs\" and note 17 \"debt obligations\" in our financial statements. (2)amounts include senior notes and subordinated notes issued by kkr and its subsidiaries. kfn's debt obligations are non-recourse to kkr beyond the assets of kfn. (3)these interest obligations on debt represent estimated interest to be paid over the term of the related debt obligation, which has been calculated assuming the debt outstanding at december 31, 2022 is not repaid until its maturity. future interest rates are assumed to be those in effect as of december 31, 2022, including both variable and fixed rates, as applicable, provided for by the relevant debt agreements. the amounts presented above include accrued interest on outstanding indebtedness. (4)represents various commitments in our capital markets business in connection with the underwriting of loans, securities and other financial instruments. these commitments are shown net of amounts syndicated. (5)represents obligations in our capital markets business to lend under various revolving credit facilities. (6)represents commitments of kkr's asset management business line including kfn to fund the purchase of various investments. (7)global atlantic has other obligations related to collateral payable held for derivative instruments ($466.4 million) and outstanding commitments to make investments in commercial mortgage loans, other lending facilities and other investments ($3.3 billion) which have not been included in the above table as the exact timing of these payments cannot be estimated. global atlantic's debt obligations are non-recourse to kkr beyond the assets of global atlantic. (8)policy liabilities for insurance obligations consist of amounts required to meet future obligations for future policy benefits and policy account balances. amounts presented in the table represent estimated cash payments under such contracts, including significant assumptions related to the receipt of future premiums, mortality, lapse, renewal, withdrawal, and annuitization comparable with actual experience. these assumptions also include market growth and policy crediting consistent with assumptions used in amortizing dac. all estimated cash payments are not discounted to present value. accordingly, the total of cash flows presented for all years of $170.1 billion significantly exceeds total policy liabilities of $141.2 billion recorded on the statements of financial condition as of december 31, 2022. estimated cash payments are also presented gross of reinsurance. due to the significance of the assumptions used, the amounts presented could differ materially from actual results. (9)the payments due by period for debt obligations reflects the contractual maturities of principal. (10)reflects estimated future interest payments. future interest on variable rate debt (which includes borrowing under our revolving credit facility and the subordinated debentures) was computed using prevailing rates as of december 31, 2022 and, as such, does not consider the impact of future rate movements. future interest on fixed rate debt was computed using the stated rate on the obligations. (11)reflects operational servicing agreements with third-party administrators for policy administration. (12)represents uncalled commitments of our consolidated funds excluding kkr's portion of uncalled commitments as the general partner of the respective funds. because capital contributions are due on demand, the above commitments have been presented as falling due within one year. however, given the size of such commitments and the pace at which our investment funds make investments, we expect that the capital commitments presented above will be called over a period of several years. see \"-liquidity needs\" and note 17 \"debt obligations\" in our financial statements. (13)amounts include (i) financing arrangements entered into by our consolidated funds with the objective of providing liquidity to the funds of $9.0 billion, (ii) debt securities issued by our consolidated clos of $22.3 billion and (iii) borrowings collateralized by fund investments, fund co-investments and other assets held by levered investment vehicles of $2.3 billion. debt securities issued by consolidated clo entities are supported solely by the investments held at the clo vehicles and are not collateralized by assets of any other kkr entity. borrowings by levered investment vehicles are supported solely by the investments held at the investment vehicles and are not collateralized by assets of any other kkr entity. obligations under financing arrangements entered into by our consolidated funds are generally limited to our pro rata equity interest in such funds. our management companies bear no obligations to repay any financing arrangements at our consolidated funds. (14)represents a debt obligation in connection with the ownership of kkr office space. (15)the interest obligations on debt of our cfes and other borrowings represent estimated interest to be paid over the term of the related debt obligation, which has been calculated assuming the debt outstanding at december 31, 2022 is not repaid until its maturity. future interest rates are assumed to be those in effect as of december 31, 2022, including both variable and fixed rates, as applicable, provided for by the relevant debt agreements. the amounts presented above include accrued interest on outstanding indebtedness. the commitment table above excludes contractual amounts owed under the tax receivable agreement because the ultimate amount and timing of the amounts due are not presently known. see \"-liquidity needs-tax receivable agreement\" in this report and \"risk factors-we will be required to pay our principals for most of the benefits relating to our use of tax attributes we receive from certain prior exchanges of our common stock for kkr group partnership units\" in this report. off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities other than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business. critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of fees, capital allocation-based income (loss), expenses, investment income, and income taxes. our management bases these estimates and judgments on available information, historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. however, these estimates, judgments and assumptions are often subjective and may be impacted negatively based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. if actual amounts are ultimately different from those estimated, judged or assumed, revisions are included in the financial statements in the period in which the actual amounts become known. we believe our critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying estimates, judgments or assumptions. for a further discussion about our critical accounting policies, see note 2 \"summary of significant accounting policies\" in our financial statements included in this report. basis of accounting we consolidate the financial results of kkr group partnership and its consolidated entities, which include the accounts of our investment advisers, broker-dealers, global atlantic's insurance companies, the general partners of certain unconsolidated investment funds, general partners of consolidated investment funds and their respective consolidated investment funds and certain other entities including cfes. when an entity is consolidated, we reflect the accounts of the consolidated entity, including its assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, investment income, cash flows and other amounts, on a gross basis. while the consolidation of an investment fund or entity does not have an effect on the amounts of net income attributable to kkr or kkr's stockholders' equity that kkr reports, the consolidation does significantly impact the financial statement presentation under gaap. this is due to the fact that the accounts of the consolidated entities are reflected on a gross basis while the allocable share of those amounts that are attributable to third parties are reflected as single line items. the single line items in which the accounts attributable to third parties are recorded are presented as noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of financial condition and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of operations. table of contents the presentation in the financial statements reflect the significant industry diversification of kkr by its acquisition of global atlantic. global atlantic operates an insurance business, and kkr operates an asset management business, each of which possess distinct characteristics. as a result, kkr developed a two-tiered presentation approach for the financial statements in this management's discussion and analysis. kkr believes that these separate presentations provide a more informative view of the consolidated financial position and results of operations than traditional aggregated presentations. kkr believes that reporting global atlantic's insurance operations separately is appropriate given, among other factors, the relative significance of global atlantic's policy liabilities, which are not obligations of kkr (other than the insurance companies that issued them). if a traditional aggregated presentation were to be used, kkr would expect to eliminate or combine several identical or similar captions, which would condense the presentations but would reduce transparency. kkr also believes that using a traditional aggregated presentation would result in no new line items compared to the two-tier presentation included in the financial statements in this report. we acquired global atlantic on february 1, 2021; accordingly, the results of global atlantic's insurance operations included in our consolidated results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2021 are from february 1, 2021 (the closing date of the ga acquisition) through december 31, 2021. consolidation kkr consolidates all entities that it controls either through a majority voting interest or as the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities (\"vies\"). the following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of consolidation principles impact our financial results, and management's process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment. for a detailed description of our accounting policy on consolidation, see note 2 \"summary of significant accounting policies\" in our financial statements included in this report. as part of its consolidation procedures, kkr evaluates: (1) whether it holds a variable interest in an entity, (2) whether the entity is a vie, and (3) whether the kkr's involvement would make it the primary beneficiary. the determination that kkr holds a controlling financial interest in an investment vehicle significantly changes the presentation of our consolidated financial statements. the assessment of whether we consolidate an investment vehicle we manage requires the application of significant judgment. these judgments are applied both at the time we become involved with an investment vehicle and on an ongoing basis and include, but are not limited to: •determining whether our management fees, carried interests or incentive fees represent variable interests - we make judgments as to whether the fees we earn are commensurate with the level of effort required for those fees and at market rates. in making this judgment, we consider, among other things, the extent of third party investment in the entity and the terms of any other interests we hold in the vie. •determining whether a legal entity qualifies as a vie - for those entities where kkr holds a variable interest, management determines whether each of these entities qualifies as a vie and, if so, whether or not kkr is the primary beneficiary. the assessment of whether the entity is a vie is generally performed qualitatively, which requires judgment. these judgments include: (a) determining whether the equity investment at risk is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, (b) evaluating whether the equity holders, as a group, can make decisions that have a significant effect on the economic performance of the entity, (c) determining whether two or more parties' equity interests should be aggregated, and (d) determining whether the equity investors have proportionate voting rights to their obligations to absorb losses or rights to receive returns from an entity. entities that do not qualify as vies are generally assessed for consolidation as voting interest entities. under the voting interest entity model, the company consolidates those entities it controls through a majority voting interest. •concluding whether kkr has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie - as there is no explicit threshold in gaap to define \"potentially significant,\" we must apply judgment and evaluate both quantitative and qualitative factors to conclude whether this threshold is met. changes to these judgments could result in a change in the consolidation conclusion for a legal entity. fair value measurements fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. table of contents gaap establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. investments and other financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed based on the observability of inputs used in the determination of fair values, as follows: level i pricing inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date. level ii pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date, and fair value is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies. level iii pricing inputs are unobservable for the financial instruments and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the financial instrument. the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. the valuation of our level iii investments at december 31, 2022 represents management's best estimate of the amounts that we would anticipate realizing on the sale of these investments in an orderly transaction at such date. in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. in such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. level iii valuation methodologies our investments and financial instruments are impacted by various economic conditions and events outside of our control that are difficult to quantify or predict, which may have a significant impact on the valuation of our investments and, therefore, on the carried interest and investment income we realize. additionally, a change in interest rates could have a significant impact on valuations. across the total level iii private equity investment portfolio (including core private equity investments), and including investments in both consolidated and unconsolidated investment funds, approximately 55% of the fair value is derived from investments that are valued based exactly 50% on market comparables and 50% on a discounted cash flow analysis. less than 5% of the fair value of this level iii private equity investment portfolio is derived from investments that are valued either based 100% on market comparables or 100% on a discounted cash flow analysis. as of december 31, 2022, the overall weights ascribed to the market comparables methodology, the discounted cash flow methodology, and a methodology based on pending sales for this portfolio of level iii private equity investments were 38%, 55%, and 7%, respectively. there is inherent uncertainty involved in the valuation of level iii investments, and there is no assurance that, upon liquidation, kkr will realize the values reflected in our valuations. our valuations may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had an active market for the investments existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material. see \"-business environment\" for more information on factors that may impact our business, financial performance, operating results and valuations. key unobservable inputs that have a significant impact on our level iii valuations as described above are included in note 10 \"fair value measurements\" in our financial statements. level iii valuation process the valuation process involved for level iii measurements is completed on a quarterly basis and is designed to subject the valuation of level iii investments to an appropriate level of consistency, oversight, and review. for private equity and real asset investments classified as level iii, investment professionals prepare preliminary valuations based on their evaluation of financial and operating data, company specific developments, market valuations of comparable companies and other factors. kkr begins its procedures to determine the fair values of its level iii assets approximately one month prior to the end of a reporting period, and kkr follows additional procedures to ensure that its determinations of fair value for its level iii assets are appropriate as of the relevant reporting date. these preliminary valuations are reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by kkr to perform certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of kkr's valuations annually for all level iii private equity and real asset investments and quarterly for table of contents investments other than certain investments, which have values less than preset value thresholds and which in the aggregate comprise less than 1% of the total value of kkr's level iii private equity and real asset investments. the valuations of certain real asset investments are determined solely by independent valuation firms without the preparation of preliminary valuations by our investment professionals, and instead such independent valuation firms rely on valuation information available to it as a broker or valuation firm. for credit investments, an independent valuation firm is generally engaged by kkr to assist with the valuations of most investments classified as level iii. the valuation firm either provides a value, provides a valuation range from which kkr's investment professionals select a point in the range to determine the valuation, or performs certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of kkr's valuations. after reflecting any input from the independent valuation firm, the valuation proposals are submitted for review and approval by kkr's valuation committees. as of december 31, 2022, less than 3% of the total value of our level iii credit investments were not valued with the engagement of an independent valuation firm. for level iii investments in asset management, kkr has a global valuation committee that is responsible for coordinating and implementing the firm's valuation process to ensure consistency in the application of valuation principles across portfolio investments and between periods. the global valuation committee is assisted by the asset class-specific valuation committees that exist for private equity (including core equity investments and certain impact investments), growth equity (including certain impact investments), real estate, energy, infrastructure and credit. the asset class-specific valuation committees are responsible for the review and approval of all preliminary level iii valuations in their respective asset classes on a quarterly basis. the members of these valuation committees are comprised of investment professionals, including the heads of each respective strategy, and professionals from business operations functions such as legal, compliance and finance, who are not primarily responsible for the management of the investments. all level iii valuations for investments in asset management are also subject to approval by the global valuation committee, which is comprised of senior employees including investment professionals and professionals from business operations functions, and includes kkr's co-chief executive officers and its chief financial officer, chief legal officer, general counsel, and chief compliance officer. when valuations are approved by the global valuation committee after reflecting any input from it, the valuations of level iii investments, as well as the valuations of level i and level ii investments, are presented to the audit committee of the board of directors of kkr & co. inc. and are then reported to the board of directors. level iii investments held by global atlantic are valued on the basis of pricing services, broker-dealers or internal models. global atlantic performs a quantitative and qualitative analysis and review of the information and prices received from independent pricing services as well as broker-dealers to verify that it represents a reasonable estimate of fair value. as of december 31, 2022, approximately 87% of these investments were priced via external sources, while approximately 13% were valued on the basis of internal models. for all the internally developed models, global atlantic seeks to verify the reasonableness of fair values by analyzing the inputs and other assumptions used. these preliminary valuations are reviewed, based on certain thresholds, by an independent valuation firm engaged by global atlantic to perform certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of global atlantic's valuations. when valuations are approved by global atlantic's management, the valuations of its level iii investments, as well as the valuations of level i and level ii investments, are presented to the audit committee of the board of directors of kkr & co. inc. and are then reported to the board of directors. as of december 31, 2022, upon completion by, where applicable, independent valuation firms of certain limited procedures requested to be performed by them on certain level iii investments, the independent valuation firms concluded that the fair values, as determined by kkr (including global atlantic), of those investments reviewed by them were reasonable. the limited procedures did not involve an audit, review, compilation or any other form of examination or attestation under generally accepted auditing standards and were not conducted on all level iii investments. we are responsible for determining the fair value of investments in good faith, and the limited procedures performed by an independent valuation firm are supplementary to the inquiries and procedures that we are required to undertake to determine the fair value of the commensurate investments. as described above, level ii and level iii investments were valued using internal models with significant unobservable inputs, and our determinations of the fair values of these investments may differ materially from the values that would have resulted if readily observable inputs had existed. additional external factors may cause those values, and the values of investments for which readily observable inputs exist, to increase or decrease over time, which may create volatility in our earnings and the amounts of assets and stockholders' equity that we report from time to time. changes in the fair value of investments impacts the amount of carried interest that is recognized as well as the amount of investment income that is recognized for investments held directly in asset management and through our consolidated funds as described below. we estimate that an immediate 10% decrease in the fair value of investments held directly and through consolidated investment funds generally would result in a commensurate change in the amount of net gains (losses) from investment activities for investments held directly and through investment funds and a more significant impact to the amount of table of contents carried interest recognized, regardless of whether the investment was valued using observable market prices or management estimates with significant unobservable pricing inputs. with respect to consolidated investment funds, the impact that the consequential decrease in investment income would have on net income attributable to kkr would generally be significantly less than the amount described above, given that a majority of the change in fair value of our consolidated funds would be attributable to noncontrolling interests and therefore we are only impacted to the extent of our carried interest and our balance sheet investments. with respect to insurance, a decrease in investment income for certain assets where investment gains and losses are recognized through the statement of operations would impact kkr only to the extent of our economic ownership interest in global atlantic. as of december 31, 2022, there were no investments which represented greater than 5% of total investments on a gaap basis. on a non-gaap basis, as of december 31, 2022, investments which represented greater than 5% of total non-gaap investments consisted of usi, inc. and petvet care centers, llc and valued at $1,300 million and $1,143 million, respectively. our investment income on a gaap basis and our book value can be impacted by volatility in the public markets related to our holdings of publicly traded securities, including our sizable holdings of crescent energy. see \"-business environment\" for a discussion of factors that may impact the valuations of our investments, financial results, operating results and valuations, and \"-non-gaap balance sheet measures\" for additional information regarding our largest holdings on a non-gaap basis. business combinations kkr accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, under which the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using the fair values determined by management as of the acquisition date. management's determination of fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date is based on the best information available in the circumstances and may incorporate management's own assumptions and involve a significant degree of judgment. we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful lives of those acquired intangible assets. examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include, but are not limited to, future expected cash inflows and outflows, future fundraising assumptions, expected useful life, discount rates and income tax rates. our estimates for future cash flows are based on historical data, various internal estimates and certain external sources, and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying assets acquired. we estimate the useful lives of the intangible assets based on the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefit from the asset. we base our estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual result. income taxes significant judgment is required in estimating the provision for (benefit from) income taxes, current and deferred tax balances (including valuation allowance), accrued interest or penalties and uncertain tax positions. in evaluating these judgments, we consider, among other items, projections of taxable income (including the character of such income), beginning with historic results and incorporating assumptions of the amount of future pretax operating income. these assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates that kkr uses to manage its business. as of december 31, 2022, a portion of the deferred tax assets are not considered to be more likely than not to be realized. for that portion of the deferred tax assets for global atlantic, a valuation allowance has been recorded. revisions in estimates and/or actual costs of a tax assessment may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, if any. please see note 19 \"income taxes\" in our financial statements in this report for further details. critical accounting policies and estimates - asset management revenues fees and other fees and other consist primarily of (i) management and incentive fees from providing investment management services to unconsolidated funds, clos, other vehicles, and separately managed accounts; (ii) transaction fees earned in connection with successful investment transactions and from capital markets activities; (iii) monitoring fees from providing services to portfolio companies; (iv) expense reimbursements from certain investment funds and portfolio companies; and (v) consulting fees. these table of contents fees are based on the contractual terms of the governing agreements and are recognized when earned, which coincides with the period during which the related services are performed and in the case of transaction fees, upon closing of the transaction. monitoring fees may provide for a termination payment following an initial public offering or change of control. these termination payments are recognized in the period when the related transaction closes. transaction fee calculations and management fee calculations based on committed capital or invested capital typically do not require discretion and therefore do not require the use of significant estimates or judgments. management fee calculations based on net asset value depend on the fair value of the underlying investments within the investment vehicles. estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds and could vary depending on the valuation methodology that is used as well as economic conditions. capital allocation-based income (loss) capital allocation-based income (loss) is earned from those arrangements whereby kkr serves as general partner and includes income or loss from kkr's capital interest as well as \"carried interest\" which entitles kkr to a disproportionate allocation of investment income or loss from an investment fund's limited partners. carried interest is recognized upon appreciation of the funds' investment values above certain return hurdles set forth in their partnership agreement. kkr recognizes revenues attributable to capital allocation-based income based upon the amount that would be due pursuant to the fund partnership agreement at each period end as if the funds were terminated at that date. accordingly, the amount recognized reflects kkr's share of the gains and losses of the associated funds' underlying investments measured at their then-current fair values relative to the fair values as of the end of the prior period. because of the inherent uncertainty in measuring the fair value of investments in the absence of observable market prices as previously discussed, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material. expenses compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expense includes (i) base cash compensation consisting of salaries and wages, (ii) benefits, (iii) carry pool allocations, (iv) equity-based compensation and (v) discretionary cash bonuses. to supplement base cash compensation, benefits, carry pool allocations, and equity-based compensation, we typically pay discretionary cash bonuses, which are included in compensation and benefits expense in the consolidated statements of operations, based principally on the level of (i) management fees and other fee revenues (including incentive fees), (ii) realized carried interest and (iii) realized investment income earned during the year. the amounts paid as discretionary cash bonuses, if any, are at our sole discretion and vary from individual to individual and from period to period, including having no cash bonus. we accrue discretionary cash bonuses when payment becomes probable and reasonably estimable which is generally in the period when we make the decision to pay discretionary cash bonuses and is based upon a number of factors, including the recognition of fee revenues, realized carried interest, realized investment income and other factors determined during the year. beginning in 2021, we expect to pay our employees by assigning a percentage range to each component of asset management segment revenues. based on the current components and blend of our asset management segment revenues on an annual basis, we expect to use approximately: (i) 20‐25% of fee related revenues, (ii) 60‐70% of realized carried interest and incentive fees not included in fee related performance revenues or earned from our hedge fund partnerships, and (iii) 10‐20% of realized investment income and hedge fund partnership incentive fees to pay our asset management employees. because these ranges are applied to applicable asset management segment revenue components independently, and on an annual basis, the amount paid as a percentage of total asset management segment revenue will vary and will, for example, likely be higher in a period with relatively higher realized carried interest and lower in a period with relatively lower realized carried interest. we decide whether to pay a discretionary cash bonus and determine the percentage of applicable revenue components to pay compensation only upon the occurrence of the realization event. there is no contractual or other binding obligation that requires us to pay a discretionary cash bonus to the asset management employees, except in limited circumstances. assuming that we had accrued compensation of (i) 65% of the unrealized carried interest earned by the funds that allocate 40% and 43% to the carry pool and (ii) 15% of the unrealized net gains in our principal activities business line (in each case at the mid-point of the ranges above), kkr & co. inc. stockholders' equity - common stock as of december 31, 2022 would have been reduced by approximately $1.46 per share, compared to our reported $19.29 per share on such date, and our book value as of december 31, 2022 would have been reduced by approximately $1.42 per adjusted share, compared to our reported book value of $26.73 per adjusted share on such date. table of contents carry pool allocation with respect to our funds that provide for carried interest, we allocate a portion of the realized and unrealized carried interest that we earn to a carry pool established at kkr associates holdings l.p., which is not a kkr subsidiary, from which our asset management employees and certain other carry pool participants are eligible to receive a carried interest allocation. the allocation is determined based upon a fixed arrangement between kkr associates holdings and us, and we do not exercise discretion on whether to make an allocation to the carry pool upon a realization event. these amounts are accounted for as compensatory profit sharing arrangements in accrued expenses and other liabilities within the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition in conjunction with the related carried interest income and are recorded as compensation expense. upon a reversal of carried interest income, the related carry pool allocation, if any, is also reversed. accordingly, such compensation expense is subject to both positive and negative adjustments. in february 2021, with the approval of a majority of our independent directors, kkr amended the percentage of carried interest that is allocable to the carry pool to 65% for (i) current investment funds for which no or de minimis amounts of carried interest was accrued as of december 31, 2020 and (ii) all future funds. for all other funds, the percentage of carried interest remains 40% or 43%, as applicable. the percentage of carried interest allocable to the carry pool may be increased above 65% only with the approval of a majority of our independent directors. to account for the difference in the carry pool allocation percentages, we expect to use a portion of realized carried interest from the older funds equal to the difference between 65% and 40% or 43%, as applicable, to supplement the carry pool and to pay amounts as discretionary cash bonus compensation as described above to our asset management employees. the amounts paid as discretionary cash bonuses, if any, are at our discretion and vary from individual to individual and from period to period, including having no cash bonus at all for certain employees. see \"-revenues-capital allocation-based income (loss)\" and \"-compensation and benefits\" above. on the sunset date (which will not be later than december 31, 2026), kkr will acquire control of kkr associates holdings and will commence making decisions regarding the allocation of carry proceeds pursuant to the limited partnership agreement of kkr associates holdings. until the sunset date, our co-founders will continue to make decisions regarding the allocation of carry proceeds to themselves and others, pursuant to the limited partnership agreement of kkr associates holdings, provided that any allocation of carry proceeds to the co-founders will be on a percentage basis consistent with past practice. for additional information about the sunset date and the reorganization agreement, please see \"certain relationships and related transactions, and director independence\" in this report. equity-based compensation in addition to the cash-based compensation and carry pool allocations as described above, employees receive equity awards under our equity incentive plans, most of which are subject to service-based vesting typically over a three to five-year period from the date of grant, and some of which are also subject to the achievement of market-based conditions. certain of these awards are subject to post-vesting transfer restrictions and minimum retained ownership requirements. compensation expense relating to the issuance of equity-based awards is measured at fair value on the grant date. in determining the aggregate fair value of any award grants, we make judgments as to the grant-date fair value, particularly for certain restricted units with a vesting condition based upon market conditions, whose grant date fair values are based on a probability distributed monte-carlo simulation. see note 20 \"equity based compensation,\" in our financial statements included in this report for further discussion and activity of these awards. investment income (loss) -net gains (losses) from investment activities net gains (losses) from investment activities consist of realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from our investment activities as well as income earned from certain equity method investments. fluctuations in net gains (losses) from investment activities between reporting periods is driven primarily by changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as well as the realization of investments. the fair value of, as well as the ability to recognize gains from, our investments is significantly impacted by the global financial markets, which, in turn, affects the net gains (losses) from investment activities recognized in any given period. upon the disposition of an investment, previously recognized unrealized gains and losses are reversed and an offsetting realized gain or loss is recognized in the current period. since our investments are carried at fair value, fluctuations between periods could be significant due to changes to the inputs to our valuation process over time. for a further discussion of our fair value measurements and fair value of investments, see the above \"-critical accounting policies and estimates-fair value measurements.\" table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates - insurance policy liabilities policy liabilities (collectively, \"reserves,\") are the portion of past premiums or assessments received that are set aside to meet future policy and contract obligations as they become due. interest accrues on the reserves and on future premiums, which may also be available to pay for future obligations. global atlantic establishes reserves to pay future policy benefits, claims, and certain expenses for its life policies and annuity contracts. global atlantic's reserves are estimated based on models that include many actuarial assumptions and projections. these assumptions and projections, which are inherently uncertain, involve significant judgment, including assumptions as to the levels and/or timing of premiums, benefits, claims, expenses, interest credits, investment results (including equity market returns), credit spreads, mortality, longevity, and persistency. the assumptions on which reserves are based are intended to represent an estimation of experience for the period that policy benefits are payable. global atlantic reviews the adequacy of its reserves and the assumptions underlying those reserves at least annually. global atlantic cannot, however, determine with precision the amount or the timing of actual benefit payments. if actual experience is better than or equal to the assumptions, then reserves would be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses. if experience is worse than the assumptions, additional reserves may be required to meet future policy and contract obligations. this would result in a charge to our net income during the period in which excess benefits are paid or an increase in reserves occurs. for a majority of global atlantic's in-force policies, including its universal life policies and most annuity contracts, the base policy reserve is equal to the account value. for these products, the account value represents its obligation to repay to the policyholder the amounts held on deposit. however, there are several significant blocks of business where policy reserves, in addition to the account value, are explicitly calculated, including variable annuities, fixed-indexed annuities, universal life products with secondary guarantees, indexed universal life and preneed policies. guaranteed minimum death benefits (\"gmdb\") some of global atlantic's variable annuity and fixed-indexed annuity contracts contain a gmdb feature that provides a guarantee that the benefit received at death will be no less than a prescribed minimum amount, even if the account balance is reduced to zero. this amount is based on either the net deposits paid into the contract, the net deposits accumulated at a specified rate, the highest historical account value on a contract anniversary, or sometimes a combination of these values. if the gmdb is higher than the current account value at the time of death, global atlantic incurs a cost equal to the difference. guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (\"gmwb\") global atlantic issues fixed-indexed annuity and variable annuity contracts with a guaranteed minimum withdrawal feature. gmwb are an optional benefit where the contract owner is entitled to withdraw a maximum amount of their benefit base each year. once exercised, living benefit features provide annuity policyholders with a minimum guaranteed stream of income for life. a policyholder's annual income benefit is generally based on an annual withdrawal percentage multiplied by the benefit base. the benefit base is defined in the policy and is generally the initial premium, reduced by any partial withdrawals and increased by a defined percentage, formula or index credits. any living benefit payments are first deducted from the account value. global atlantic is responsible for paying any excess guaranteed living benefits still owed after the account value has reached zero. the ultimate cost of these benefits will depend on the level of market returns and the level of contractual guarantees, as well as policyholder behavior, including surrenders, withdrawals, and benefit utilization. for fixed-indexed annuity products, costs also include certain non-guaranteed terms that impact the ultimate cost, such as caps on crediting rates that global atlantic can, in its discretion, reset annually. table of contents gmdb and gmwb sensitivities as of december 31, 2022, the gmdb and gmwb liability balance totaled $1.3 billion. as of december 31, 2022, the liability balances for gmdb were $36.0 million for fixed-indexed annuities and $33.8 million for variable annuities. as of december 31, 2022, the liability balances for gmwb were $1.2 billion for fixed-indexed annuities. the increase (decrease) to the gmdb and gmwb liability balance as a result of hypothetical changes in projected assessments, equity market prices, and annual equity growth is summarized in the table below. this sensitivity considers the direct effect of such changes only and not changes in any other assumptions used in or items considered in the measurement of such balances. december 31, 2022 ($ in thousands) balance $1,252,206 hypothetical change: '+10% future assessments(1) (27,887) '-10% future assessments(1) 31,696 +10% equity market prices (18,298) -10% equity market prices 9,730 1% lower annual equity growth 4,918 ________________ note: hypothetical changes to the liability balance do not reflect the impact of related hedges. (1)the assessments used to accrue liabilities are generally based on investment yields, realized gains and losses, rider charges, surrender charges, and asset-based fees, such as mortality and expense fees. embedded derivatives global atlantic's fixed-indexed annuity, variable annuity and indexed universal life products contain equity-indexed features, which are considered embedded derivatives and are required to be measured at fair value. the embedded derivative is calculated as the present value of future projected benefits in excess of the projected guaranteed benefits, using an option budget as the indexed account value growth rate. in addition, the fair value of the embedded derivative is reduced to reflect the risk of non-performance on global atlantic's obligations (i.e., own credit risk). changes in interest rates, future index credits, global atlantic's own credit risk, projected withdrawal and surrender activity, and mortality on fixed-indexed annuity and indexed universal life contracts can have a significant impact on the value of the embedded derivative. valuation of embedded derivatives - fixed-indexed annuities fixed-indexed annuity contracts allow the policyholder to elect a fixed interest rate of return or a market indexed strategy where interest credited is based on the performance of an index, such as the s&p 500 index, or other indexes. the market indexed strategy is an embedded derivative, similar to a call option. the fair value of the embedded derivative is computed as the present value of benefits attributable to the excess of the projected policy contract values over the projected minimum guaranteed contract values. the projections of policy contract values are based on assumptions for future policy growth, which include assumptions for expected index credits, future equity option costs, volatility, interest rates, and policyholder behavior. the projections of minimum guaranteed contract values include the same assumptions for policyholder behavior as are used to project policy contract values. the embedded derivative cash flows are discounted using a risk-free interest rate adjusted by a non-performance risk spread tied to global atlantic's own credit rating. table of contents valuation of embedded derivatives - indexed universal life indexed universal life products allow a policyholder's account value to grow based on the performance of certain equity indexes, which result in an embedded derivative similar to a call option. the embedded derivative related to the index is bifurcated from the host contract and measured at fair value. the valuation of the embedded derivative is the present value of future projected benefits in excess of the projected guaranteed benefits, using the option budget as the indexed account value growth rate and the guaranteed interest rate as the guaranteed account value growth rate. present values are based on discount rate curves determined at the valuation or issue date as well as assumed lapse and mortality rates. the discount rate equals the forecast treasury rate plus a non-performance risk spread tied to global atlantic's own credit rating. changes in discount rates and other assumptions such as spreads and/or option budgets can have a substantial impact on the embedded derivative. valuation of embedded derivatives - variable annuities variable annuity contracts offered and assumed by global atlantic provide the contractholder with gmdb and/or gmwb. the liabilities for these benefits are included in policy liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial condition. the change in the liabilities for these benefits is included in policy benefits and claims in the consolidated statements of operation. global atlantic has issued variable annuity contracts with gmdb features. global atlantic elected the fair value option to measure the liability for certain of these variable annuity contracts, valued at $394.6 million as of december 31, 2022. fair value is calculated as the present value of the estimated death benefits less the present value of the gmdb fees, using 1,000 risk neutral scenarios. global atlantic discounts the cash flows using u.s. treasury rates plus an adjustment for its own credit risk. global atlantic also issues variable annuity contracts with a gmwb. the gmwb feature represents an embedded derivative. the embedded derivative is required to be bifurcated and measured at fair value. this liability is calculated as the present value of the excess gmwb claims less the present value of gmwb fees, using 1,000 risk neutral scenarios. global atlantic discounts the cash flows using u.s. treasury rates plus an adjustment for its own company credit risk. as of december 31, 2022, the embedded derivative liability balance totaled $1.9 billion for fixed-indexed annuities, $337.9 million for indexed universal life and $2.3 million for variable annuities. as of december 31, 2022, variable annuities accounted for using the fair value option was $394.6 million. the increase (decrease) to the embedded derivatives on fixed-indexed annuity, indexed universal life, and variable annuity products and the increase (decrease) in the reserves for variable annuities accounted for using the fair value option as a result of hypothetical changes in interest rates, non-performance risk premium, and equity market prices is summarized in the table below. this sensitivity considers the direct effect of such changes only and not changes in any other assumptions used

the liability balances do not reflect the impact of related hedges. valuation of embedded derivatives in modified coinsurance or funds withheld global atlantic's reinsurance agreements include modified coinsurance and coinsurance with funds withheld arrangements that include terms that require payment by the ceding company of a principal amount plus a return that is based on a proportion of the ceding company's return on a designated portfolio of assets. because the return on the funds withheld receivable or payable is not clearly and closely related to the host insurance contract, these contracts are deemed to contain embedded table of contents derivatives, which are measured at fair value. global atlantic is exposed to both the interest rate and credit risk of the assets. changes in discount rates and other assumptions can have a significant impact on this embedded derivative. the fair value of the embedded derivatives is included in the funds withheld receivable at interest and funds withheld payable at interest line items on the consolidated statement of financial condition. the change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives is recorded in net investment-related gains (losses) in the consolidated statement of operations. as of december 31, 2022, the embedded derivative balance for modified coinsurance or funds withheld arrangements was a $3,500 million net asset ($12.8 million in funds withheld receivables at interest, and $(3,487.8) million in funds withheld payable at interest). the increase (decrease) to the balance as a result of hypothetical changes in credit spreads and interest rates is summarized in the table below. this sensitivity considers the direct effect of such changes only and not changes in any other factors that impact the embedded

organizational resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” (vogus & sutcliffe, 2007: 3418). organizational resilience is defined as the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity. resilience can be defined as the system’s ability to maintain its integrity and its performance, at least partially, while under internal or external variations and disturbances (i.e. pressures, constraints, failures, errors, violations, hazards), whether nominal, extreme, or exceptional. defined as a company’s ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from a challenging situation. we develop a trajectory model of organizational resilience that focuses on how actors project temporal trajectories of responses toward disruptive events, reconstitute the trajectories in immediate response to the event, and reconfigure the trajectories toward the ensuing future. the concept of resilience draws attention to systems as well as individuals, to partial maintenance of integrity and performance, to the opposite of brittleness, and to disturbances that vary both in scale and source. resilience is a multifaceted concept that reflects businesses’ ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change to survive, grow, and flourish.\"\"\"\n\n    Text:\n    \"\"\"item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (\"md&a\") is intended to help the reader understand the coca-cola company, our operations and our present business environment. md&a is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in \"item 8. financial statements and supplementary data\" of this report. md&a includes the following sections: •our business - a general description of our business and its challenges and risks. •critical accounting policies and estimates - a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates. •operations review - an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for 2022 and 2021 and year-to-year comparisons between

10-k for the year ended december 31, 2021. •liquidity, capital resources and financial position - an analysis of cash flows, contractual obligations, foreign exchange, and the impact of inflation and changing prices. our business general the coca-cola company is a total beverage company, and beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the united states since 1886, are now sold in more than 200 countries and territories. we own or license and market numerous beverage brands, which we group into the following categories: trademark coca-cola; sparkling flavors; water, sports, coffee and tea; juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages; and emerging beverages. we own and market five of the world's top six nonalcoholic sparkling soft drink brands: coca-cola, sprite, fanta, coca-cola zero sugar and diet coke/coca-cola light. we make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers as well as the company's consolidated bottling and distribution operations. beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for 2.2 billion of the estimated 64 billion servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day. we believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of beverage options to meet their desires, needs and lifestyles. our success further depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day. our company markets, manufactures and sells: •beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as \"beverage bases,\" and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our \"concentrate operations\"); and •finished sparkling soft drinks and other beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our \"finished product operations\"). generally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations. our concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates, syrups and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which we typically refer as our \"bottlers\" or our \"bottling partners\"). our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the product), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. the finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through wholesalers or other bottlers. in addition, outside the united states, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which they sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our global ventures operating segment. our finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished beverages to retailers, or to distributors and wholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. these operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our bottling investments operating segment. in certain markets, the company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to distributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the company's bottling partners. these operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments or our global ventures operating segment. additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by costa. these sales are included in our global ventures operating segment. in the united states, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. these fountain syrup sales are included in our north america operating segment. the following table sets forth the percentage of total net operating revenues attributable to concentrate operations and finished product operations: year ended december 31, 2022 2021 concentrate operations 56 % 56 % finished product operations 44 44 total 100 % 100 % the following table sets forth the percentage of total worldwide unit case volume attributable to concentrate operations and finished product operations: year ended december 31, 2022 2021 concentrate operations 82 % 83 % finished product operations 18 17 total 100 % 100 % we operate in the highly competitive commercial beverage industry. we face strong competition from numerous other general and specialty beverage companies. we, along with other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending, economic conditions, availability and quality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, geopolitical conditions, local and national laws and regulations, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, fuel prices, weather patterns and the covid-19 pandemic. on march 8, 2022, the company announced the suspension of its business in russia as a result of the conflict between russia and ukraine. in addition, the conflict has caused a disruption of our business in ukraine. the company will continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve. as a point of reference, in 2021, the company's business in russia and ukraine contributed 2 percent of the company's unit case volume and 1 percent and 2 percent of the company's consolidated net operating revenues and operating income, respectively. throughout 2022, the effects of the covid-19 pandemic, including the resurgence of the virus in certain countries and the related actions by governments to attempt to contain the spread of the virus, continued to negatively impact our business. while uncertainties caused by the covid-19 pandemic remain, and factors such as the state of the supply chain, labor shortages and the inflationary environment are likely to impact the pace of the economic recovery, we are focused on executing for growth. despite the dynamic world in which we are currently operating, we believe we are well positioned to create value for our company and our stakeholders. in an effort to support our future growth, we are continuing to invest in our portfolio of brands, our strategic capabilities and our people. we are focused on the following strategic priorities: unlocking the potential of our portfolio of strong global, regional and scaled local brands; developing a robust innovation pipeline focusing on scalable initiatives; increasing consumer-centric marketing effectiveness and efficiency; winning in the marketplace with aligned data-driven revenue growth management and execution capabilities; and further embedding sustainability goals into our operations. challenges and risks being a global enterprise provides unique opportunities for our company. challenges and risks accompany those opportunities. our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of our company and the commercial beverage industry. of these, five key challenges and risks are discussed below. obesity obesity continues to impact communities and countries worldwide. there is growing concern among consumers, public health professionals and governments about the health problems associated with obesity. this concern represents a significant challenge to our industry. we understand that obesity is a complex public health challenge, and we are committed to being a part of the solution. we recognize the uniqueness of consumers' lifestyles and dietary choices. therefore, we continue to: •offer an expanded portfolio of beverage choices, including reduced-, low- and no-calorie beverage options; •provide transparent nutrition information, featuring calories on the front of most of our packages; •provide our beverages in a range of packaging sizes, including small sizes to enable portion control; and •market responsibly, including no advertising targeted to children under 13. the heritage of our company is to lead, and innovation is critical for leadership. as such, we are resolute in continuing to innovate and are committed to partnering to find winning solutions in the area of noncaloric sweeteners. this includes working to reduce sugar and calories in many of our beverages. we want to be a helpful and credible partner in the fight against obesity. across the coca-cola system, we are mobilizing our assets in marketing and in community outreach to increase awareness and spur action. evolving consumer product preferences we are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs, on-the-go lifestyles and consumers who are empowered with more information than ever. as a consequence of these changes, many consumers want more beverage choices, personalization, a focus on sustainability, and transparency related to our products and packaging. we are committed to meeting changing consumer needs and to generating growth through our evolving portfolio of beverage brands and products (including numerous low- and no-calorie products); selectively expanding into other profitable categories of the commercial beverage industry; innovative and sustainable packaging; and ingredient education efforts. evolving competitive landscape and competing in the digital marketplace our company faces strong competition from well-established global companies as well as numerous regional and local companies. additionally, the rapidly evolving digital landscape and growth of e-commerce in many markets has led to dramatic shifts in consumer shopping habits and patterns. consumers are rapidly embracing shopping via mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms, which presents new challenges to maintain the competitiveness and relevancy of our brands. as a result, we must continuously strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation to compete in a digital environment and maintain brand loyalty and market share. in addition, we are increasing our investments in e-commerce to support retail and meal delivery services, offering more package sizes that are fit-for-purpose for online sales, and shifting more consumer and trade promotions to digital. product safety and quality we strive to meet the highest standards in both product safety and product quality. we are aware that some consumers have concerns and negative viewpoints regarding certain ingredients used in our products. the coca-cola system works every day to produce high quality, safe and refreshing beverages for consumers around the world. we have rigorous product and ingredient safety and quality standards designed to ensure safety and quality in each of our products, and we drive innovation that provides new beverage options to satisfy consumers' evolving needs and preferences. we work to ensure consistent safety and quality through strong governance and compliance with applicable regulations and standards. we stay current with new regulations, industry best practices and marketplace conditions, and we engage with standard-setting and industry organizations. additionally, we manufacture and distribute our products according to strict policies, requirements and specifications set forth in an integrated quality management program that continually measures all operations within the coca-cola system against the same stringent standards. our quality management program also identifies and mitigates risks and drives improvement. in our quality laboratories, we stringently measure the quality attributes of ingredients as well as samples of finished products collected from the marketplace. we perform due diligence to ensure that product and ingredient safety and quality standards are maintained in the more than 200 countries and territories where our products are sold. we regularly assess the relevance of our requirements and standards and continually work to improve and refine them across our entire supply chain. sustainability matters as investors and stakeholders increasingly focus on sustainability matters, our company and companies across all industries are facing challenges and risks related to, among other things, sustainable packaging; water stewardship; climate; health and nutrition; human rights; and diversity, equity and inclusion. where these challenges and risks relate to our business, we acknowledge that we have a role to play in developing and implementing solutions related to these important challenges. we have established specific sustainability focus areas: water quality and scarcity; packaging materials used for our products; reduction of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions; sustainable sourcing of agricultural commodities; diversity, equity and inclusion; and human and workplace rights. our ability to achieve our sustainability goals is dependent on many factors, including, but not limited to, our actions along with the actions of various stakeholders, such as our bottling partners, suppliers, governments, nongovernmental organizations, communities, and other third parties, all of which are outside of our control. see \"item 1a. risk factors\" in part i of this report for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our company. critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (\"u.s. gaap\"), which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. we believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following: •principles of consolidation •recoverability of current and noncurrent assets •pension plan valuations •revenue recognition •income taxes management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our company's board of directors. while our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and on actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. for a discussion of the company's significant accounting policies, refer to note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements. principles of consolidation our company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. additionally, there are situations in which consolidation is required even though the usual condition of consolidation (i.e., ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business enterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entity's voting interests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. this disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest, and the entity in which another entity holds a variable interest is referred to as a \"vie.\" an enterprise must consolidate a vie if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie. the primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie. our company holds interests in certain vies, primarily bottling operations, for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary. our variable interests in these vies primarily relate to equity investments, profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. refer to note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements. although these financial arrangements resulted in our holding variable interests in these entities, they did not empower us to direct the activities of the vies that most significantly impact the vies' economic performance. creditors of our vies do not have recourse against the general credit of the company, regardless of whether the vies are accounted for as consolidated entities. we use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. our consolidated net income includes our company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investee includes considering key factors, such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intercompany transactions. we eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with consolidated vies and the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees. recoverability of current and noncurrent assets our company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the countries and territories in which we operate, particularly in developing and emerging markets. refer to the heading \"our business - challenges and risks\" above and \"item 1a. risk factors\" in part i of this report. as a result, management must make numerous assumptions, which involve a significant amount of judgment, when performing recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets in various regions around the world. we perform recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets in accordance with u.s. gaap. for certain assets, recoverability and/or impairment tests are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. for other assets, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. the performance of recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets involves critical accounting estimates. these estimates require significant management judgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. factors that management must estimate include, among others, the economic lives of the assets, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, the impact of any supply chain disruptions, inflation, long-term growth rates, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending, proceeds from the sale of assets and customers' financial condition. the variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. these factors are even more difficult to estimate as a result of uncertainties associated with the scope, severity and duration of the global covid-19 pandemic. the estimates we use when performing recoverability tests of assets are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. when performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using management's best assumptions, which we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. the company has certain intangible and other long-lived assets that are more dependent on cash flows generated in away-from-home channels and/or that generate cash flows in geographic areas which are more heavily impacted by the covid-19 pandemic, and therefore these assets are more susceptible to impairment. in addition, intangible and other long-lived assets we acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, because they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions at the time of acquisition. if we had used other assumptions and estimates when impairment tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. furthermore, if management uses different assumptions in future periods, or if different conditions exist in future periods, impairment charges could result. the total future impairment charges we may be required to record could be material. refer to note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent acquisitions. refer to note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements for the discussion of impairment charges. refer to the heading \"operations review\" below for additional information related to our present business environment. as of december 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investment in coca-cola bottlers japan holdings inc. (\"ccbjhi\") exceeded its fair value by $29 million, or 8 percent. based on the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than our carrying value and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, management determined that the decline in fair value was temporary in nature. therefore, we did not record an impairment charge related to the investment. our equity method investees also perform such recoverability and impairment tests. if an impairment charge is recorded by one of our equity method investees, the company records its proportionate share of such charge as a reduction of equity income (loss) - net in our consolidated statement of income. however, the actual amount we record with respect to our proportionate share of such charge may be impacted by items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains. investments in equity and debt securities we measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. we use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of equity securities with readily determinable fair values. for equity securities without readily determinable fair values, we have elected the measurement alternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. management assesses each of these investments on an individual basis. our investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. the cost basis is determined by the specific identification method. investments in debt securities that the company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are included in net income. unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale debt securities are included in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), except for the changes in fair values attributable to the currency risk being hedged, if applicable, which are included in net income. equity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method and debt securities classified as trading are not assessed for impairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. equity method investments, equity securities without readily determinable fair values and debt securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity are reviewed each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. when such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment. we also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value. the fair values of most of our company's investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. for investments in nonpublicly traded companies, management's assessment of fair value is based on various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds, and appraisals, as appropriate. we consider the assumptions that we believe a market participant would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. the ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the determination of fair value. in the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. if management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. property, plant and equipment certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount or remaining useful life of property, plant and equipment should be assessed, including, among others, the manner or length of time in which the company intends to use the asset, a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses and/or projected future losses. when such events or changes in circumstances are present and a recoverability test is performed, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. these estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. if the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. the impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. we use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment, including appraisals and discounted cash flow models. these appraisals and models include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. goodwill, trademarks and other intangible assets intangible assets are classified into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. for intangible assets with definite lives, recoverability tests must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. for intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill, impairment tests must be performed at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. the performance of recoverability and impairment tests of intangible assets involves critical accounting estimates. these estimates require significant management judgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. factors that management must estimate include, among others, the economic lives of the assets, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, the impact of any supply chain disruptions, inflation, long-term growth rates, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending, proceeds from the sale of assets and customers' financial condition. these factors are even more difficult to predict when global financial markets are highly volatile. the estimates we use when performing recoverability tests of intangible assets are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. when performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using management's best assumptions, which we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. the estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate. the variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. if other assumptions and estimates had been used when these tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. as mentioned above, these factors do not change in isolation and, therefore, we do not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor. furthermore, if management uses different assumptions in future periods or if different conditions exist in future periods, impairment charges could result. refer to the heading \"operations review\" below for additional information related to our present business environment. intangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, because they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition. consequently, if operating results and/or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets. a deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital and/or discount rates. additionally, we are required to ensure that the assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions that we believe a market participant would use. as a result, the cost of capital and/or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends, regardless of whether our company's actual cost of capital has changed. therefore, if the cost of capital and/or discount rates change, our company may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are equal to, or greater than, our previously forecasted amounts. we perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is generally one level below our operating segments. our operating segments are primarily based on geographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. our geographic operating segments are generally subdivided into smaller geographic regions. these geographic regions are our reporting units. our global ventures operating segment includes the results of our costa, innocent and doğadan businesses, as well as fees earned pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the company and monster, each of which is its own reporting unit. the bottling investments operating segment includes all of our consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location. generally, each consolidated bottling operation within our bottling investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination. in order to test for goodwill impairment, the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. however, the impairment charge recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. we typically use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. the assumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe a market participant would use. the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill rather than completing the impairment test. the company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if the company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing discussed above. otherwise, the company does not need to perform any further assessment. when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, management performs a recoverability test of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. these estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. if the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, we recognize an impairment charge. the impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. we use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models. these models include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. we test indefinite-lived intangible assets, including trademarks, franchise rights and goodwill, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. our company performs these annual impairment tests as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. we use a variety of methodologies in conducting impairment tests of indefinite-lived intangible assets, including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models. these models include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. for indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, rather than completing the impairment test. the company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. if the company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing described above. otherwise, the company does not need to perform any further assessment. pension plan valuations our company sponsors a qualified pension plan covering substantially all u.s. employees as well as unfunded nonqualified pension plans for certain employees in the united states. in addition, our company and its subsidiaries have various pension plans outside the united states. management is required to make certain critical estimates related to the actuarial assumptions used to determine our pension obligations and our net periodic pension cost or income. we believe the two most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. our actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, or more frequently to the extent that a settlement or curtailment occurs. changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension obligations and our net periodic pension cost or income. the discount rate assumption used to account for pension plans reflects the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. the discount rate for u.s. and certain non-u.s. plans is determined using a matching technique whereby the rates of a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities, are applied to projected benefit cash flows to determine the appropriate effective discount rate. for other non-u.s. plans, we base the discount rate assumption on comparable indices within each of the respective countries. the company measures the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost or income by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans' projected cash flows. the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the long-term outlook of our investment strategy as well as our historical returns and volatilities for each asset class. we also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. our investment objective for our pension assets is to ensure all funded pension plans have sufficient assets to meet their benefit obligations when they become due. as a result, the company periodically revises asset allocations, where appropriate, to seek to improve returns and manage risk. in 2022, the company's net periodic pension income was $124 million. in 2023, we expect our net periodic pension cost to be approximately $40 million. the primary driver of this change is the unfavorable performance of plan assets in 2022, partially offset by the net impact of the increase in the weighted-average discount rate at december 31, 2022 compared to december 31, 2021. as of december 31, 2022, the u.s. qualified pension plan represented 64 percent and 61 percent of the company's consolidated projected benefit obligation and pension plan assets, respectively. for this plan, we estimate that a 50 basis-point decrease in the discount rate would result in a $13 million increase in our 2023 net periodic pension cost, and we estimate that a 50 basis-point decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would result in a $21 million increase in our 2023 net periodic pension cost. refer to note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about our pension plans and related actuarial assumptions. revenue recognition revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers are satisfied. our performance obligation generally consists of the promise to sell concentrates, syrups or finished products to our bottling partners, wholesalers, distributors or retailers. control of the concentrates, syrups or finished products is transferred upon shipment to, or receipt at, our customers' locations, as determined by the specific terms of the contract. upon transfer of control to the customer, which completes our performance obligation, revenue is recognized. our sales terms generally do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part. after completion of our performance obligation, we have an unconditional right to consideration as outlined in the contract. our receivables will generally be collected in less than six months, in accordance with the underlying payment terms. all of our performance obligations under the terms of contracts with our customers have an original duration of one year or less. our customers and bottling partners may be entitled to cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume‐based incentive programs, support for infrastructure programs, and other similar programs. in most markets, in an effort to allow our company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers' always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model. under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix. the amounts associated with the arrangements described above represent variable consideration, an estimate of which is included in the transaction price as a component of net operating revenues in our consolidated statement of income upon completion of our performance obligations. the total revenue recorded, including any variable consideration, cannot exceed the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur when uncertainties related to variability are resolved. as a result, we are recognizing revenue based on our faithful depiction of the consideration that we expect to receive. in making our estimates of variable consideration, we consider past results and make significant assumptions related to: (1) customer sales volumes; (2) customer ending inventories; (3) customer selling price per unit; (4) selling channels; and (5) discount rates, rebates and other pricing allowances, as applicable. in gathering data to estimate our variable consideration, we generally calculate our estimates using a portfolio approach at the country and product line level rather than at the individual contract level. the result of making these estimates will impact the line items trade accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet. the actual amounts ultimately paid and/or received may be different from our estimates. income taxes our annual effective tax rate is based on our income and the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. significant judgment is required in determining our annual income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. we establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the position becomes uncertain based upon one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is not \"more likely than not\" to be sustained; (2) the tax position is \"more likely than not\" to be sustained, but for a lesser amount; or (3) the tax position is \"more likely than not\" to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken. for purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain, (1) we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information; (2) the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings and caselaw and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position; and (3) each tax position is evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken. we adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. refer to the heading \"operations review - income taxes\" below and note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements. a number of years may elapse before a particular uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. the number of years subject to tax audits or tax assessments varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. the tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the \"more likely than not\" recognition threshold would be recognized in income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is \"more likely than not\" to be sustained; (2) the tax position, amount and/or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation; or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. refer to note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements. tax laws require certain items to be included in the tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements. as a result, the annual effective tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different from that reported in our tax return (our cash tax rate). some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities. the tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year and for the manner in which the differences are expected to reverse. based on the evaluation of all available information, the company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not. we evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results; the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences; taxable income in prior carryback years (if permitted); and the availability of tax planning strategies. a valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the company will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset. the company does not record a u.s. deferred tax liability for the excess of the book basis over the tax basis of its investments in foreign subsidiaries to the extent that the basis difference meets the indefinite reversal criteria. these criteria are met if the foreign subsidiary has invested, or will invest, the undistributed earnings indefinitely. the decision as to the amount of undistributed earnings that the company intends to maintain in non-u.s. subsidiaries takes into account various items, including, but not limited to, forecasts and budgets of financial needs of cash for working capital, liquidity plans, capital improvement programs, merger and acquisition plans, and planned loans to other non-u.s. subsidiaries. the company also evaluates its expected cash requirements in the united states. other factors that can influence that determination are local restrictions on remittances (for example, in some countries a central bank application and approval are required in order for the company's local country subsidiary to pay a dividend), economic stability and asset risk. refer to note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements. operations review our organizational structure consists of the following operating segments: europe, middle east and africa; latin america; north america; asia pacific; global ventures; and bottling investments. our operating structure also includes corporate, which consists of a center and a platform services organization. for additional information regarding our operating segments and corporate, refer to note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements. structural changes, acquired brands and newly licensed brands in order to continually improve upon the company's operating performance, from time to time, we engage in buying and selling ownership interests in bottling partners and other manufacturing operations. in addition, we periodically acquire brands and their related operations or enter into license agreements for certain brands to supplement our beverage offerings. these items impact our operating results and certain key metrics used by management in assessing the company's performance. unit case volume growth is a key metric used by management to evaluate the company's performance because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. the company's unit case volume represents the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers and, therefore, reflects unit case volume for both consolidated and unconsolidated bottlers. refer to the heading \"beverage volume\" below. concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished products sold by, the company to its bottling partners or other customers. for costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the company to customers or consumers. refer to the heading \"beverage volume\" below. when we analyze our net operating revenues, we generally consider the following factors: (1) volume growth (concentrate sales volume or unit case volume, as applicable); (2) changes in price, product and geographic mix; (3) foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and (4) acquisitions and divestitures (including structural changes as defined below), as applicable. refer to the heading \"net operating revenues\" below. the company sells concentrates and syrups to both consolidated and unconsolidated bottling partners. the ownership structure of our bottling partners impacts the timing of recognizing concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume. when we sell concentrates or syrups to our consolidated bottling partners, we do not recognize the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume until the bottling partner has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party. when we sell concentrates or syrups to our unconsolidated bottling partners, we recognize the concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when the concentrates or syrups are sold to the bottling partner. the subsequent sale of the finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party does not impact the timing of recognizing the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume. when we account for an unconsolidated bottling partner as an equity method investment, we eliminate the intercompany profit related to concentrate sales to the extent of our ownership interest, until the equity method investee has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party. we typically report unit case volume when finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups are sold to a third party, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. we generally refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling operations as \"structural changes,\" which are a component of acquisitions and divestitures. typically, structural changes do not impact the company's unit case volume or concentrate sales volume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. we recognize unit case volume for all sales of company beverage products, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. however, the unit case volume reported by our bottling investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of our consolidated bottling operations. refer to note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company's acquisitions and divestitures. \"acquired brands\" refers to brands acquired during the past 12 months. typically, the company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of a transaction. therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to an acquired brand are incremental to prior year volume. we generally do not consider the acquisition of a brand to be a structural change. \"licensed brands\" refers to brands not owned by the company but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and from which we derive an economic benefit when the related products are sold. typically, the company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand in periods prior to the beginning of the term of a license agreement. therefore, in the year that a license agreement is entered into, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand are incremental to prior year volume. we generally do not consider the licensing of a brand to be a structural change. in august 2022, the company acquired a controlling interest in a bottling operation in malawi. the impact of this acquisition has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the bottling investments and europe, middle east and africa operating segments. additionally, in november 2022, the company refranchised our bottling operations in cambodia. the impact of this refranchising has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the bottling investments and asia pacific operating segments. in november 2021, the company acquired the remaining ownership interest in ba sports nutrition, llc (\"bodyarmor\"). the impact of this acquisition has been included in acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the north america operating segment. beverage volume we measure the volume of company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. as used in this report, \"unit case\" means a unit of measurement equal to 192 u.s. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, which are primarily measured in number of transactions; and \"unit case volume\" means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers. unit case volume consists primarily of beverage products bearing company trademarks. also included in unit case volume are certain brands licensed to, or distributed by, our company, and brands owned by coca-cola system bottlers for which our company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive an economic benefit. in addition, unit case volume includes sales by certain joint ventures in which the company has an ownership interest. we believe unit case volume is one of the indicators of the underlying strength of the coca-cola system because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. the unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the company from its bottling partners and distributors. concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the company to its bottling partners or other customers. for costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the company to customers or consumers. unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. factors such as seasonality, bottlers' inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. in addition to these items, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the company has an ownership interest, but to which the company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals, may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. information about our volume growth worldwide and by operating segment is as follows: percent change 2022 versus 2021 unit cases 1,2 concentrate sales worldwide 5 % 5 % europe, middle east &amp; africa 3 % 2 % latin america 6 7 north america 2 1 asia pacific 6 8 global ventures 13 13 bottling investments 12 n/a bottling investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only. geographic and global ventures operating segment data reflect unit case volume growth for all bottlers, both consolidated and unconsolidated, and distributors in the applicable geographic areas. global ventures operating segment data also reflects unit case volume growth for costa retail stores. unit case volume the coca-cola system sold 32.7 billion and 31.3 billion unit cases of our products in 2022 and 2021, respectively. the increase was primarily a result of strength in away-from-home channels and ongoing investments in the marketplace. unit case volume in europe, middle east and africa increased 3 percent, which included 4 percent growth in trademark coca-cola, 6 percent growth in water, sports, coffee and tea, and 2 percent growth in sparkling flavors, partially offset by a 13 percent decline in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages. the operating segment reported growth in unit case volume of 8 percent in the eurasia and middle east operating unit and 1 percent in the europe operating unit. unit case volume in the africa operating unit was even. the growth in the europe operating unit included the impact of the suspension of the company's business in russia. the performance in the africa operating unit included the impact of transitioning certain territories to new franchise bottling partners. in latin america, unit case volume increased 6 percent, which included 5 percent growth in trademark coca-cola, 10 percent growth in water, sports, coffee and tea, 6 percent growth in sparkling flavors and 10 percent growth in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages. the operating segment's volume performance included 5 percent growth in mexico, 9 percent growth in brazil and 11 percent growth in argentina. unit case volume in north america increased 2 percent, which included 1 percent growth in trademark coca-cola, 3 percent growth in both sparkling flavors and juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages, and even performance in water, sports, coffee and tea. in asia pacific, unit case volume increased 6 percent, which included 8 percent growth in sparkling flavors, 6 percent growth in trademark coca-cola, 4 percent growth in water, sports, coffee and tea, and 9 percent growth in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages. the operating segment reported growth in unit case volume of 36 percent in the india and southwest asia operating unit, 6 percent in the asean and south pacific operating unit, and 2 percent in the japan and south korea operating unit, partially offset by a decline of 3 percent in the greater china and mongolia operating unit. unit case volume for global ventures increased 13 percent, driven by 12 percent growth in water, sports, coffee and tea along with growth in energy drinks, partially offset by a decline of 3 percent in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages. unit case volume for bottling investments increased 12 percent, which primarily reflects growth in india, south africa and vietnam. concentrate sales volume in 2022, worldwide concentrate sales volume and unit case volume both grew 5 percent compared to 2021. the differences between concentrate sales volume and unit case volume growth rates for the operating segments were primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments and the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the company has an ownership interest, but to which the company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals. net operating revenues net operating revenues were $43,004 million in 2022, compared to $38,655 million in 2021, an increase of $4,349 million, or 11 percent. the following table illustrates, on a percentage basis, the estimated impact of the factors resulting in the increase (decrease) in net operating revenues on a consolidated basis and for each of our operating segments: percent change 2022 versus 2021 volume price, product &amp; geographic mix foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations acquisitions &amp; divestitures total consolidated 5 % 11 % (7) % 2 % 11 % europe, middle east &amp; africa 2 % 16 % (14) % - % 5 % latin america 7 17 (5) - 19 north america 1 12 - 6 19 asia pacific 8 3 (9) - 3 global ventures 13 - (11) -

sales volume for our geographic operating segments and our global ventures operating segment (expressed in unit case equivalents) after considering the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, if any. for our bottling investments operating segment, this represents the percent change in net operating revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. our bottling investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. refer to the heading \"beverage volume\" above. includes structural changes, if any. refer to the heading \"structural changes, acquired brands and newly licensed brands\" above. refer to the heading \"beverage volume\" above for additional information related to changes in our unit case and concentrate sales volumes. \"price, product and geographic mix\" refers to the change in net operating revenues caused by factors such as price changes, the mix of products and packages sold, and the mix of channels and geographic territories where the sales occurred. the impact of price, product and geographic mix is calculated by subtracting the change in net operating revenues resulting from volume increases or decreases, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures from the total change in net operating revenues. management believes that providing investors with price, product and geographic mix enhances their understanding about the combined impact that the following items had on the company's net operating revenues: (1) pricing actions taken by the company and, where applicable, our bottling partners; (2) changes in the mix of products and packages sold; (3) changes in the mix of channels where products were sold; and (4) changes in the mix of geographic territories where products were sold. management uses this measure in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the company's performance. price, product and geographic mix had an 11 percent favorable impact on our consolidated net operating revenues. price, product and geographic mix was impacted by a variety of factors and events, including, but not limited to, the following: •europe, middle east and africa - favorable pricing initiatives, including inflationary pricing in türkiye, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix; •latin america - favorable pricing initiatives, including inflationary pricing in argentina, along with favorable channel and package mix; •north america - favorable pricing initiatives, including a benefit resulting from the timing of price increases in the prior year, and favorable channel, package and product mix; •asia pacific - favorable pricing initiatives along with favorable channel and package mix, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix; •global ventures - favorable pricing initiatives and favorable channel mix, primarily due to the timing of costa retail store reopenings in the united kingdom in the prior year, offset by the unfavorable impact of no longer receiving covid-related incentives in the current year; and •bottling investments - favorable pricing initiatives across most markets, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix. the favorable channel and package mix for the year ended december 31, 2022 in all applicable operating segments was primarily a result of strength in away-from-home channels in the current year and the impact of social distancing measures in the prior year. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our consolidated net operating revenues by 7 percent. this unfavorable impact was primarily due to a stronger u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, including the japanese yen, turkish lira, euro, british pound sterling, philippine peso, south african rand and argentine peso, which had an unfavorable impact on our asia pacific; europe, middle east and africa; global ventures; bottling investments; and latin america operating segments. the unfavorable impact of a stronger u.s. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a weaker u.s. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the brazilian real and mexican peso, which had a favorable impact on our latin america operating segment. refer to the heading \"liquidity, capital resources and financial position - foreign exchange\" below for additional information about the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. \"acquisitions and divestitures\" generally refers to acquisitions and divestitures of brands or businesses, some of which the company considers to be structural changes. the impact of acquisitions and divestitures is the difference between the change in net operating revenues and the change in what our net operating revenues would have been if we removed the net operating revenues associated with an acquisition or a divestiture from either the current year or the prior year, as applicable. management believes that quantifying the impact that acquisitions and divestitures had on the company's net operating revenues provides investors with useful information to enhance their understanding of the company's net operating revenue performance by improving their ability to compare our year-to-year results. management considers the impact of acquisitions and divestitures when evaluating the company's performance. refer to the heading \"structural changes, acquired brands and newly licensed brands\" above for additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures. net operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume; price, product and geographic mix; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and acquisitions and divestitures. the size and timing of acquisitions and divestitures are not consistent from period to period. based on current spot rates and our hedging coverage in place, we expect foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will have an unfavorable impact on our full year 2023 net operating revenues. information about our net operating revenues by operating segment and corporate as a percentage of company net operating revenues is as follows: year ended december 31, 2022 2021 europe, middle east &amp; africa 16.0 % 17.0 % latin america 11.4 10.7 north america 36.5 34.1 asia pacific 11.0 12.1 global ventures 6.6 7.3 bottling investments 18.3 18.6 corporate 0.2 0.2 total 100.0 % 100.0 % the percentage contribution of each operating segment fluctuates over time due to net operating revenues in some operating segments growing at a faster rate compared to other operating segments. in addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impact the percentage contribution of each operating segment. for additional information about the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, refer to the heading \"liquidity, capital resources and financial position - foreign exchange\" below. gross profit margin gross profit margin is a ratio calculated by dividing gross profit by net operating revenues. management believes gross profit margin provides investors with useful information related to the profitability of our business prior to considering all of the selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating charges incurred. management uses this measure in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the company's performance. our gross profit margin decreased to 58.1 percent in 2022 from 60.3 percent in 2021. this decrease was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, increased commodity and transportation costs, and the acquisition of bodyarmor, a finished goods business, in november 2021. the impact of these items was partially offset by favorable pricing initiatives as well as favorable channel and package mix. we expect commodity and transportation costs to continue to have an unfavorable impact on our gross profit margin in 2023, and we will continue to proactively take actions in an effort to mitigate the impact of these incremental costs. selling, general and administrative expenses the following table sets forth the components of selling, general and administrative expenses (in millions): year ended december 31, 2022 2021 selling and distribution expenses $2,767 $2,574 advertising expenses 4,319 4,098 stock-based compensation expense 356 337 other operating expenses 5,438 5,135 selling, general and administrative expenses $12,880 $12,144 selling, general and administrative expenses increased $736 million, or 6 percent, in 2022. this increase was primarily due to increased marketing spending, higher selling and distribution expenses, and higher annual incentive and stock-based compensation expense. the increase in selling and distribution expenses was due to the continued recovery from the covid-19 pandemic. the increase in stock-based compensation expense was primarily due to our strong financial performance in 2022 and a more favorable outlook of our future financial performance, which resulted in higher payout assumptions as compared to 2021. in 2022, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased selling, general and administrative expenses by 6 percent. as of december 31, 2022, we had $325 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based compensation awards granted under our plans, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years as stock-based compensation expense. this expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock-based compensation awards. refer to note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements. other operating charges other operating charges incurred by operating segment and

bottling investments - - corporate 1,146 643 total $1,215 $846 in 2022, the company recorded other operating charges of $1,215 million. these charges primarily consisted of $1,000 million related to the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability to fair value in conjunction with our acquisition of fairlife, llc (\"fairlife\") in 2020, $85 million related to the company's productivity and reinvestment program and $57 million related to the impairment of a trademark in asia pacific. in addition, other operating charges included $38 million related to the restructuring of our north america operating unit and $38 million related to the bodyarmor acquisition in 2021, which included various transition and transaction costs, employee retention costs and the amortization of noncompete agreements, net of the reimbursement of distributor termination fees recorded in 2021. these charges were partially offset by a net gain of $6 million due to revisions of management's estimates related to the company's strategic realignment initiatives. in 2021, the company recorded other operating charges of $846 million. these charges primarily consisted of $369 million related to the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability to fair value in conjunction with the fairlife acquisition, $146 million related to the company's strategic realignment initiatives, $119 million related to the bodyarmor acquisition, which includes various transition and transaction costs, distributor termination fees, employee retention costs and the amortization of noncompete agreements, and $115 million related to the company's productivity and reinvestment program. in addition, other operating charges included an impairment charge of $78 million related to a trademark in europe, which was driven by a change in the long-term outlook on the licensing arrangement for a certain brand, charges of $15 million related to tax litigation and a net charge of $4 million related to the restructuring of our manufacturing operations in the united states. refer to note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the bodyarmor and fairlife

meaningful. operating income was $10,909 million in 2022, compared to $10,308 million in 2021, an increase of $601 million, or 6 percent. the increase in operating income was primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 5 percent, favorable channel and package mix, and favorable pricing initiatives, partially offset by higher other operating charges; increased marketing spending; and an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact. the decrease in our operating margin on a consolidated basis was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, increased commodity and transportation costs, increased marketing spending, and the acquisition of bodyarmor, a finished goods business, in november 2021. the impact of these items was partially offset by favorable pricing initiatives as well as favorable channel and package mix. in 2022, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted consolidated operating income by 9 percent due to a stronger u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, including the japanese yen, turkish lira, euro, argentine peso, and british pound sterling, which had an unfavorable impact on our asia pacific; europe, middle east and africa; latin america; and global ventures operating segments. the unfavorable impact of a stronger u.s. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a weaker u.s. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the mexican peso and brazilian real, which had a favorable impact on our latin america operating segment. refer to the heading \"liquidity, capital resources and financial position - foreign exchange\" below. the company's europe, middle east and africa operating segment reported operating income of $3,958 million and $3,735 million for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the increase in operating income was primarily driven by a 2 percent increase in concentrate sales volume, favorable pricing initiatives, favorable channel and package mix, and lower other operating charges, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 17 percent, higher commodity costs, increased operating expenses and increased marketing spending. latin america reported operating income of $2,870 million and $2,534 million for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the increase in operating income was primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 7 percent, favorable pricing initiatives, favorable channel and package mix, and lower other operating charges, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 6 percent, higher commodity costs and increased marketing spending. operating income for north america for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 was $3,742 million and $3,331 million, respectively. the increase in operating income was primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 1 percent, favorable pricing initiatives, favorable channel and category mix and lower other operating charges, partially offset by increased marketing spending and increased operating expenses. asia pacific's operating income for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 was $2,303 million and $2,325 million, respectively. the decrease in operating income was primarily driven by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 8 percent, increased marketing spending, increased operating expenses and higher other operating charges, partially offset by concentrate sales volume growth of 8 percent, favorable pricing initiatives, and favorable channel and package mix. global ventures' operating income for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 was $185 million and $293 million, respectively. the decrease in operating income was primarily driven by the impact of no longer receiving covid-related incentives in the current year, higher commodity costs, higher selling and distribution expenses, and an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 2 percent, partially offset by concentrate sales volume growth of 13 percent. bottling investments' operating income for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 was $487 million and $473 million, respectively. the increase in operating income was primarily driven by unit case volume growth of 12 percent and favorable pricing initiatives, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 9 percent and higher selling and distribution expenses. corporate's operating loss for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 was $2,636 million and $2,383 million, respectively. operating loss in 2022 increased primarily as a result of higher other operating charges due to the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability to fair value in conjunction with the fairlife acquisition and increased marketing spending. interest income interest income was $449 million in 2022, compared to $276 million in 2021, an increase of $173 million, or 62 percent. this increase was primarily driven by higher returns in certain of our international locations. interest expense interest expense was $882 million in 2022, compared to $1,597 million in 2021, a decrease of $715 million, or 45 percent. this decrease was primarily due to charges in 2021 of $650 million associated with the extinguishment of long-term debt and certain hedging activities that occurred during 2021, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates in 2022. refer to note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements. equity income (loss) - net equity income (loss) - net represents our company's proportionate share of net income or loss from each of our equity method investees. in 2022, equity income was $1,472 million, compared to equity income of $1,438 million in 2021, an increase of $34 million, or 2 percent. the increase was primarily due to more favorable operating results reported by several of our equity method investees in the current year, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact and the sale of all or a portion of our ownership interest in certain equity method investees. in addition, the company recorded net charges of $34 million and $13 million during the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which represent the company's proportionate share of significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by certain of our equity method investees. other income (loss) - net other income (loss) - net includes, among other things, dividend income; gains and losses related to the disposal of property, plant and equipment; gains and losses related to acquisitions and divestitures; non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost or income for pension and other postretirement benefit plans; other charges and credits related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans; realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and trading debt securities; realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities; other-than-temporary impairment charges; and net foreign currency exchange gains and losses. foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. the effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheet. refer to note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements. in 2022, other income (loss) - net was a loss of $262 million. the company recorded a net loss of $371 million related to realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and trading debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, net foreign currency exchange losses of $236 million, an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $96 million related to an equity method investee in russia, and a net loss of $24 million as a result of one of our equity method investees issuing additional shares of its stock. additionally, other income (loss) - net included net income of $219 million related to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit income, a net gain of $153 million related to the refranchising of our bottling operations in cambodia and dividend income of $111 million. in 2021, other income (loss) - net was income of $2,000 million. the company recognized a gain of $834 million in conjunction with the bodyarmor acquisition; a net gain of $695 million related to the sale of our ownership interest in coca-cola amatil limited (\"cca\"), an equity method investee, to ccep, also an equity method investee; and a net gain of $114 million related to the sale of our ownership interest in an equity method investee and the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in another equity method investee. additionally, the company recognized a net gain of $467 million related to realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and trading debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities. other income (loss) - net also included $277 million related to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit income, dividend income of $73 million, charges of $266 million related to the restructuring of our manufacturing operations in the united states, pension plan settlement charges of $117 million related to our strategic realignment initiatives and net foreign currency exchange losses of $61 million. refer to note 2 of notes

refer to note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on equity and debt securities. refer to note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the restructuring of our manufacturing operations in the united states and the impairment charges. refer to note 18 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company's strategic realignment initiatives. refer to note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements for the impact these items had on our operating segments and corporate. income taxes our effective tax rate reflects the tax benefits of having significant operations outside the united states, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the statutory u.s. federal tax rate. as a result of employment actions and capital investments made by the company, certain tax jurisdictions provide income tax incentive grants, including brazil, costa rica, singapore and eswatini. the terms of these grants expire from 2025 to 2036. we anticipate that we will be able to extend or renew the grants in these locations. tax incentive grants favorably impacted our income tax expense by $406 million and $381 million for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. in addition, our effective tax rate reflects the benefits of having significant earnings generated in investments accounted for under the equity method. a reconciliation of the statutory u.s. federal tax rate and our effective tax rate is as follows: year ended december 31, 2022 2021 statutory u.s. federal tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % state and local income taxes - net of federal benefit 1.4 1.1 earnings in jurisdictions taxed at rates different from the statutory u.s. federal tax rate (0.6) 2.3 equity income or loss (2.7) (2.0) excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation (0.7) (0.5) other - net (0.3) (0.8) effective tax rate 18.1 % 21.1 % 1 includes net tax charges of $375 million (or a 3.0 percent impact on our effective tax rate) related to changes in tax laws in certain foreign jurisdictions, amounts required to be recorded for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, in various international jurisdictions, as well as other discrete items. 2 includes a tax benefit of $14 million (or a 1.5 percent impact on our effective tax rate) associated with the $834 million gain recorded upon the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in bodyarmor. refer to note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements. on november 18, 2020, the tax court issued the opinion regarding the company's 2015 litigation with the irs involving transfer pricing tax adjustments in which the court predominantly sided with the irs. the company disagrees with the opinion and intends to vigorously defend its position. refer to note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements. as of december 31, 2022, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $926 million. if the company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be a benefit of $617 million, exclusive of any benefits related to interest and penalties. the remaining $309 million primarily represents tax benefits that would be received in different tax jurisdictions in the event the company did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions. a reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions): year ended december 31, 2022 2021 balance of unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year $906 $915 increase related to prior period tax positions 6 9 decrease related to prior period tax positions - (50) increase related to current period tax positions 38 37 decrease related to settlements with taxing authorities (2) (4) effect of foreign currency translation (22) (1) balance of unrecognized tax benefits at end of year $926 $906 the company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the line item income taxes in our consolidated statement of income. the company had $496 million and $453 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. of these amounts, expense of $43 million and $62 million was recognized in 2022 and 2021, respectively. if the company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the reversal of this accrual would be a benefit to the company's effective tax rate. based on current tax laws, the company's effective tax rate in 2023 is expected to be approximately 19.5 percent before considering the potential impact of any significant operating and nonoperating items that may affect our effective tax rate. liquidity, capital resources and financial position we believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of the fundamental strengths of our business. refer to the heading \"cash flows from operating activities\" below. the company does not typically raise capital through the issuance of stock. instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on shareowners' equity. refer to the heading \"cash flows from financing activities\" below. we have a history of borrowing funds both domestically and internationally at reasonable interest rates, and we expect to be able to continue to borrow funds at reasonable rates over the long term. our debt financing also includes the use of a commercial paper program. we currently have the ability to borrow funds in this market at levels that are consistent with our debt financing strategy, and we expect to continue to be able to do so in the future. the company regularly reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt. the company's cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities totaled $11.6 billion as of december 31, 2022. in addition to these funds, our commercial paper program and our ability to issue long-term debt, we had $4.4 billion in unused backup lines of credit for general corporate purposes as of december 31, 2022. these backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2023 through 2028. our current capital allocation priorities are as follows: investing wisely to support our business operations, continuing to grow our dividend payment, enhancing our beverage portfolio and capabilities through consumer-centric acquisitions, and using excess cash to repurchase shares over time. we currently expect 2023 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.9 billion. during 2023, we also expect to repurchase shares to offset dilution resulting from employee stock-based compensation plans. we are currently in litigation with the irs for tax years 2007 through 2009. on november 18, 2020, the tax court issued the opinion in which it predominantly sided with the irs; however, a final decision is still pending and the timing of such decision is not currently known. the company strongly disagrees with the irs' positions and the portions of the opinion affirming such positions and intends to vigorously defend our positions utilizing every available avenue of appeal. while the company believes that it is more likely than not that we will ultimately prevail in this litigation upon appeal, it is possible that all, or some portion of, the adjustments proposed by the irs and sustained by the tax court could ultimately be upheld. in the event that all of the adjustments proposed by the irs were ultimately upheld for tax years 2007 through 2009 and the irs, with the consent of the federal courts, were to decide to apply the tax court methodology to the subsequent years up to and including 2022, the company currently estimates that the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability could be approximately $14 billion as of december 31, 2022. additional income tax and interest would continue to accrue until the time any such potential liability, or portion thereof, were to be paid. once the tax court renders a final decision, the company will have 90 days to file a notice of appeal and pay the portion of the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years, which we currently estimate to be approximately $5.2 billion (including interest accrued through december 31, 2022), plus any additional interest accrued through the time of payment. refer to note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the tax litigation. while we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail in the tax litigation discussed above, we are confident that, between our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities and our ability to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates, we can manage the range of possible outcomes in the final resolution of the matter. based on all of the aforementioned factors, the company believes its current liquidity position is strong and will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for the foreseeable future. cash flows from operating activities as part of our continued efforts to improve our working capital efficiency, we have worked with our suppliers over the past several years to revisit terms and conditions, including the extension of payment terms. our current payment terms with the majority of our suppliers are 120 days. additionally, two global financial institutions offer a voluntary supply chain finance (\"scf\") program which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the company to these financial institutions on a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus may be more beneficial to them. the scf program is available to suppliers of goods and services included in cost of goods sold as well as suppliers of goods and services included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. the company and our suppliers agree on contractual terms for the goods and services we procure, including prices, quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the scf program. the suppliers sell goods or services, as applicable, to the company and issue the associated invoices to the company based on the agreed-upon contractual terms. then, if they are participating in the scf program, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine which invoices, if any, they want to sell to the financial institutions. our suppliers' voluntary inclusion of invoices in the scf program has no bearing on our payment terms. no guarantees are provided by the company or any of our subsidiaries under the scf program. we have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to participate in the scf program, and we have no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions, as it relates to the scf program. accordingly, amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the scf program are included in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet. all activity related to amounts due to suppliers that elected to participate in the scf program is reflected within the operating activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. we have been informed by the financial institutions that as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, suppliers had elected to sell $1,234 million and $882 million, respectively, of our outstanding payment obligations to the financial institutions. the amounts settled through the scf program were $4,724 million and $3,237 million during the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. we do not believe there is a risk that our payment terms will be shortened in the near future. the company has a trade accounts receivable factoring program in certain countries. under this program, we can elect to sell trade accounts receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions at a discount. in these factoring arrangements, for ease of administration, the company collects customer payments related to the factored receivables and remits those payments to the financial institutions. the company sold $10,709 million and $6,266 million of trade accounts receivables under this program during the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the costs of factoring such receivables were $27 million and $5 million for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the cash received from the financial institutions is classified within the operating activities section in our consolidated statement of cash flows. net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 was $11,018 million and $12,625 million, respectively, a decrease of $1,607 million, or 13 percent. this decrease was primarily driven by higher marketing payments resulting from 2021 year-end accruals, an unfavorable impact due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the buildup of inventory to manage potential supply chain disruptions, and higher annual incentive and tax payments in 2022. these items were partially offset by increased operating income, lower payments related to our strategic realignment initiatives, and increased benefits from the extension of certain vendor payment terms and our trade accounts receivable factoring program. cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $763 million and $2,765 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. purchases of investments and proceeds from disposals of investments in 2022, purchases of investments were $3,751 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $4,771 million, resulting in a net cash inflow of $1,020 million. in 2021, purchases of investments were $6,030 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $7,059 million, resulting in a net cash inflow of $1,029 million. this activity primarily represents the purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments in marketable securities and short-term investments that were made as part of the company's overall cash management strategy. also included in this activity are purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments held by our captive insurance companies. acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities in 2022, the company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $73 million. in 2021, the company's acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $4,766 million, which primarily related to the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in bodyarmor. refer to note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our acquisitions. proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities in 2022, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $458 million, which primarily related to the refranchising of our bottling operations in cambodia and the sale of our ownership interest in one of our equity method investments. in 2021, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $2,180 million, which primarily related to the sale of our ownership interest in cca, an equity method investee, to ccep, also an equity method investee. refer to note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our disposals. purchases of property, plant and equipment purchases of property, plant and equipment during the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 were $1,484 million and $1,367 million, respectively. total capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and the percentage of such totals by operating segment and corporate were as follows (in millions): year ended december 31, 2022 2021 capital expenditures $1,484 $1,367 europe, middle east &amp; africa 3.3 % 2.6 % latin america 0.3 0.1 north america 18.9 16.7 asia pacific 1.5 4.8 global

the year ended december 31, 2022 was $1,465 million. refer to note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our hedging activities. other investing activities during the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, the total cash inflow for other investing activities was $706 million and $51 million, respectively. the activities during 2022 included cash proceeds of $823 million received in advance of the refranchising of our bottling operations in vietnam. refer to note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on this transaction. cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities was $10,250 million and $6,786 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. debt financing our company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners' equity. this exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings. as of december 31, 2022, our long-term debt was rated \"a+\" by standard & poor's and \"a1\" by moody's. our commercial paper program was rated \"a-1\" by standard & poor's and \"p-1\" by moody's. in assessing our credit strength, both rating agencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and financial policies as well as the consolidated balance sheet and other financial information of the company. in addition, certain rating agencies also consider the financial information of certain bottlers, including ccep, coca-cola consolidated, inc., coca-cola femsa and coca-cola hellenic. while the company has no legal obligation for the debt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the company's business model provides the company with an incentive to keep these bottlers viable. it is our expectation that these rating agencies will continue using this methodology. if our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure, our major bottlers' financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies' methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. additionally, if certain bottlers' credit ratings were to decline, the company's equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential increase in interest expense for those bottlers. we monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. each rating agency employs a different aggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. these thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our company. our global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to borrow funds at a low effective cost. this posture, coupled with active management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt as well as our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of borrowing. our debt management policies, in conjunction with our share repurchase program and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets. issuances and payments of debt included both short-term and long-term financing activities. during 2022, the company had issuances of debt of $3,972 million, which included $2,321 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days, $798 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less, and long-term debt issuances of $853 million, net of related discounts and issuance costs. during 2022, the company made payments of debt of $4,930 million, which consisted of $3,623 million of payments related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days and payments of long-term debt of $1,307 million. during 2021, the company had issuances of debt of $13,094 million, which included $3,391 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days, $80 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less, and long-term debt issuances of $9,623 million, net of related discounts and issuance costs. during 2021, the company made payments of debt of $12,866 million, which consisted of $2,357 million of payments related to commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days and payments of long-term debt of $10,509 million. on december 31, 2021, the united kingdom's financial conduct authority, the governing body responsible for regulating libor, ceased to publish certain libor reference rates. however, other libor reference rates, including u.s. dollar overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month maturities, will continue to be published through june 2023. in preparation for the discontinuation of libor, we have amended, or will amend, our libor-referencing agreements to either reference the secured overnight financing rate or include mechanics for selecting an alternative rate. we do not plan to enter into variable-rate agreements that reference libor in the future. issuances of stock the issuances of stock in 2022 and 2021 were related to the exercise of stock options by employees. share repurchases in 2012, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase plan of up to 500 million shares (\"2012 plan\") of the company's common stock. in may 2022, the company reached the maximum number of shares that could be repurchased under the 2012 plan and thereby completed the plan. in 2019, our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase plan of up to 150 million shares of the company's common stock. during 2022, the total cash outflow for treasury stock purchases was $1,418 million. the company repurchased 21.3 million shares of common stock under the share repurchase plans authorized by our board of directors. these shares were repurchased at an average price per share of $62.67, for a total cost of $1,336 million. since the inception of our share repurchase program in 1984, we have repurchased 3.5 billion shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $17.53. in addition to shares repurchased under the share repurchase plans authorized by our board of directors, the company's treasury stock activity also includes shares surrendered to the company to pay the exercise price and/or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with so-called stock swap exercises of employee stock options and/or the vesting of restricted stock issued to employees. the net impact of the company's issuances of stock and share repurchases during 2022 resulted in a net cash outflow of $581 million. during 2021, the company did not repurchase shares of our common stock under the share repurchase plans authorized by our board of directors. dividends the company paid dividends of $7,616 million and $7,252 million during the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. at its february 2023 meeting, our board of directors increased our regular quarterly dividend to $0.46 per share, equivalent to a full year dividend of $1.84 per share in 2023. this is our 61st consecutive annual increase. our annualized common stock dividend was $1.76 per share and $1.68 per share in 2022 and 2021, respectively. other financing activities during the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, the total cash outflow for other financing activities was $1,095 million and $353 million, respectively. the activities during 2022 included payments totaling $637 million related to the bodyarmor acquisition, which included amounts originally held back for indemnification obligations. additionally, other financing activities during 2022 and 2021 included repayments of collateral related to our hedging programs. contractual obligations as of december 31, 2022, the company's contractual obligations, including payments due by period, were as follows (in millions): payments due

additional information regarding loans and notes payable. upon payment of outstanding commercial paper, we typically issue new commercial paper. lines of credit and other short-term borrowings are expected to fluctuate depending upon current liquidity needs, especially at international subsidiaries. refer to note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding long-term debt. we will consider several alternatives for settling this long-term debt, including the use of cash flows from operating activities, issuance of commercial paper or issuance of other long-term debt. the table above shows expected cash payments to be made by the company and excludes the noncash portion of debt, including any fair market value adjustments, unamortized discounts and premiums. we calculated estimated interest payments for our long-term debt based on the applicable rates and payment dates. for our variable-rate debt, we have assumed the december 31, 2022 rate for all periods presented. we expect to fund such interest payments with cash flows from operating activities and/or short-term borrowings. refer to note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes. accrued income taxes include $2,886 million related to the one-time transition tax required by the tax reform act. liabilities of $1,424 million for unrecognized tax benefits plus accrued interest and penalties are not included in the total above. currently, the settlement period for the unrecognized tax benefits cannot be determined. in addition, any payments related to unrecognized tax benefits may be partially or fully offset by reductions in payments in other jurisdictions. purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. these agreements include long-term contractual obligations, open purchase orders, accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities. we expect to fund these purchase obligations with cash flows from operating activities. we expect to fund these marketing obligations with cash flows from operating activities. represents obligations related to our acquisitions of fairlife and bodyarmor. refer to note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information. represents $823 million received in december 2022 in advance of the refranchising of the company's bottling operations in vietnam in january 2023 as well as liabilities and contractual obligations that were classified as held for sale. refer to note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information. the total accrued liability for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of december 31, 2022 was $942 million. refer to note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements. this amount is impacted by, among other items, net periodic benefit cost or income, plan funding levels, plan amendments, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and the investment return on plan assets. because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs, we did not include this amount in the table above. we expect to make all contributions to our pension trusts with cash flows from operating activities. our pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and tax regulations. the company expects to contribute approximately $42 million in 2023 to our pension trusts, all of which will be allocated to our international plans. refer to note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements. we did not include our estimated contributions to our pension trusts in the table above. 56 as of december 31, 2022, the projected benefit obligation of the u.s. qualified pension plan was $4,101 million, and the fair value of the plan assets was $4,336 million. the projected benefit obligation of all pension plans other than the u.s. qualified pension plan was $2,275 million, and the fair value of the plans' assets was $2,822 million. the company sponsors various unfunded pension plans outside the united states as well as unfunded nonqualified pension plans covering certain u.s. employees. these u.s. nonqualified pension plans provide benefits that are not permitted to be funded through a qualified plan because of limits imposed by the internal revenue code of 1986. the expected benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans are not included in the table above. however, we anticipate benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans will be approximately $65 million annually for 2023 through 2025. thereafter, the expected annual benefit payments will gradually decline. refer to note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements. in general, we are self-insured for large portions of many different types of claims; however, we do use commercial insurance above our self-insured retentions to reduce the company's risk of catastrophic loss. our reserves for the company's self-insured losses are estimated using actuarial methods and assumptions of the insurance industry, adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claims history. as of december 31, 2022, our self-insurance reserves totaled $199 million. refer to note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements. we did not include estimated payments related to our self-insurance reserves in the table above. deferred income tax liabilities as of december 31, 2022 were $2,914 million. refer to note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements. this amount is not included in the table above because we believe that presentation would not be meaningful. deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the underlying assets or liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. the results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future years. as a result, scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading, because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs. as of december 31, 2022, we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties of $1,017 million, of which $133 million was related to vies. our guarantees are primarily related to third-party customers, bottlers and vendors and arose through the normal course of business. these guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees is individually significant. these amounts represent the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under the guarantees. however, management has concluded that the likelihood of any significant amounts being paid by our company under these guarantees is not probable. as of december 31, 2022, we were not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity. foreign exchange our international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks, including currency fluctuations and governmental actions. we closely monitor our operations in each country and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to changing economic and political environments as well as to fluctuations in currencies. due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time. in 2022 and 2021, the weighted-average exchange rates for foreign currencies in which the company conducted operations (all operating currencies), and for certain individual currencies, strengthened (weakened) against the u.s. dollar as follows: year ended december 31, 2022 2021 all operating currencies (8) % 2 % australian dollar (7) % 10 % brazilian real 4 (4) british pound sterling (11) 3 euro (11) 5 japanese yen (17) (2) mexican peso 1 6 south african rand (9) 6 the percentages in the table above do not include the effects of our hedging activities and, therefore, do not reflect the actual impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our operating results. our hedging activities are designed to mitigate, over time, a portion of the potentially unfavorable impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net income. the total impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net operating revenues, including the effect of our hedging activities, was a decrease of 7 percent in 2022 and an increase of 1 percent in 2021. the total impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on income before income taxes, including the effect of our hedging activities, was a decrease of 6 percent in 2022 and an increase of 2 percent in 2021. foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. the effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheet. refer to note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements. foreign currency exchange gains and losses are recorded in the line item other income (loss) - net in our consolidated statement of income. refer to the heading \"operations review - other income (loss) - net\" above. the company recorded net foreign currency exchange losses of $236 million and $61 million during the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. impact of inflation and changing prices inflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world. in general, we believe that, over time, we will be able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability.\"\"\"\n\n    Instruction:\n    Identify and summarize all sentences or phrases that are directly or indirectly related to \"organizational

diluted 6.90 6.12 revenue increased in 2022 driven by increased volume, largely offset by lower realized prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. research and development expenses increased in 2022, driven primarily by higher development expenses for late-stage assets, partially offset by lower development expenses for covid-19 antibodies and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. marketing, selling, and administrative expenses in 2022 remained relatively flat compared to 2021 as increased costs associated with launches of new products and indications were offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. the following highlighted items affect comparisons of our 2022 and 2021 financial results: 2022 acquired ipr&d and development milestones (note 3 to the consolidated financial statements) •we recognized $908.5 million of acquired ipr&d and development milestones that included the buy-out of substantially all future obligations that were contingent upon the occurrence of certain events linked to the success of our mutant-selective pi3kα inhibitor and a purchase of a priority review voucher. asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges (note 5 to the consolidated financial statements) •we recognized charges of $244.6 million primarily related to an intangible asset impairment for gba1 gene therapy (pr001) due to changes in estimated launch timing. other-net, (income) expense (note 18 to the consolidated financial statements) •we recognized $410.7 million of net investment losses on equity securities. 2021 cost of sales (see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements) •we recognized a net inventory impairment charge related to our covid-19 antibodies of $339.7 million. as part of our response to the covid-19 pandemic, and at the request of the united states (u.s.) and international governments, we invested in large-scale manufacturing of covid-19 antibodies at risk, in order to ensure rapid access to patients around the world. as the covid-19 pandemic evolved during 2021, we incurred a net inventory impairment charge primarily due to the combination of changes to demand from u.s. and international governments, including changes to our agreement with the u.s. government, and near-term expiry dates of covid-19 antibodies. acquired ipr&d and development milestones (note 3 to the consolidated financial statements) •we recognized $970.1 million of acquired ipr&d and development milestones that included charges resulting from business development transactions with foghorn therapeutics inc. (foghorn), rigel pharmaceuticals, inc. (rigel), and precision biosciences, inc.

uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products, as well as a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development. to bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of $2 billion. failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after substantial investment. as a result, most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage, the application of pricing controls, limited scope of approved uses, label changes, changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. regulatory agencies establish high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products and indications. delays, uncertainties, unpredictabilities, and inconsistencies in drug approval processes across markets and agencies can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. in addition, it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of or variability in demand for new products and indications. we manage research and development spending across our portfolio of potential new medicines. a delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending. due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the research and development process, we cannot reliably estimate the nature, timing, and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our research and development projects, nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from any successful research and development project. each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline, and none is individually material to our consolidated research and development expense. while we do accumulate certain research and development costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes, we must make significant cost estimations and allocations, some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms. therefore, we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development costs by project, by preclinical versus clinical spend, or by therapeutic category. other matters patent matters we depend on patents or other forms of intellectual property protection for most of our revenue, cash flows, and earnings. following the expiration of patent exclusivity for alimta® in europe and japan in june 2021, we have faced generic competition that has rapidly and severely eroded revenue from prior levels, and we expect such competition will continue to erode revenues from current levels in these markets. in addition, as a result of the entry of multiple generics in the u.s. following the expiration of patent and pediatric exclusivity in the first half of 2022, we began facing, and expect to continue to face, generic competition that has rapidly and severely eroded revenue from prior levels, and we expect will continue to erode revenue from current levels. this decline in revenue will continue to impact period-over-period financial results comparisons, particularly during the first half of 2023. see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of legal proceedings currently pending regarding certain of our patents. our compound patents for humalog® (insulin lispro) have expired in the u.s. and major international markets, and we have also introduced lower-priced versions of humalog as part of our insulin access and affordability solutions. a competitor has a similar version of insulin lispro in the u.s. and in certain european markets. due to the impact of competition and pricing pressure in the u.s. and certain international markets, we expect that lower revenue for humalog due to realized price decline will continue over time. trends affecting pharmaceutical pricing, reimbursement, and access reforms, including those that may stem from periods of economic downturn or uncertainty, or as a result of high inflation, emergence or escalation of, and responses to, war or unrest (including the russia-ukraine war), or government budgeting priorities (including as exacerbated by the covid-19 pandemic), may continue to result in added pressure on pricing and reimbursement for our products. global concern over access to and affordability of pharmaceutical products continues to drive regulatory and legislative debate and action, as well as worldwide cost containment efforts by governmental authorities. such measures include the use of mandated discounts, price reporting requirements, mandated reference prices, restrictive formularies, changes to available intellectual property protections, as well as other efforts. in august 2022, the u.s. government enacted the inflation reduction act of 2022 (ira). among other measures, the ira will require the u.s. department of health and human services to effectively set prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed under medicare part b and part d. generally, these government prices apply nine (medicines approved under a new drug application) or thirteen (medicines approved under a biologics license application) years following initial fda approval and will be capped at a statutory ceiling price that is likely to represent a significant discount from average prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. it is too soon to tell how the u.s. government will set these prices as the law specifies a ceiling price, but not a minimum or floor price. one or more of our significant products may be selected, which would have the effect of accelerating revenue erosion prior to patent expiry. the effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products would significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations. the establishment of payment limits or other restrictions by drug affordability review boards and other state level actors would similarly impact us. other ira provisions provide for rebate obligations on drug manufacturers that increase prices of medicare part b and part d medicines at a rate greater than the rate of inflation and part d benefit redesign that includes replacing the part d coverage gap discount program with a new manufacturer discounting program. manufacturers that fail to comply with the ira may be subject to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties, which could be significant. the ira takes effect progressively starting in 2023, with the first government-set prices effective in 2026. the ira may meaningfully influence our business strategies and those of our competitors. in particular, the nine-year timeline to set prices for medicines approved under a new drug application may reduce the attractiveness of investment in small molecule innovation. the implications to us of a competitor's product being selected for price setting are also uncertain. provisions of the ira may be subject to legal challenges or other reformation, and the full impact of the ira on our business and the pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain. additional policies, regulations, legislation, or enforcement, including those proposed and/or pursued by the u.s. congress, the current u.s. presidential administration, and regulatory authorities worldwide, could adversely impact our business and consolidated results of operations. consolidation and integration of private payors and pharmacy benefit managers in the u.s. has also significantly impacted the market for pharmaceuticals by increasing payor leverage in negotiating manufacturer price or rebate concessions and pharmacy reimbursement rates. furthermore, restrictive or unfavorable pricing, coverage, or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by governments, regulatory agencies, courts, or private payers, such as the centers for medicare & medicaid services' national coverage determination for monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of alzheimer's disease, may adversely impact our business and consolidated results of operations. we expect that these actions may intensify and could particularly affect certain products, such as insulin, as governments manage and emerge from the covid-19 pandemic, which could adversely affect our business. in addition, we are engaged in litigation and investigations related to our 340b program and access to insulin that, if resolved adversely to us, could negatively impact our business and consolidated results of operations. it is not currently possible to predict the overall potential adverse impact to us or the general pharmaceutical industry of continued cost containment efforts worldwide. in addition, regulatory issues concerning compliance with current good manufacturing practices, quality assurance, evolving standards, and increased scrutiny around excipients and potential impurities such as nitrosamines, and similar regulations and standards (and comparable foreign regulations and standards) for our products can lead to regulatory and legal actions, product recalls and seizures, fines and penalties, interruption of production leading to product shortages, import bans or denials of import certifications, delays or denials in new product approvals or line extensions or supplemental approvals of current products pending resolution of the issues, and reputational harm, any of which would adversely affect our business. moreover, increased focus on business combinations across industries and jurisdictions can lead to impediments to the completion of business combinations. see item 1, \"business-regulations and private payer actions affecting pharmaceutical pricing, reimbursement, and access\" and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. product supply we have faced challenges, and expect to continue to face challenges, meeting strong demand for our incretin products, including due to the limited and fluctuating availability of competitor therapies. in the u.s., given very strong uptake of mounjaro following its launch in the u.s. for type 2 diabetes in the second quarter of 2022, and as demand for trulicity® has remained strong, we have experienced intermittent delays in fulfilling certain u.s. orders for these products. outside the u.s., we have implemented certain actions to minimize the impact on existing trulicity patients, but we expect to continue to experience intermittent disruptions in our supply of trulicity in international markets. we anticipate tight supplies of our incretin products will persist until additional manufacturing capacity is operationalized. we expect additional internal and contracted manufacturing capacity will become fully operational around the world in the next several years, with significant expansion in 2023, as part of our ongoing efforts to meet the significant demand for our incretin medicines. tax matters we are subject to income taxes and various other taxes in the u.s. and in many foreign jurisdictions; therefore, changes in both domestic and international tax laws or regulations have affected and may affect our effective tax rate, results of operations, and cash flows. in 2017, the u.s. enacted the tax cuts and jobs act (the 2017 tax act), which contained a provision that requires capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses for tax purposes starting in 2022. previously, these expenses could be deducted in the year incurred. the implementation of this provision increased our cash payments of income taxes by approximately $1.20 billion in 2022. while the implementation of this provision will continue to increase our cash payments of income taxes, the increase will moderately decrease from 2022 levels over the five-year amortization period. the u.s. and countries around the world are actively proposing and enacting tax law changes. further, actions taken with respect to tax-related matters by associations such as the organisation for economic co-operation and development and the european commission could influence tax laws in countries in which we operate. tax authorities in the u.s. and other jurisdictions in which we do business routinely examine our tax returns and are intensifying their scrutiny and examinations of profit allocations among jurisdictions. changes to existing u.s. and foreign tax laws and increased scrutiny by tax authorities in the u.s. and other jurisdictions could adversely impact our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows. foreign currency exchange rates and other impacts as a global company, we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the u.s. dollar against the euro, japanese yen, and chinese yuan. while we seek to manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques, significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a material impact, either positive or negative, on our consolidated results of operations in any given period. during the year ended december 31, 2022, revenue was unfavorably impacted by 3 percent due to foreign exchange rates. while there is uncertainty in the future movements in foreign exchange rates, fluctuations in these rates have, and we currently expect in the near-term future will, adversely impact our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. in addition, cost inflation, the strain on global transportation, logistics, and labor markets (including as exacerbated by the covid-19 pandemic and the emergence or escalation of, and responses to, war or unrest, including the russia-ukraine war), global economic downturns or uncertainty, and an increase in overall demand in our industry for certain products and materials have had, and may continue to have, a number of impacts on our business, including increased costs and disruptions in the supply of our medicines. acquisitions we invest in external research and technologies that we believe complement and strengthen our own efforts. these investments can take many forms, including acquisitions, collaborations, investments, and licensing arrangements. we view our business development activity as a way to enhance our pipeline and strengthen our business. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our recent acquisitions. covid-19 pandemic as the covid-19 pandemic evolves, we remain focused on protecting the health, safety, and well-being of our employees; supporting the medical system and our communities; and affordability of and access to our medicines. at the outset of the covid-19 pandemic, we also focused on researching, developing, and supplying covid-19 therapies, although we do not currently expect significant further revenue attributable to treatments for covid-19. the covid-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business and operations across markets to varying and fluctuating degrees, including as a result of cost inflation and strain on the global transportation, manufacturing, and labor markets, fewer in-person interactions among patients and healthcare providers and our employees with healthcare professionals in certain markets, pricing pressures, rebates, clawbacks, and other changes in reimbursement policies resulting from the financial strain of the covid-19 pandemic on government-funded healthcare systems, and risks related to our covid-19 therapies. the degree to which the covid-19 pandemic could continue to affect us will depend on developments that are highly uncertain and beyond our knowledge or control. for additional information, see item 1a, \"risk factors-risk related to our business-public health outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics, such as the covid-19 pandemic, have adversely impacted and may in the future adversely impact our business and operations.\" see item 1a, \"risk factors\" for additional information on risk factors that could impact our business and operations. results of operations operating results-2022 revenue the following table summarizes our revenue activity by region: year ended december 31,

numbers may not add due to rounding. in the u.s. the increase in volume in 2022 was primarily driven by trulicity, verzenio, jardiance, mounjaro, and taltz®, partially offset by decreased volume for alimta, following the entry of multiple generics in the first half of 2022. in the u.s. the decrease in realized prices was primarily driven by humalog, due to a list price reduction of insulin lispro injection and unfavorable segment mix, and trulicity and basaglar®, due to unfavorable segment mix and higher contracted rebates. in addition, the decrease in realized prices of humalog was partially offset by changes to estimates for rebates and discounts in 2021. outside the u.s. the increase in volume in 2022 was primarily driven by verzenio, trulicity, jardiance, tyvyt®, and taltz, partially offset by a decrease in volume due to generic competition for alimta and cymbalta® and decreased utilization of covid-19 antibodies. the decrease in realized prices outside the u.s. was primarily driven by the impact of government pricing in china from national reimbursement drug list (nrdl) formulary for certain products, particularly tyvyt and verzenio, and volume-based procurement (vbp) for humalog. 45 the following table summarizes our revenue activity in 2022 compared with 2021: year ended december 31, 2022 2021 percent change product u.s. outside u.s. total total trulicity $5,688.8

(4) olumiant revenue includes sales for baricitinib that were made pursuant to eua or similar regulatory authorizations. revenue of trulicity increased 16 percent in the u.s., driven by increased demand, partially offset by lower realized prices due to unfavorable segment mix and higher contracted rebates. revenue outside the u.s. increased 12 percent, driven by increased volume, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, lower realized prices. we experienced intermittent delays in fulfilling certain u.s. trulicity orders during the second half of 2022. actions to manage strong demand across our incretin portfolio, including measures to minimize existing patient impact in international markets, also affected volume in 2022. revenue of verzenio increased 98 percent in the u.s., primarily driven by increased demand. revenue outside the u.s. increased 61 percent, driven by increased demand, partially offset by lower realized prices primarily due to the impact of the nrdl formulary in china and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. revenue of taltz increased 12 percent in the u.s., driven by increased demand, partially offset by lower realized prices. revenue outside the u.s. increased 13 percent, driven by increased volume, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower realized prices. revenue of jardiance increased 48 percent in the u.s., primarily driven by increased demand. revenue outside the u.s. increased 28 percent, primarily driven by increased demand, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our collaboration with boehringer ingelheim involving jardiance. revenue of humalog decreased 10 percent in the u.s., primarily driven by lower realized prices due to a list price reduction of insulin lispro injection and unfavorable segment mix, partially offset by changes to estimates for rebates and discounts in 2021. revenue outside the u.s. decreased 23 percent, primarily driven by lower realized prices due to the impact of vbp in china and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. due to the impact of competition and pricing pressure in the u.s. and certain international markets, we expect that lower revenue for humalog due to realized price decline will continue over time. see \"-executive overview-other matters-patent matters\" for additional information. revenue of covid-19 antibodies was $2.01 billion in the u.s. during the year ended december 31, 2022, primarily due to bebtelovimab supplied to the u.s. government. covid-19 antibodies are not currently authorized for emergency use in the u.s. we do not currently expect significant further revenue attributable to the treatment of covid-19. revenue of alimta decreased 56 percent in the u.s., primarily driven by decreased demand due to the entry of multiple generics in the first half of 2022. revenue outside the u.s. decreased 54 percent, primarily driven by decreased demand due to generic competition. following the expiration of patent exclusivity for alimta in europe and japan in june 2021, we have faced generic competition that has rapidly and severely eroded revenue from prior levels, and we expect such competition will continue to erode revenues from current levels in these markets. in addition, as a result of the entry of multiple generics in the u.s. following the expiration of patent and pediatric exclusivity in the first half of 2022, we began facing, and expect to continue to face, generic competition that has rapidly and severely eroded revenue from prior levels, and we expect will continue to erode revenue from current levels. see \"-executive overview-other matters-patent matters\" for additional information. gross margin, costs, and expenses gross margin as a percent of revenue was 76.8 percent in 2022, an increase of 2.6 percentage points compared with 2021, primarily driven by a net inventory impairment charge related to our covid-19 antibodies recognized in 2021 and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold in 2021. additionally, in 2022, favorable product mix, including the impact of lower sales of covid-19 antibodies and olumiant for the treatment of covid-19, were offset by lower realized prices and increased expenses due to inflation and logistics costs. research and development expenses increased 4 percent to $7.19 billion in 2022, driven primarily by higher development expenses for late-stage assets, partially offset by lower development expenses for covid-19 antibodies and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. marketing, selling, and administrative expenses remained relatively flat at $6.44 billion in 2022, as increased costs associated with launches of new products and indications were offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. we have undertaken compensatory actions to improve retention and address wage inflation, which will increase compensation costs and impact our consolidated results of operations. we recognized acquired ipr&d and development milestones of $908.5 million in 2022 that included the buy-out of substantially all future obligations that were contingent upon the occurrence of certain events linked to the success of our mutant-selective pi3kα inhibitor and a purchase of a priority review voucher. we recognized acquired ipr&d and development milestones of $970.1 million in 2021 that included charges resulting from business development transactions with foghorn, rigel, and precision. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. we recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $244.6 million in 2022, primarily related to an intangible asset impairment for gba1 gene therapy (pr001) due to changes in estimated launch timing. we recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $316.1 million in 2021, primarily related to an impairment of a contract-based intangible asset from our acquisition of loxo, an intangible asset impairment resulting from the sale of the rights to qbrexza, as well as acquisition and integration costs associated with the acquisition of prevail. other-net, (income) expense was expense of $320.9 million in 2022, primarily driven by net investment losses on equity securities. other-net, (income) expense was expense of $201.6 million in 2021, primarily driven by a debt extinguishment loss of $405.2 million related to the repurchase of debt, partially offset by net investment gains on equity securities. our effective tax rate was 8.3 percent in 2022, reflecting the favorable tax impact of the implementation of a provision in the 2017 tax act that requires capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses for tax purposes starting in 2022, partially offset by the tax impact of the mix of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. our effective tax rate was 9.3 percent in 2021, reflecting the favorable tax impacts of acquired ipr&d and development milestone charges, net investment gains on equity securities, and a net discrete tax benefit. operating results-2021 for a discussion of our results of operations pertaining to 2021 and 2020 see item 7, \"management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition\" in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2021. financial condition and liquidity we believe our available cash and cash equivalents, together with our ability to generate operating cash flow and our access to short-term and long-term borrowings, are sufficient to fund our existing and planned capital requirements, which include: •working capital requirements, including related to employee payroll, clinical trials, manufacturing materials, and taxes; •capital expenditures; •share repurchases and dividends; •repayment of outstanding short-term and long-term borrowings; •contributions to our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans; •milestone and royalty payments; and •potential business development activities, including acquisitions, collaborations, investments, and licensing arrangements. our management continuously evaluates our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can adequately and efficiently finance our capital requirements. as of december 31, 2022, our material cash requirements primarily related to purchases of goods and services to produce our products and conduct our operations, capital expenditures, dividends, repayment of outstanding borrowings, milestone and royalty payments, the remaining obligations for the one-time repatriation transition tax (also known as the 'toll tax') from the 2017 tax act, leases, unfunded commitments to invest in venture capital funds, and retirement benefits (see notes 11, 4, 14, 10, 7, and 15 to the consolidated financial statements). we anticipate our cash requirements related to ordinary course purchases of goods and services will be consistent with our past levels relative to revenues. in 2022, we committed to invest over several years more than $2 billion in two new facilities in lebanon, indiana to manufacture existing and future products, more than $1 billion in a new facility in concord, north carolina to manufacture parenteral (injectable) products and devices, and more than 400 million euro in a new facility in limerick, ireland to expand our manufacturing network for biologic active ingredients. in early 2023, we committed to invest an additional $450 million to expand manufacturing capacity at research triangle park facility in durham, north carolina for additional parenteral filling, device assembly, and packaging capacity. these investments, and other capital investments that support our operations, will result in higher capital expenditures for the next several years. the 2017 tax act contained a provision that requires us to capitalize and amortize research and development expenses for tax purposes starting in 2022, whereas previously we could fully deduct these expenses in the year incurred. the implementation of this provision increased our cash payments of income taxes by approximately $1.20 billion in 2022. while the implementation of this provision will continue to increase our cash payments of income taxes, the increase will moderately decrease from 2022 levels over the five-year amortization period. see \"-executive overview-other matters-tax matters\" for additional information. cash and cash equivalents decreased to $2.07 billion as of december 31, 2022, compared with $3.82 billion at december 31, 2021. net cash provided by operating activities was $7.08 billion in 2022, compared with $7.26 billion in 2021. refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional information on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021. in addition to our cash and cash equivalents, we held total investments of $3.05 billion and $3.30 billion as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. in december 2022, we acquired all shares of akouos, inc. (akouos) for a purchase price that included $12.50 per share in cash (or an aggregate of $327.2 million, net of cash acquired) plus one non-tradable contingent value right (cvr) per share. the cvr entitles akouos shareholders up to an additional $3.00 per share in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $122 million) payable, subject to certain terms and conditions, upon the achievement of certain specified milestones. this acquisition was funded through cash on hand. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. as of december 31, 2022, total debt was $16.24 billion, a decrease of $646.1 million compared with $16.88 billion at december 31, 2021. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. as of december 31, 2022, we had a total of $7.33 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $7.00 billion of which is available to support our commercial paper program. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. we believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short-term borrowing needs. dividends of $3.92 per share and $3.40 per share were paid in 2022 and 2021, respectively. the quarterly dividend was increased to $1.13 per share effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2023, resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2023 of $4.52 per share. capital expenditures were $1.85 billion during 2022, compared to $1.31 billion in 2021. in 2022, we repurchased $1.50 billion of shares under our $5.00 billion share repurchase program authorized in may 2021. as of december 31, 2022, we had $3.25 billion remaining under this program. see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. see \"-executive overview-other matters-patent matters\" for information regarding recent losses of patent protection. both domestically and abroad, we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment; the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers, including foreign government-backed agencies and suppliers; the uncertain impact of healthcare legislation; and various international government funding levels. in the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, currency values, and fair values of equity securities. these fluctuations impact the costs of financing, investing, and operating. we seek to address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. the objective of this risk management program is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. all derivative activities are for purposes other than trading. our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term u.s. dollar interest rates. in an effort to manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. as of december 31, 2022, substantially all of our total long-term debt carries interest at a fixed rate. we have converted approximately 10 percent of our long-term fixed-rate notes to floating rates through the use of interest rate swaps. based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31, 2022 and 2021, including derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period. our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the u.s. dollar against the euro, japanese yen, and chinese yuan. we face foreign currency exchange exposures when we enter into transactions arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies. we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the u.s. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. we may enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates (primarily the euro, the japanese yen, and chinese yuan). our corporate risk-management policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. gains and losses on these derivative contracts offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets and liabilities. we periodically analyze the fair values of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts to determine their sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates. a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the u.s. dollar) applied to the fair values of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or financial position over a one-year period. this sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in exchange rates would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions. our fair value risk exposure relates primarily to our public equity investments and to equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values. as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, our carrying values of these investments were $1.16 billion and $1.83 billion, respectively. a hypothetical 20 percent change in fair value of the equity instruments would have impacted other-net, (income) expense by $232.4 million and $365.6 million as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. we acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels). if required by the arrangement, we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained. individually, these arrangements are generally not material in any one annual reporting period. however, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate expense or aggregate milestone payments made could be material to our results of operations or cash flows, respectively, in that period. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives. we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products. as we expand our manufacturing capacity in order to meet existing and expected demand of our incretin products, we have entered, and expect to continue to enter, into various agreements for contract manufacturing and for supply of materials. the executed agreements could, under certain circumstances, require us to pay up to approximately $4.5 billion if we do not purchase specified amounts of goods or services over the durations of the agreements, which generally range from 2 to 8 years. application of critical accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s., we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. for any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. we believe that, given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below. revenue recognition and sales return, rebate, and discount accruals background and uncertainties we recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts, product sales to customers (net product revenue) and collaborations and other arrangements. for product sales to customers, provisions for returns, rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized. to determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer, we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. significant judgments are required in making these estimates. the largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts include rebates associated with sales covered by managed care, medicare, medicaid, and chargeback programs, as well as reductions in revenue related to our patient assistance programs, in the u.s. in determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs, as well as patient assistance program costs, by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and product launches), an evaluation of the current contracts for these programs, the percentage of our products that are sold via these programs, and our product pricing. refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on revenue recognition and sales return, rebate, and discount accruals. revenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements will include our share of profits from the collaboration, as well as royalties, upfront and milestone payments we receive under these types of contracts. financial statement impact we believe that our accruals for sales returns, rebates, and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. our rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. our sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. as of december 31, 2022, a 5 percent change in our consolidated sales return, rebate, and discount liability would result in a change in revenue of approximately $464 million. the portion of our consolidated sales return, rebate, and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the u.s. was approximately 90 percent as of december 31, 2022 and 2021. the following represents a roll-forward of our most significant u.s. sales return, rebate, and discount liability balances, including managed care, medicare, medicaid, chargeback, and patient assistance programs: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, beginning of year $6,161.6 $5,400.0 reduction of net sales(1) 28,398.4 20,106.3 cash payments (26,345.9) (19,344.7) sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, end of year $8,214.1 $6,161.6 (1) adjustments of the estimates for these returns, rebates, and discounts to actual results were less than 1 percent of consolidated revenue for each of the years presented. increase in reduction of net sales in 2022 was primarily driven by our incretin products due to increase in our patient assistance programs and in volume of rebates for managed care, medicare and medicaid programs. litigation liabilities and other contingencies background and uncertainties litigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by their nature, uncertain and based upon complex judgments and probabilities. the factors we consider in developing our litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and the number of other similar current and past matters, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation, as applicable, and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions, if any. in addition, we accrue for certain liability claims incurred, but not filed, to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. in assessing our insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company, the financial condition of the insurers, and the possibility of and length of time for collection. due to a very restrictive market for litigation liability insurance, we are self-insured for litigation liability losses for all our currently marketed products. in addition to insurance coverage, we consider any third-party indemnification to which we are entitled or under which we are obligated. with respect to our third-party indemnification rights, these considerations include the nature of the indemnification, the financial condition of the indemnifying party, and the possibility of and length of time for collection. the litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. acquisitions background and uncertainties to determine whether acquisitions or licensing transactions should be accounted for as a business combination or as an asset acquisition, we make certain judgments, which include assessing whether the acquired set of activities and assets would meet the definition of a business under the relevant accounting rules. if the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are required to be recorded at their respective fair values on our consolidated balance sheet as of the acquisition date. the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, is recorded as goodwill. if the acquired set of activities and assets does not meet the definition of a business, the transaction is recorded as an acquisition of assets and, therefore, any acquired ipr&d that does not have an alternative future use is charged to acquired ipr&d and development milestones on our consolidated statement of operations at the acquisition date, and goodwill is not recorded. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. the judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, as well as estimated asset lives, can materially affect our consolidated results of operations. the fair values of intangible assets, including acquired ipr&d, are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. significant estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, probability of technical success, revenue projections, and discount rate. depending on the facts and circumstances, we may deem it necessary to engage an independent valuation expert to assist in valuing significant assets and liabilities. the fair values of identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using an \"income method,\" as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. the fair value of any contingent consideration liability that results from a business combination is primarily determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, as described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. estimating the fair value of contingent consideration requires the use of significant estimates and judgments, including, but not limited to, probability of technical success and the discount rate. financial statement impact as of december 31, 2022, a 5 percent change in the contingent consideration liabilities would result in a change in income before income taxes of $5.5 million. impairment of indefinite-lived and long-lived assets background and uncertainties we review the carrying value of long-lived assets (both intangible and tangible) for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. we identify impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset (or asset group) to its carrying value. if an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset's net book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted. goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value is performed to determine the amount of any impairment. several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of acquired ipr&d, all of which require multiple assumptions. we utilize the \"income method,\" as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. for acquired ipr&d assets, the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product, as discussed previously in \"-executive overview-late-stage pipeline.\" the nature of the pharmaceutical business is high-risk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to maintain a successful portfolio of approved products. as such, it is likely that some acquired ipr&d assets will become impaired in the future. estimates of future cash flows, based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management's judgment. actual results could vary materially from these estimates. retirement benefits assumptions background and uncertainties defined benefit pension plan and retiree health benefit plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, and retirement age. these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. in addition to the analysis below, see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits. annually, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. we use an actuarially determined, plan-specific yield curve of high quality, fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates. in evaluating the expected return on plan assets, we consider many factors, with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions, asset returns and asset allocations (approximately 70 percent of which are growth investments), and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. we may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results, as well as the discount rates and expected return on plan assets of other companies, where applicable. in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages. annually, we determine the fair value of the plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. approximately 50 percent of our plan assets are in hedge funds and private equity-like investment funds (collectively, alternative assets). we value these alternative investments using significant unobservable inputs or using the net asset value reported by the counterparty, adjusted as necessary. inputs include underlying net asset values, discounted cash flows valuations, comparable market valuations, and adjustments for currency, credit, liquidity and other risks. financial statement impact if the 2022 discount rate for the u.s. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans (u.s. plans) were to change by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $23.8 million. if the 2022 expected return on plan assets for u.s. plans were to change by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $33.5 million. if our assumption regarding the 2022 expected age of future retirees for u.s. plans were adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be affected by $46.3 million. the u.s. plans, including puerto rico, represent approximately 85 percent of each of the total projected benefit obligation and total plan assets at december 31, 2022. adjustments to the fair value of plan assets are not recognized in pension and retiree health benefit expense in the year that the adjustments occur. such changes are deferred, along with other actuarial gains and losses, and are amortized into expense over the expected remaining service life of employees. income taxes background and uncertainties we file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and we record estimates in our financial statements based upon these interpretations at the applicable tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. our tax returns are routinely subject to examination by taxing authorities, which could result in future tax, interest, and penalty assessments. inherent uncertainties also exist in estimates of many tax positions due to the complexity of tax laws. we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances such as changes to existing tax law, the issuance of regulations by taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of a tax examination. we believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are both appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. we recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses, tax credits, and other tax carryforwards and carrybacks in certain taxing jurisdictions. in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets, we have not assumed future taxable income in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption. implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or to generate future taxable income in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of all or a portion of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. financial statement impact as of december 31, 2022, a 5 percent change in the amount of uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of $85.0 million and $38.8 million, respectively. legal and regulatory matters information relating to certain legal proceedings can be found in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements and is incorporated here by reference.\"\"\"\n\n    Instruction:\n

organizational resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” (vogus & sutcliffe, 2007: 3418). organizational resilience is defined as the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity. resilience can be defined as the system’s ability to maintain its integrity and its performance, at least partially, while under internal or external variations and disturbances (i.e. pressures, constraints, failures, errors, violations, hazards), whether nominal, extreme, or exceptional. defined as a company’s ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from a challenging situation. we develop a trajectory model of organizational resilience that focuses on how actors project temporal trajectories of responses toward disruptive events, reconstitute the trajectories in immediate response to the event, and reconfigure the trajectories toward the ensuing future. the concept of resilience draws attention to systems as well as individuals, to partial maintenance of integrity and performance, to the opposite of brittleness, and to disturbances that vary both in scale and source. resilience is a multifaceted concept that reflects businesses’ ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change to survive, grow, and flourish.\"\"\"\n\n    Text:\n    \"\"\"item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management's discussion and analysis of

organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. we operate in a complex and evolving global security environment. our strategy consists of the design and development of platforms and systems that meet the future requirements of 21st century security. our vision for 21st century security is to accelerate the adoption of advanced networking and leading-edge technologies into our national defense enterprise, while enhancing the performance and value of our platforms and products for our customers. the aim of 21st century security is to integrate new and existing systems across all domains with advanced, open-architecture networking and operational technologies to make forces more agile, adaptive and unpredictable. 21st century security is an overarching vision that will guide our investment and strategy and we are also focused on four elements for potential growth in the near to mid-term: current programs of record, classified programs, hypersonics and new awards. we have multiple programs of record from each business segment that are entering growth stages, including the f-35 sustainment activity (aeronautics), increased pac-3 production rates (missiles and fire control), ch-53k heavy lift helicopter (rotary and mission systems), and the modernization and enhancements to the trident ii d5 fleet ballistic missile (space). we are engaged in significant classified development programs and pending successful achievement of the objectives within those programs, we expect to begin the transition from development to production over the next few years. we are currently performing on multiple hypersonic programs and following the successful completion of ongoing testing and evaluation activity, multiple programs are expected to enter early production phases between 2023 and 2026. finally, we are always in pursuit of new program awards to develop future platforms that enable us to continue to place security capability into the market and expand our global reach. key to enabling success of our strategy is developing differentiating technologies, forging strategic partnerships, including with commercial companies, executing on our multi-year business transformation initiative to enhance our digital infrastructure and increase efficiencies and collaboration throughout our business and maintaining fiscal discipline. underpinning our ability to execute our strategy is our talent and culture. we invest substantially in our people to ensure that our workforce has the technical skills necessary to succeed, and we expect to continue to invest internally in innovative technologies that address rapidly evolving mission requirements for our customers. we also will continue to evaluate our portfolio and will make strategic acquisitions or divestitures, as appropriate, while deepening our connection to commercial industry through cooperative partnerships, joint ventures, and equity investments. covid-19 covid-19 continued to cause business impacts in 2022. the emergence of the omicron variant in late 2021 and resulting increase in covid-19 cases in early 2022 adversely impacted our operations and our supply chain. our performance was affected during 2022 by supply chain disruptions and delays, as well as labor challenges associated with employee absences, travel restrictions, site access, quarantine restrictions, remote work, and adjusted work schedules. the recovery from table of contents that disruption has been slower than originally anticipated, in particular within our supply chain, and some of those supply chain impacts are expected to continue into 2023. attendance for employees required to be onsite fluctuated during 2022 based on covid-19 developments. we are actively engaging with our customers and are continuing to take measures to protect the health and safety of our employees. in our on-going effort to mitigate supply chain risks, we accelerated payments of $1.5 billion to our suppliers as of december 31, 2022, that are due according to contractual terms in future periods, while consistently prioritizing small businesses, which make up over half of our active supply base, as well as at-risk businesses. additionally, we have deployed resources at supplier sites to improve oversight and performance. we will continue to monitor supply chain risks, especially at small and at-risk related suppliers, and may continue to utilize accelerated payments in 2023 on an as needed basis. the impact of covid-19 on our operations and financial performance in future periods, including our ability to execute our programs in the expected timeframe, remains uncertain and will depend on a number of factors, including the impact of potential new covid-19 variants or subvariants, the effectiveness and adoption of covid-19 vaccines and therapeutics, and supplier impacts and related government actions to prevent and manage disease spread,. the long-term impacts of covid-19 on government budgets and other funding priorities, including international priorities, that impact demand for our products and services also are difficult to predict, but could negatively affect our future results and performance. inflation heightened levels of inflation and the potential worsening of macro-economic conditions present risks for lockheed martin, our suppliers and the stability of the broader defense industrial base. during 2022, we have experienced impacts to our labor rates and suppliers have signaled inflation related cost pressures, which will flow through to our costs and pricing. although inflation did not significantly impact our financial results in 2022, if inflation remains at current levels for an extended period, or increases, and we are unable to successfully mitigate the impact, our costs are likely to increase, resulting in pressure on our profits, margins and cash flows, particularly for existing fixed-price contracts. for new contract proposals, we are factoring into our pricing heightened levels of inflation based on accepted dod escalation indices and other assumptions, and in some cases seeking the inclusion of economic price adjustment (epa) clauses, which would permit, subject to the particular contractual terms, cost adjustments in fixed-price contracts for unexpected inflation. in addition, inflation and the increases in the cost of borrowing from rising interest rates could constrain the overall purchasing power of our customers for our products and services, in particular in the near term to the extent inflation assumptions are less than current inflationary pressures. rising interest rates will also increase our borrowing costs on new debt and could affect the fair value of our investments. while rising interest rates reduce the measure of our gross pension obligations, they can also lead to decline in pension plan assets with offsetting impacts on our net pension liability. we remain committed to our ongoing efforts to increase the efficiency of our operations and improve the cost competitiveness and affordability of our products and services, which may, in part, offset cost increases from inflation. conflict in ukraine russia's invasion of ukraine has significantly elevated global geopolitical tensions and security concerns. as a result, we have received increased interest for some of our products and services as countries seek to improve their security posture, particularly in europe. in addition, security assistance provided by the u.s. government to ukraine has created u.s. government demand to replenish u.s. stockpiles, resulting in additional and potential future orders for our products. we are beginning to see this interest result in initiation of new contract discussions, however, given the long-cycle nature of our business and current industry capacity, we do not expect a significant increase in near term sales from new contracts in response to the conflict. we are evaluating capacity at our operations and the supply chain to anticipate potential demand and enable us to deliver critical capabilities. in addition, the u.s. government and other nations have implemented broad economic sanctions and export controls targeting russia, which combined with the conflict have the potential to indirectly disrupt our supply chain and access to certain resources. we have not, however, experienced significant adverse impacts to date and we will continue to monitor for any impacts and seek to mitigate disruption that may arise. the conflict also has increased the threat of malicious cyber activity from nation states and other actors. we have taken steps designed to enhance our defensive posture against tactics and techniques associated with this increased threat. portfolio shaping activities we continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. we accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activities and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities. we selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses, investments and ventures at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. we also may explore the divestiture of table of contents businesses, investments or ventures that no longer meet our needs or strategy or that could perform better outside of our organization or with a different owner. in pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and equity investments. renationalization of the atomic weapons establishment program on june 30, 2021, the uk ministry of defence terminated the contract to operate the uk's nuclear deterrent program and assumed control of the entity that manages the program (referred to as the renationalization of the atomic weapons establishment (awe program)). accordingly, the awe program's ongoing operations, including the entity that manages the program, are no longer included in our financial results as of that date. therefore, during 2021, awe only generated sales of $885 million and operating profit of $18 million, which are included in space's financial results for the year ended december 31, 2021. during the year ended december 31, 2020, awe generated sales of $1.4 billion and operating profit of $35 million, which are included in space's financial results for 2020. u.s. government funding on march 28, 2022 the administration submitted to congress the president's fiscal year (fy) 2023 budget request, which proposed $813.4 billion in total national defense spending, of which $773 billion was for the base budget of the department of defense (dod). on december 29, 2022, the president signed the fy 2023 omnibus appropriations act into law, which provides $858 billion in total national defense funding, of which $816.7 billion is for the dod base budget. this reflects a $44.6 billion increase over the fy 2023 request for national defense spending, and a $43.7 billion increase for the dod. the fy 2023 omnibus appropriations act also provided separate and additional funding of $47 billion for ukraine, the fourth supplemental since march of 2022, bringing the total amount of supplemental funding authority provided to $113 billion. the president's fy 2024 budget request is anticipated to be submitted to congress in march 2023, initiating the fy 2024 defense authorization and appropriations legislative process. in addition to the fy 2024 budget process, congress will have to contend with the legal limit on u.s. debt, commonly known as the debt ceiling. the current statutory limit of $31.4 trillion was reached in january, requiring the treasury department to take accounting measures to continue normally financing u.s. government obligations while avoiding exceeding the debt ceiling. it is expected, however, the u.s. government will exhaust these measures by june 2023. if the debt ceiling is not raised, the u.s. government may not be able to fulfill its funding obligations and there could be significant disruption to all discretionary programs and wider financial and economic repercussions. the federal budget and debt ceiling are expected to continue to be the subject of considerable congressional debate. although we believe dod, intelligence, and homeland security programs will continue to receive consensus support for increased funding and would likely receive priority if this scenario came to fruition, the effect on individual programs or lockheed martin cannot be predicted at this time. international business a key component of our strategic plan is to grow our international sales. to accomplish this growth, we continue to focus on strengthening our relationships internationally through partnerships and joint technology efforts. our international business is conducted either by foreign military sales (fms) contracted through the u.s. government or by direct commercial sales (dcs) to international customers. in 2022, approximately 74% of our sales to international customers were fms and about 26% were dcs. additionally, in 2022, substantially all of our sales from international customers were in our aeronautics, mfc and rms business segments. space's sales from international customers were not material in 2022. see item 1a - risk factors for a discussion of risks related to international sales. in 2022, international customers accounted for 33% of aeronautics' net sales. there continues to be strong international interest in the f-35 program, which includes commitments from the u.s. government and seven international partner countries and nine fms customers, as well as expressions of interest from other countries. the u.s. government and the partner countries continue to work together on the design, testing, production, and sustainment of the f-35 program. other areas of international expansion at our aeronautics business segment include the f-16 and c-130j programs, which continue to draw interest from international customers for new aircraft. in 2022, international customers accounted for 31% of mfc's net sales. our mfc business segment continues to generate significant international interest, most notably in the air and missile defense product line, which produces the patriot advanced capability-3 (pac-3) and terminal high altitude area defense (thaad) systems. fourteen nations have chosen pac-3 cost reduction initiative (cri) and pac-3 missile segment enhancement (mse) to provide missile defense capabilities. table of contents additionally, we continue to see international demand for our tactical and strike missile products, where we received orders for precision fires systems from germany and taiwan and for long range anti-ship missiles (lrasm) from australia. in 2022, international customers accounted for 28% of rms' net sales. our rms business segment continues to experience international interest in the aegis ballistic missile defense system (aegis) for which we perform activities in the development, production, modernization, ship integration, test and lifetime support for ships of international customers such as japan, spain, republic of korea, and australia. we have ongoing combat systems programs associated with different classes of surface combatant ships for customers in canada, chile, and new zealand. our multi-mission surface combatant (mmsc) program will provide surface combatant ships for international customers, such as the kingdom of saudi arabia, designed to operate in shallow waters and the open ocean. in our training and logistics solutions portfolio, we have active programs and pursuits in the united kingdom, the kingdom of saudi arabia, canada, singapore, australia, germany and france. we have active development, production, and sustainment support of the s-70 black hawk and mh-60 seahawk helicopters to international customers, including india, philippines, australia, republic of korea, thailand, the kingdom of saudi arabia, and greece. additionally, in december 2021, the israeli ministry of defense signed a letter of offer and acceptance (loa) to procure 12 ch-53k king stallion heavy lift helicopters, of which the first four were awarded in 2022. commercial aircraft are sold to international customers to support search and rescue missions as well as vip and offshore oil and gas transportation. status of the f-35 program the f-35 program primarily consists of production contracts, sustainment activities, and new development efforts. production of the aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the u.s. government's current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the u.s. air force, u.s. marine corps, and u.s. navy; commitments from our seven international partner countries and nine foreign military sales (fms) customers; as well as interest from other countries. we saw strong international demand for the f-35 in 2022. during the first quarter of 2022, finland became the seventh fms customer to join the program. during the second quarter of 2022, the government of canada selected lockheed martin and the f-35 as the preferred bidder to move into the finalization phase of the competitive process to replace its fighter fleet. as a result of the finalization phase, the government of canada recently announced in january 2023 their commitment to purchase 88 f-35 aircraft. during the third quarter of 2022, the swiss government signed a letter of offer and acceptance for the procurement of 36 f-35 aircraft and became the eighth fms customer to join the program. during the fourth quarter of 2022, the german government signed a letter of offer and acceptance for the procurement of 35 f-35 aircraft and became the ninth fms customer to join the program. during the fourth quarter of 2022, we finalized the f-35 low rate initial production (lrip) lots 15-17 production contract with the u.s. government for up to 398 aircraft. the agreement includes 145 aircraft for lot 15, 127 for lot 16 and up to 126 for a lot 17 contract option. in 2022 we delivered 141 aircraft and had a backlog of 345 production aircraft, including orders from our international partner countries and fms customers. since program inception we have delivered 894 production f-35 aircraft to u.s. and international customers, including 648 f-35a variants, 178 f-35b variants, and 68 f-35c variants, demonstrating the f-35 program's continued progress and longevity. covid-19 and other impacts experienced by the f-35 enterprise have continued to impact our near-term production plans. at the end of 2022, there was an issue with the government furnished equipment (gfe) engine that resulted in a pause in flight operations and 2022 aircraft deliveries were impacted. the delivery pause continues as flight operations remain on hold and concurrently, gfe engine deliveries have been suspended. we will have greater clarity if changes to our 2023 aircraft delivery expectation are required once the pause in flight operations and the gfe engine delivery suspension have been resolved. as of january 2023, we plan on producing 147-153 aircraft in 2023 and 2024, and 2023 deliveries will be determined pending the resumption of engine deliveries and other factors. we anticipate annual deliveries of 156 aircraft in 2025 and for the foreseeable future. given the size and complexity of the f-35 program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft performance, program, and delivery schedule, cost, and requirements as part of the dod, congressional, and international countries' oversight, and budgeting processes. current program challenges include our and our suppliers' performance (including covid-19 performance-related challenges), software development, execution of future flight tests and findings resulting from testing and operating the aircraft, the level of cost associated with life cycle operations, sustainment and potential contractual obligations, inflation-related cost pressures, and the ability to improve affordability. backlog at december 31, 2022, our backlog was $150.0 billion compared with $135.4 billion at december 31, 2021. backlog is converted into sales in future periods as work is performed or deliveries are made. we expect to recognize approximately 37% table of contents of our backlog over the next 12 months and approximately 61% over the next 24 months as revenue, with the remainder recognized thereafter. our backlog includes both funded (firm orders for our products and services for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer) and unfunded (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated) amounts. we do not include unexercised options or potential orders under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (idiq) agreements in our backlog. if any of our contracts with firm orders were to be terminated, our backlog would be reduced by the expected value of the unfilled orders of such contracts. funded backlog was $95.5 billion at december 31, 2022, as compared to $88.5 billion at december 31, 2021. for backlog related to each of our business segments, see below. consolidated results of operations our operating cycle is primarily long term and involves many types of contracts for the design, development and manufacture of products and related activities with varying delivery schedules. consequently, the results of operations of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of sales and profits, may not be indicative of future operating results. the following discussions of comparative results among years should be reviewed in this context. all per share amounts cited in these discussions are presented on a \"per diluted share\" basis, unless otherwise noted. our consolidated results of operations were as follows (in millions, except per share data): 2022 2021 2020 net sales $65,984 $67,044 $65,398 cost of sales (57,697) (57,983) (56,744) gross profit 8,287 9,061 8,654 other income (expense), net 61 62 (10) operating profit

operations before income taxes 6,680 7,550 8,235 income tax expense (948) (1,235) (1,347) net earnings from continuing operations 5,732 6,315 6,888 net loss from discontinued operations - - (55) net earnings $5,732 $6,315 $6,833 diluted earnings (loss) per common share continuing operations $21.66 $22.76 $24.50 discontinued operations - - (0.20) total diluted earnings per common share $21.66 $22.76 $24.30 certain amounts reported in other income (expense), net, including our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees, are included in the operating profit of our business segments. accordingly, such amounts are included in the discussion of our business segment results of operations. table of contents net sales we generate sales from the delivery of products and services to our customers. our consolidated net sales were as follows (in millions): 2022 2021 2020 products $55,466 $56,435 $54,928 % of total net sales 84.1 % 84.2 % 84.0 % services 10,518 10,609 10,470 % of total net sales 15.9 % 15.8 % 16.0 % total net sales $65,984 $67,044 $65,398 substantially all of our contracts are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method. under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method, we record net sales on contracts over time based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract, as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. the following discussion of material changes in our consolidated net sales should be read in tandem with the subsequent discussion of changes in our consolidated cost of sales and our business segment results of operations because changes in our sales are typically accompanied by a corresponding change in our cost of sales due to the nature of the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method. overall, our sales were negatively affected in 2022 because of supply chain impacts. product sales product sales decreased $1.0 billion, or 2%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. the decrease is primarily attributable to lower product sales of approximately $670 million at rms mostly due to lower production volume on black hawk and lower net sales for training and logistics solutions (tls) programs due to the delivery of an international pilot training system in the first quarter of 2021; about $315 million at space primarily due to the renationalization of awe on june 30, 2021, partially offset by higher development volume (next generation interceptor (ngi)); and approximately $220 million at mfc primarily due to lower volume on terminal high altitude area defense (thaad) and air dominance weapon systems. these decreases were partially offset by higher product sales of about $240 million at aeronautics mostly due to higher volume on classified contracts that were partially offset by lower volume on f-35 contracts. service sales service sales decreased $91 million, or 1%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. the decrease in service sales was primarily due to lower sales of approximately $155 million at mfc primarily due to lower volume on the special operations forces global logistics support services (sof glss) program. cost of sales cost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, subcontracting costs and an allocation of indirect costs (overhead and general and administrative), as well as the costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers. for each of our contracts, we monitor the nature and amount of costs at the contract level, which form the basis for estimating our total costs to complete the contract. our consolidated cost of sales were as follows (in millions): 2022 2021 2020 cost of sales - products $(49,577) $(50,273) $(48,996) % of product sales 89.4 % 89.1 % 89.2 % cost of sales - services (9,280) (9,463) (9,371) % of service sales 88.2 % 89.2 % 89.5 % severance and other charges (100) (36) (27) other unallocated, net 1,260 1,789 1,650 total cost of sales $(57,697) $(57,983) $(56,744) the following discussion of material changes in our consolidated cost of sales for products and services should be read in tandem with the preceding discussion of changes in our consolidated net sales and our business segment results of operations. except for potential impacts to our programs resulting from covid-19, supply chain disruptions and inflation, we have not table of contents identified any additional developing trends in cost of sales for products and services that would have a material impact on our future operations. product costs product costs decreased approximately $696 million, or 1%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. the decrease was primarily attributable to lower product costs of approximately $525 million at rms mostly due to lower production volume on black hawk and the delivery of an international pilot training system in the first quarter of 2021; about $195 million at mfc primarily due to lower volume on air dominance weapon systems and thaad; and approximately $165 million at space primarily due to the renationalization of awe, partially offset by higher development volume (ngi). these decreases were partially offset by higher product costs of about $185 million at aeronautics mostly due to higher volume on classified contracts that were partially offset by lower volume on f-35 contracts. service costs service costs decreased approximately $183 million, or 2%, in 2022 compared to 2021. the decrease was primarily attributable to lower service costs of approximately $160 million at mfc primarily due to lower volume on the sof glss program. severance and other charges during the fourth quarter of 2022, we recorded charges totaling $100 million ($79 million, or $0.31 per share, after-tax) that relate to actions at our rms business segment, which include severance costs for reduction of positions and asset impairment charges. after a strategic review of rms, these actions will improve the efficiency of our operations, better align the organization and cost structure with changing economic conditions, and changes in program lifecycles. during 2021, we recorded severance and restructuring charges of $36 million ($28 million, or $0.10 per share, after-tax) associated with plans to close and consolidate certain facilities and reduce the total workforce within our rms business segment. other unallocated, net other unallocated, net primarily includes the fas/cas pension operating adjustment (which represents the difference between cas pension cost recorded in our business segments' results of operations and the service cost component of financial accounting standards (fas) pension expense), stock-based compensation expense, changes in the fair value of investments and liabilities for deferred compensation plans and other corporate costs. these items are not allocated to the business segments and, therefore, are not allocated to cost of sales for products or services. other unallocated, net reduced cost of sales by $1.3 billion in 2022, compared to $1.8 billion in 2021. other unallocated, net during 2022 was lower primarily due to a decrease in our fas/cas pension operating adjustment due to lower cas cost from the american rescue plan act of 2021 (arpa) legislation, declines in the fair value of investments and liabilities for deferred compensation plans, and fluctuations in costs associated with various corporate items, none of which were individually significant. see \"business segment results of operations\" and \"critical accounting policies - postretirement benefit plans\" discussion below for more information on our pension cost. other income (expense), net other income (expense), net primarily includes earnings generated by equity method investees. other income, net in 2022 was $61 million, compared to $62 million in 2021. interest expense interest expense in 2022 was $623 million, compared to $569 million in 2021. the increase in interest expense in 2022 resulted primarily from the issuance of notes in october of 2022 to fund share repurchases. see \"capital structure, resources and other\" included within \"liquidity and cash flows\" discussion below and \"note 10 - debt\" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our debt. non-service fas pension (expense) income non-service fas pension expense was $1.0 billion in 2022, compared to $1.3 billion in 2021. non-service fas pension expense in 2022 includes a noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $1.5 billion ($1.2 billion, or $4.33 per share, after-tax), related to the transfer of $4.3 billion of our gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company in the second quarter of 2022. non-service fas pension expense in 2021 includes a noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after-tax), related to the transfer of $4.9 billion of our table of contents gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company in the third quarter of 2021. see \"note 11 - postretirement benefit plans\" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information. other non-operating (expense) income, net other non-operating (expense) income, net primarily includes gains or losses related to changes in the fair value of mark-to-market investments. see \"note 1 - organization and significant accounting policies\" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information. other non-operating expense, net in 2022 was $74 million, compared to other non-operating income, net of $288 million in 2021. the decrease in 2022 was primarily due to decreases in the fair value of certain mark-to-market investments. income tax expense our effective income tax rate was 14.2% for 2022 and 16.4% for 2021. the rate for 2022 was lower than the rate for 2021 primarily due to increased research and development tax credits. the rates for both 2022 and 2021 benefited from tax deductions for foreign derived intangible income, dividends paid to the company's defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature, and employee equity awards. changes in u.s. (federal or state) or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application (including those with retroactive effect), such as the amortization for research or experimental expenditures, could significantly impact our provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, our deferred tax asset and liability balances, and stockholders' equity. in addition to future changes in tax laws, the amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors, including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations, actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans and the change in the amount or reevaluation of uncertain tax positions. beginning in 2022, the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years for tax purposes. this provision resulted in a cash tax liability for the 2022 tax year of approximately $660 million. our net deferred tax assets increased in 2022 by approximately $660 million as a result as well. this provision is expected to increase our 2023 cash tax liability by approximately $575 million. the actual impact on 2023 cash tax liability will depend on the amount of research and development expenses paid or incurred in 2023 among other factors. while the largest impact of this provision will be to 2022 cash tax liability, the impact will continue over the five-year amortization period, but will decrease over the period and be immaterial in year six. as of december 31, 2021, our liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions were not material. as of december 31, 2022, our liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions increased to $1.6 billion with a corresponding increase to net deferred tax assets primarily as a result of the provision described above from the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017. see \"note 9 - income taxes\" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information. we are regularly under audit or examination by tax authorities, including foreign tax authorities (including in, amongst others, australia, canada, india, italy, japan, poland, and the united kingdom). the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could similarly result in unanticipated increases in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flows. on august 16, 2022, the president signed into law the inflation reduction act of 2022 which contained provisions effective january 1, 2023, including a 15% corporate minimum tax and a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks, both of which we expect to be immaterial to our financial results, financial position and cash flows. net earnings we reported net earnings of $5.7 billion ($21.66 per share) in 2022 and $6.3 billion ($22.76 per share) in 2021. both net earnings and earnings per share in 2022 were affected by the factors mentioned above. earnings per share also benefited from a net decrease of approximately 12.8 million weighted average common shares outstanding in 2022, compared to 2021. the reduction in weighted average common shares was a result of share repurchases, partially offset by share issuance under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans. table of contents business segment results of operations we operate in four business segments: aeronautics, mfc, rms and space. we organize our business segments based on the nature of products and services offered. net sales and operating profit of our business segments exclude intersegment sales, cost of sales, and profit as these activities are eliminated in consolidation and not included in management's evaluation of performance of each segment. business segment operating profit includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees as the operating activities of the equity method investees are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments. united launch alliance (ula), results of which are included in our space business segment, is our largest equity method investee. business segment operating profit also excludes the fas/cas pension operating adjustment described below, a portion of corporate costs not considered allowable or allocable to contracts with the u.s. government under the applicable u.s. government cost accounting standards (cas) or federal acquisition regulations (far), and other items not considered part of management's evaluation of segment operating performance such as a portion of management and administration costs, legal fees and settlements, environmental costs, changes in the fair value of certain mark-to-market investments, stock-based compensation expense, changes in the fair value of investments and liabilities for deferred compensation plans, retiree benefits, significant severance actions, significant asset impairments, gains or losses from divestitures, and other miscellaneous corporate activities. excluded items are included in the reconciling item \"unallocated items\" between operating profit from our business segments and our consolidated operating profit. see \"note 1 - organization and significant accounting policies\" for a discussion related to certain factors that may impact the comparability of net sales and operating profit of our business segments. table of contents summary operating results for each of our business segments were as follows (in millions): 2022 2021 2020 net sales aeronautics $26,987 $26,748 $26,266 missiles and fire control 11,317 11,693 11,257 rotary and mission systems 16,148 16,789 15,995 space 11,532 11,814 11,880 total net sales $65,984 $67,044 $65,398 operating profit aeronautics $2,866 $2,799 $2,843 missiles and fire control 1,635 1,648 1,545 rotary and mission systems 1,673 1,798 1,615 space 1,045 1,134 1,149 total business segment operating profit 7,219 7,379 7,152 unallocated items fas/cas pension operating adjustment 1,709 1,960 1,876 severance and other charges (a) (100) (36) (27) other, net (b) (480) (180) (357) total unallocated, net 1,129 1,744 1,492 total consolidated operating profit $8,348 $9,123 $8,644 (a)see \"consolidated results of operations - severance and other charges\" discussion above for information on charges related to certain severance and other actions across our organization. (b)other, net in 2020 includes a noncash impairment charge of $128 million recognized on our investment in the international equity method investee, advanced military maintenance, repair and overhaul center (ammroc). (see \"note 1 - organization and significant accounting policies\" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements for more information). our business segments' results of operations include pension expense only as calculated under u.s. government cost accounting standards (cas), which we refer to as cas pension cost. we recover cas pension and other postretirement benefit plan cost through the pricing of our products and services on u.s. government contracts and, therefore, recognize cas pension cost in each of our business segment's net sales and cost of sales. our consolidated financial statements must present pension and other postretirement benefit plan (expense) income calculated in accordance with financial accounting standards (fas) requirements under u.s. gaap. the operating portion of the total fas/cas pension adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of fas pension (expense) income and total cas pension cost. the non-service fas pension (expense) income components are included in non-service fas pension (expense) income in our consolidated statements of earnings. as a result, to the extent that cas pension cost exceeds the service cost component of fas pension (expense) income, we have a favorable fas/cas pension operating adjustment. table of contents the total fas/cas pension adjustments, including the service and non-service cost components of fas pension (expense) income for our qualified defined benefit pension plans, were as follows (in millions): 2022 2021 2020 total fas (expense) income and cas cost fas pension (expense) income $(1,058) $(1,398) $118 less: cas pension cost 1,796 2,066 1,977 total fas/cas pension adjustment $738 $668 $2,095 service and non-service cost reconciliation

(1,292) 219 total fas/cas pension adjustment $738 $668 $2,095 the total fas/cas pension adjustment in 2022 reflects a noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $1.5 billion ($1.2 billion, or $4.33 per share, after-tax) recognized in connection with the transfer of $4.3 billion of our gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company in the second quarter of 2022. the total fas/cas pension adjustment in 2021 reflects a noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after-tax) recognized in connection with the transfer of $4.9 billion of our gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company in the third quarter of 2021. see \"note 11 - postretirement benefit plans\" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements. the following segment discussions also include information relating to backlog for each segment. backlog was approximately $150.0 billion and $135.4 billion at december 31, 2022 and 2021. these amounts included both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated). backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts. funded backlog was approximately $95.5 billion at december 31, 2022, as compared to $88.5 billion at december 31, 2021. if any of our contracts with firm orders were to be terminated, our backlog would be reduced by the expected value of the unfilled orders of such contracts. management evaluates performance on our contracts by focusing on net sales and operating profit and not by type or amount of operating expense. consequently, our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit, consistent with our approach for managing the business. this approach is consistent throughout the life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance on our contracts in a similar manner through their completion. we regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses. the cost information in the reports is accumulated in a manner specified by the requirements of each contract. for example, cost data provided to a customer for a product would typically align to the subcomponents of that product (such as a wing-box on an aircraft) and for services would align to the type of work being performed (such as aircraft sustainment). our contracts generally allow for the recovery of costs in the pricing of our products and services. most of our contracts are bid and negotiated with our customers under circumstances in which we are required to disclose our estimated total costs to provide the product or service. this approach for negotiating contracts with our u.s. government customers generally allows for recovery of our actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. we also may enter into long-term supply contracts for certain materials or components to coincide with the production schedule of certain products and to ensure their availability at known unit prices. many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. at the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract. the estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract and variable considerations. profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks related to the technical, table of contents schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract. conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase. all of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. for further discussion on fixed-price contracts, see \"note 1 - organization and significant accounting policies\" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements. we have a number of programs that are designated as classified by the u.s. government which cannot be specifically described. the operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs. our net sales are primarily derived from long-term contracts for products and services provided to the u.s. government as well as fms contracted through the u.s. government. we recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. for performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. for performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied. changes in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service levels on individual contracts. volume changes in segment operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract. in addition, comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards completion. increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as favorable profit adjustments, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate and are typically referred to as unfavorable profit adjustments. increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period they are determined and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; covid-19 impacts or supply chain disruptions; restructuring charges (except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results); reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets. our consolidated net profit booking rate adjustments increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.8 billion in 2022 and $2.0 billion in 2021. the consolidated net profit booking rate adjustments in 2022 compared to 2021 decreased primarily due to decreases in profit booking rate adjustments at space, rms and mfc offset by an increase in aeronautics. the consolidated net adjustments for 2022 and 2021 are inclusive of approximately $780 million and $900 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for a classified program at aeronautics, various programs at rms and a ground solutions program at space. we periodically experience performance issues and record losses for certain programs. for further discussion on programs at aeronautics and rms, see \"note 1 - organization and significant accounting policies\" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements for more information. table of contents we have contracted with the canadian government for the canadian maritime helicopter program at our rms business segment that provide for design, development, and production of ch-148 aircraft (the original equipment contract), which is a military variant of the s-92 helicopter, and for logistical support to the fleet (the in service support contract) over an extended time period. the program has experienced performance issues, including delays in the final aircraft deliveries from the original contract requirement, and to date the royal canadian air force's flight hours have been less than originally anticipated, which has impacted program revenues and the recovery of our costs under this program. future sales and recovery of existing and future costs under the program are highly dependent upon achieving a certain number of flight hours, which could be adversely impacted by aircraft availability and performance, and the availability of canadian government resources. we are currently in discussions with the canadian government to potentially restructure certain contractual terms and conditions that may be beneficial to both parties. future performance issues or changes in our estimates due to revised contract scope or customer requirements may affect our ability to recover our costs and may result in a loss that could be material to our operating results. we also have a number of contracts with türkish industry for the türkish utility helicopter program (tuhp), which anticipates co-production with türkish industry for production of t70 helicopters for use in türkiye, as well as the related provision of türkish goods and services under buy-back or offset obligations, to include the future sales of helicopters built in türkiye for sale globally. the u.s. government has imposed certain sanctions on türkish entities and persons that has affected our ability to perform under contracts supporting the türkish utility helicopter program. as a result of the sanctions, we have provided force majeure notices under the affected contracts and these contracts may be restructured or terminated, either in whole or in part, which could result in a further reduction in sales, the imposition of penalties or assessment of damages, and increased unrecoverable costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results. aeronautics our aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. aeronautics' major programs include the f-35 lightning ii, c‐130 hercules, f-16 fighting falcon and f-22 raptor. aeronautics' operating results included the following (in millions): 2022 2021 2020 net sales $26,987 $26,748 $26,266 operating profit 2,866 2,799 2,843 operating margin 10.6 % 10.5 % 10.8 % backlog at year-end $56,630 $49,118 $56,551 aeronautics' net sales in 2022 increased $239 million, or 1%, compared to 2021. net sales increased by approximately $375 million on classified contracts primarily due to higher volume; about $80 million for the f-22 program due to higher net favorable profit adjustments; and approximately $55 million for the f-16 program due to higher volume on production contracts that was partially offset by lower volume on sustainment contracts and unfavorable profit adjustments on a production contract and modernization contracts. these increases were partially offset by a decrease of about $310 million for the f-35 program due to lower volume and favorable profit adjustments on sustainment and production contracts that were partially offset by higher volume on development contracts. aeronautics' operating profit in 2022 increased $67 million, or 2%, compared to 2021. operating profit increased approximately $145 million on classified contracts primarily due to lower unfavorable profit adjustments on a classified program ($45 million in 2022 compared to $225 million in 2021) that were partially offset by lower favorable profit adjustments; and about $100 million for the f-22 program due to higher net favorable profit adjustments. these increases were partially offset by lower operating profit of approximately $110 million for the f-16 program due to unfavorable profit adjustments in 2022 on a production contract and modernization contracts; and about $80 million for the f-35 program due to lower net favorable profit adjustments on production and sustainment contracts and volume on sustainment contracts. net favorable profit booking rate adjustments were $30 million higher in 2022 compared to 2021. backlog backlog increased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to the delay of f-35 lot 15 award from 2021 to 2022 and the award of the f-35 lot 16 contract in december 2022. table of contents missiles and fire control our mfc business segment provides air and missile defense systems; tactical missiles and air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems; logistics; fire control systems; mission operations support, readiness, engineering support and integration services; manned and unmanned ground vehicles; and energy management solutions. mfc's major programs include pac‐3, thaad, multiple launch rocket system (mlrs), hellfire, joint air-to-surface standoff missile (jassm), apache fire control system, sniper advanced targeting pod (sniper®), infrared search and track (irst21®) and special operations forces global logistics support services (sof glss). mfc's operating results included the following (in millions): 2022 2021 2020 net sales $11,317 $11,693 $11,257 operating profit 1,635 1,648 1,545 operating margin 14.4 % 14.1 % 13.7 % backlog at year-end $28,735 $27,021 $29,183 mfc's net sales in 2022 decreased $376 million, or 3%, compared to 2021. the decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of approximately $280 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to lower volume on sof glss as a result of changes in mission requirements and lower volume on sniper®; and about $60 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to lower volume (thaad) and lower net favorable profit adjustments (pac-3) that were partially offset by higher volume (pac-3). net sales for tactical and strike missile programs were comparable as higher volume (prsm) was offset by lower volume (air dominance weapon systems). mfc's operating profit in 2022 decreased $13 million, or 1%, compared to 2021. the decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of approximately $85 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to lower net favorable profit adjustments for the pac-3 program and an unfavorable profit adjustment of about $40 million on an air and missile defense development program. this decrease was partially offset by an increase of about $50 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to contract mix and higher net favorable profit adjustments (an international tactical and strike missile program and himars) that were partially offset by an unfavorable profit adjustment of about $25 million on an air-to-ground missile program. there also were unfavorable profit adjustments of approximately $25 million on an energy program in 2021 that did not recur in 2022. operating profit for sensors and global sustainment programs was comparable as both contract mix and the net effect of favorable profit adjustments on an international program in 2022 were offset by the closeout activities related to the warrior program in 2021 that did not recur in 2022. net favorable profit booking rate adjustments were $45 million lower in 2022 compared to 2021. backlog backlog increased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher orders on precision fires (gmlrs) and thaad programs. rotary and mission systems rms designs, manufactures, services and supports various military and commercial helicopters, surface ships, sea and land-based missile defense systems, radar systems, sea and air-based mission and combat systems, command and control mission solutions, cyber solutions, and simulation and training solutions. rms' major programs include aegis combat system, littoral combat ship (lcs), multi-mission surface combatant (mmsc), black hawk and seahawk helicopters, ch-53k king stallion heavy lift helicopter, combat rescue helicopter (crh), vh-92a helicopter, and the c2bmc program. on december 5, 2022, the u.s. army selected sikorsky's competitor in the future long range assault aircraft competition, a component of its future vertical lift initiative to replace a portion of its assault and utility helicopter fleet. on december 28, 2022, sikorsky, on behalf of team defiant, filed a protest challenging the u.s. army's decision, and a ruling is expected on or before april 7, 2023 based on the 100-day deadline. sikorsky remains one of two competitors for the other component of the future vertical lift initiative, the future attack reconnaissance aircraft competition. table of contents rms' operating results included the following (in millions): 2022 2021 2020 net sales $16,148 $16,789 $15,995 operating profit 1,673 1,798 1,615 operating margin 10.4 % 10.7 % 10.1 % backlog at year-end $34,949 $33,700 $36,249 rms' net sales in 2022 decreased $641 million, or 4%, compared to 2021. the decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of approximately $280 million for tls programs primarily due to the delivery of an international pilot training system in the first quarter of 2021 that did not recur in 2022; about $205 million for various c6isr programs due to lower volume; and approximately $170 million for sikorsky helicopter programs due to lower production volume (black hawk) that was partially offset by higher production volume (ch-53k). rms' operating profit in 2022 decreased $125 million, or 7%, compared to 2021. the decrease was primarily attributable to approximately $70 million for sikorsky helicopter programs due to lower production volume and net favorable profit adjustments (black hawk) that were partially offset by higher net favorable profit adjustments (crh); about $50 million for various c6isr programs due to lower net favorable profit adjustments; and approximately $15 million for integrated warfare systems and sensors (iwss) programs due to lower net favorable profit adjustments (tpq-53 and aegis) that were partially offset by $30 million of unfavorable profit adjustments on a ground-based radar program in 2021 that did not recur in 2022. these decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately $35 million for tls programs due to higher net favorable profit adjustments that were partially offset by lower volume due to the delivery of an international pilot training system in the first quarter of 2021 that did not recur in 2022. net favorable profit booking rate adjustments were $65 million lower in 2022 compared to 2021. backlog backlog increased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher orders on sikorsky programs. space our space business segment is engaged in the research and design, development, engineering and production of satellites, space transportation systems, and strategic, advanced strike and defensive systems. space provides network-enabled situational awareness and integrates complex space and ground global systems to help our customers gather, analyze, and securely distribute critical intelligence data. space is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. space's major programs include the trident ii d5 fleet ballistic missile (fbm), orion multi-purpose crew vehicle (orion), space based infrared system (sbirs) and next generation overhead persistent infrared (next gen opir) system, global positioning system (gps) iii, hypersonics programs and next generation interceptor (ngi). operating profit for our space business segment includes our share of earnings for our investment in ula, which provides expendable launch services to the u.s. government and commercial customers. space's operating results included the following (in millions): 2022 2021 2020 net sales $11,532 $11,814 $11,880 operating profit 1,045 1,134 1,149 operating margin 9.1 % 9.6 % 9.7 % backlog at year-end $29,684 $25,516 $25,148 space's net sales in 2022 decreased $282 million, or 2%, compared to 2021. the decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of approximately $885 million due to the renationalization of the awe program on june 30, 2021, which was no longer included in our financial results beginning in the third quarter of 2021; and about $125 million for commercial civil space programs due to lower volume (orion). these decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of about $495 million for strategic and missile defense programs due to higher development volume (ngi); and about $245 million for national security space programs due to higher development volume (classified programs). space's operating profit in 2022 decreased $89 million, or 8%, compared to 2021. the decrease was primarily attributable to approximately $85 million for national security space programs primarily due to lower net favorable profit adjustments (classified programs and sbirs) that were partially offset by lower net unfavorable profit adjustments of $25 million on a table of contents ground solutions program; and about $40 million for commercial civil space programs due to lower net favorable profit adjustments (human lander system (hls)) and lower volume (orion). these decreases were partially offset by higher equity earnings of approximately $35 million from the company's investment in ula due to higher launch volume and launch mix; and about $20 million for strategic and missile defense programs due to higher net favorable profit adjustments (primarily ngi). operating profit for the awe program was comparable as its operating profit in 2021 was mostly offset by accelerated amortization expense for intangible assets as a result of the renationalization. net favorable profit booking rate adjustments were $150 million lower in 2022 compared to 2021. equity earnings total equity earnings (primarily ula) represented approximately $100 million and $65 million, or 10% and 6%, of space's operating profit during 2022 and 2021. backlog backlog increased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to the exercise of the orion production contract option for artemis vi-viii in commercial civil space and contract awards in national security space (southern positioning augmentation network (southpan) and classified). liquidity and cash flows as of december 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.5 billion. our principal source of liquidity is our cash from operations. however, we also have access to credit markets, if needed, for liquidity or general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. this access includes our $3.0 billion revolving credit facility or the ability to issue commercial paper, and letters of credit to support customer advance payments and for other trade finance purposes such as guaranteeing our performance on particular contracts. we believe our cash and cash equivalents, our expected cash flow generated from operations and our access to credit markets will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements and cash deployment plans over the next twelve months and beyond based on our current business plans. cash received from customers, either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances from non-u.s. government customers in excess of costs incurred, is our primary source of cash from operations. we generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. however, from time to time, we fund customer programs ourselves pending government appropriations. if we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on the contract or in advance of a contract award, this negatively affects our cash flows and we may be at risk for reimbursement of the excess costs. billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. we generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost-reimbursable contracts, which represented approximately 38% of the sales we recorded in 2022, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred. a number of our fixed-price contracts may provide for performance-based payments, which allow us to bill and collect cash as we perform on the contract. the amount of performance-based payments and the related milestones are encompassed in the negotiation of each contract. the timing of such payments may differ from the timing of the costs incurred related to our contract performance, thereby affecting our cash flows. the u.s. government has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating payment terms on fixed-price contracts, rather than performance-based payments. in contrast to negotiated performance-based payment terms, progress payment provisions correspond to a percentage of the amount of costs incurred during the performance of the contract and are invoiced regularly as costs are incurred. our cash flows may be affected if the u.s. government changes its payment policies or decides to withhold payments on our billings. while the impact of policy changes or withholding payments may delay the receipt of cash, the cumulative amount of cash collected during the life of the contract should not vary. to date, the effects of covid-19 have resulted in some negative impacts on our cash flows, partially due to supplier disruptions and delays. the u.s. government has taken certain actions and enacted legislation to mitigate the impacts of covid-19 on public health, the economy, state and local governments, individuals, and businesses. since the pandemic began, lockheed martin has remained committed to accelerating payments to the supply chain with a focus on small and at risk businesses. as of december 31, 2022, we have accelerated $1.5 billion of payments to our suppliers that are due by their terms in future periods. we will continue to monitor supply chain risks, especially at small and at-risk related suppliers, and may continue to utilize accelerated payments in 2023 on an as needed basis. in addition, we have a balanced cash deployment strategy to invest in our business and key technologies to provide our customers with enhanced capabilities, enhance stockholder value, and position ourselves to take advantage of new business table of contents opportunities when they arise. consistent with that strategy, we have continued to invest in our business and technologies through capital expenditures, independent research and development, and selective business acquisitions and investments. we have returned cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. on october 17, 2022, the board of directors authorized an additional $14.0 billion to the program. during the fourth quarter of 2022, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (asr) agreement to repurchase $4.0 billion of our common stock and issued $4.0 billion of senior unsecured notes. as of december 31, 2022, the total remaining authorization for future common share repurchases under our program was $10.0 billion, which is expected to be utilized over a three-year period. we expect to fund the repurchases through a combination of cash from operations and the issuance of additional debt. the stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be amended or terminated by the board of directors at any time. the amount of shares ultimately purchased and the timing of purchases are at the discretion of management and subject to compliance with applicable law and regulation. we continue to actively manage our debt levels, including maturities and interest rates, as evidenced by the debt transaction in the second quarter of 2022, the proceeds of which were used to refinance certain upcoming debt maturities between 2023 and 2026. we also actively manage our pension obligations and expect to continue to opportunistically manage our pension liabilities through the purchase of group annuity contracts for portions of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations using assets from the pension trust as we did in the second quarter of 2022. see \"note 11 - postretirement benefit plans\" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information. future pension risk transfer transactions could also be significant and result in us making additional contributions to the pension trust. the following table provides a summary of our cash flow information followed by a discussion of the key elements (in millions): 2022 2021 2020 cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year $3,604 $3,160 $1,514 operating activities net earnings 5,732 6,315 6,833 noncash adjustments

(2,010) net cash used for financing activities (7,070) (7,616) (4,527) net change in cash and cash equivalents (1,057) 444 1,646 cash and cash equivalents at end of year $2,547 $3,604 $3,160 operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased $1.4 billion in 2022 compared to 2021. the decrease was primarily attributable to lower cash at aeronautics, mfc and rms. the decrease at aeronautics was primarily due to timing of production and billing cycles impacting contract assets (primarily f-35). the decrease at mfc was primarily due to timing of accounts receivables collections. the decrease at rms was primarily due to liquidation of inventories (primarily tls and sikorsky helicopter programs) in 2021 that did not recur in 2022. as of december 31, 2022, we accelerated $1.5 billion of payments to suppliers that were due in the first quarter of 2023, compared to $2.2 billion of payments to suppliers as of december 31, 2021 that were due in the first quarter of 2022. our federal and foreign income tax payments, net of refunds, were $1.6 billion in 2022, compared to $1.4 billion in 2021. non-gaap financial measure - free cash flow free cash flow is a non-gaap financial measure that we define as cash from operations less capital expenditures. our capital expenditures are comprised of equipment and facilities infrastructure and information technology (inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software that are capitalized). we use free cash flow to evaluate our business performance and overall liquidity, as well as a performance goal in our annual and long-term incentive plans. we believe free cash flow is a useful measure for investors because it represents the amount of cash generated from operations after reinvesting in the business and that may be available to return to stockholders and creditors (through dividends, stock repurchases and debt repayments) or available to fund acquisitions and other investments. the entire amount of free cash flow is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures, however, because it does not account for certain mandatory expenditures, such as the table of contents repayment of maturing debt and pension contributions. while management believes that free cash flow as a non-gaap financial measure may be useful in evaluating our financial performance, it should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. the following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions): 2022 2021 2020 cash from operations $7,802 $9,221 $8,183 capital expenditures (1,670) (1,522) (1,766) free cash flow $6,132 $7,699 $6,417 investing activities cash flows related to investing activities primarily include capital expenditures and payments for acquisitions and divestitures of businesses and investments. the majority of our capital expenditures are for equipment and facilities infrastructure that generally are incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. we also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software. net cash used for investing activities increased $628 million in 2022 compared to 2021. the increase in cash used for investing activities is due to an increase in capital expenditures and the receipt of $307 million in 2021 from the sale of our ownership interest in the advanced military maintenance, repair and overhaul center (ammroc) joint venture. capital expenditures totaled $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion in 2022 and 2021. financing activities net cash used for financing activities decreased $546 million in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to repayment of $500 million of long-term notes in 2021. we paid dividends totaling $3.0 billion ($11.40 per share) in 2022 and $2.9 billion ($10.60 per share) in 2021. we paid quarterly dividends of $2.80 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2022 and $3.00 per share during the fourth quarter of 2022. we paid quarterly dividends of $2.60 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2021 and $2.80 per share during the fourth quarter of 2021. during 2022, we paid $7.9 billion to repurchase 18.3 million shares of our common stock. see \"note 12 - stockholders' equity\" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information. during 2021, we paid $4.1 billion to repurchase 11.7 million shares of our common stock. in october 2022, we received net proceeds of $3.9 billion from issuance of senior unsecured notes and used the net proceeds from the offering to enter into an asr agreement to repurchase $4.0 billion of our common stock. see \"note 10 - debt\" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information. in may 2022, we received net proceeds of $2.3 billion from issuance of senior unsecured notes and used the net proceeds from the offering to redeem all of the outstanding $500 million notes due 2023, $750 million notes due 2025 and used the remaining balance of the net proceeds to redeem $1.0 billion of our outstanding $2.0 billion notes due 2026. in september 2021, we repaid $500 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 3.35% according to their scheduled maturities. capital structure, resources and other at december 31, 2022, we held cash and cash equivalents of $2.5 billion that were generally available to fund ordinary business operations without significant legal, regulatory, or other restrictions. our outstanding debt, net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs, was $15.5 billion as of december 31, 2022 and is in the form of publicly-issued notes that bear interest at fixed rates. as of december 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit agreements. see \"note 10 - debt\" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on our long-term debt and revolving credit facilities. table of contents we actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. we review changes in financial market and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts and maturities of our indebtedness. we may at times refinance existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs. long-term debt on october 24, 2022, we issued a total of $4.0 billion of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.95% notes due 2025 (the \"2025 notes\"), $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.10% notes due 2027 (the \"2027 notes\"), $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.25% notes due 2033 (the \"2033 notes\"), $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.70% notes due 2054 (the \"2054 notes\") and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.90% notes due 2063 (the \"2063 notes\" and, together with the 2025 notes, the 2027 notes, the 2033 notes and the 2054 notes, the \"october 2022 notes\"). we will pay interest on the 2025 notes semi-annually in arrears on april 15 and october 15 of each year, beginning on april 15, 2023. we will pay interest on the 2033 notes semi-annually in arrears on january 15 and july 15 of each year, beginning on january 15, 2023. we will pay interest on each of 2027 notes, 2054 notes and 2063 notes semi-annually in arrears on may 15 and november 15 of each year, beginning on may 15, 2023. we may, at our option, redeem the october 2022 notes of any series, in whole or in part, at any time at the redemption prices equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or an applicable \"make-whole\" amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. on may 5, 2022, we issued a total of $2.3 billion of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $800 million aggregate principal amount of 3.90% notes due june 15, 2032 (the \"2032 notes\"), $850 million aggregate principal amount of 4.15% notes due june 15, 2053 (the \"2053 notes\") and $650 million aggregate principal amount of 4.30% notes due june 15, 2062 (the \"2062 notes\" and, together with the 2032 notes and 2053 notes, the \"may 2022 notes\") in a registered public offering. net proceeds received from the offering were, after deducting pricing discounts and debt issuance costs, which are being amortized and recorded as interest expense over the term of the may 2022 notes. we will pay interest on the may 2022 notes semi-annually in arrears on june 15 and december 15 of each year with the first payment made on june 15, 2022. we may, at our option, redeem the may 2022 notes of any series, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the may 2022 notes to be redeemed or an applicable make-whole amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. on may 11, 2022, we used the net proceeds from the may 2022 notes to redeem all of the outstanding $500 million in aggregate principal amount of our 3.10% notes due 2023, $750 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2.90% notes due 2025, and $1.0 billion of our outstanding $2.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 3.55% notes due 2026 at their redemption price. we paid make-whole premiums of $13.9 million in connection with the early extinguishments of debt. we incurred losses of $34 million ($26 million, or $0.10 per share, after tax) on these transactions related to early extinguishments of debt, additional interest expense and other related charges, which was recorded in other non-operating (expense) income, net in our consolidated statements of earnings. table of contents contractual commitments at december 31, 2022, we had contractual commitments to repay debt, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services and settle tax and other liabilities. financing lease obligations were not material. payments due under these obligations and commitments are as follows (in millions): total due within 1 year total debt $16,842 $118 interest payments 15,028 768 other liabilities 3,520 222 operating lease obligations 1,342 327 purchase obligations: operating activities 59,101 27,925 capital expenditures 671 472 total contractual cash obligations $96,504 $29,832 the table above includes debt presented gross of any unamortized discounts and issuance costs, but excludes the net unfunded obligation and estimated minimum funding requirements related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. for additional information about obligations and our future minimum contribution requirements for these plans, see \"note 11 - postretirement benefit plans\" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements. amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of december 31, 2022. such amounts mainly include expected payments under non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities and deferred compensation plans. purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to subcontractors and outsourcing arrangements. total purchase obligations for operating activities in the preceding table include approximately $53.7 billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our u.s. government customers. the u.s. government generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts \"for convenience\" under the far, subject to available funding. this also would be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a u.s. government contract. the termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with foreign, state and local governments. we also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers. the majority of our capital expenditures for 2022 and those planned for 2023 are for equipment, facilities infrastructure and information technology. the amounts above in the table represent the portion of expected capital expenditures to be incurred in 2023 and beyond that have been obligated under contracts as of december 31, 2022 and not necessarily total capital expenditures for future periods. expenditures for equipment and facilities infrastructure are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. for example, we have projects underway at aeronautics to support classified development programs and at rms to support our sikorsky helicopter programs; and we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities. we also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software. we also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. these agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. these agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, establishment of joint ventures with local companies and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. we typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. the amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement. satisfaction of our offset obligations are included in the estimates of our total costs to complete the contract and may impact our sales, profitability and cash flows. our ability to recover investments on our consolidated balance sheet that we make to satisfy offset obligations is generally dependent upon the successful operation of table of contents ventures that we do not control and may involve products and services that are dissimilar to our business activities. at december 31, 2022, the notional value of remaining obligations under our outstanding offset agreements totaled approximately $16.1 billion, which primarily relate to our aeronautics, mfc and rms business segments, most of which extend through 2044. to the extent we have entered into purchase or other obligations at december 31, 2022 that also satisfy offset agreements, those amounts are included in the contractual commitments table above. offset programs usually extend over several years and may provide for penalties, estimated at approximately $1.8 billion at december 31, 2022, in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. while historically we have not been required to pay material penalties, resolution of offset requirements are often the result of negotiations and subjective judgments. we have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds issued on our behalf by financial institutions, and we have directly issued guarantees to third parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. letters of credit and surety bonds generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform. in some cases, we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as joint venture partners. at december 31, 2022, we had the following outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and third-party guarantees (in millions): total less than commitment 1 year standby letters of credit (a) $2,504 $966 surety bonds 342 342 third-party guarantees 904 230 total commitments $3,750 $1,538 (a)approximately $704 million of standby letters of credit in the \"less than 1 year\" category are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation. at december 31, 2022, third-party guarantees totaled $904 million, of which approximately 71% related to guarantees of contractual performance of joint ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. these amounts represent our estimate of the maximum amounts we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of the joint venture, joint venture partners or divested businesses. generally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner. in determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements, all of which include a guarantee as required by the far. at december 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements. critical accounting policies contract accounting / sales recognition the majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the u.s. government and international customers (including fms contracted through the u.s. government) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. we account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. for certain contracts that meet the foregoing requirements, primarily international direct commercial sale contracts, we are required to obtain certain regulatory approvals. in these cases, we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. we provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts. under fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. to the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance. cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer's assessment of our performance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e., table of contents incentive based on performance). cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts provide a fixed fee that is negotiated at the inception of the contract and does not vary with actual costs. we assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. when making this determination, we consider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same time or were negotiated with an overall profit objective. if combined, we treat the combined contracts as a single contract for revenue recognition purposes. we evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one or more performance obligations. the products and services in our contracts are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationships and the significant contract management functions required to perform under the contract. accordingly, our contracts are typically accounted for as one performance obligation. in limited cases, our contracts have more than one distinct performance obligation, which occurs when we perform activities that are not highly complex or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles. significant judgment is required in determining performance obligations, and these decisions could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. we classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the performance obligations. we determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under the contract. for contracts where a portion of the price may vary (e.g. awards, incentive fees and claims), we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount, which is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. we analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk. at the inception of a contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current rights and do not contemplate future modifications (including unexercised options) or follow-on contracts until they become legally enforceable. contracts are often subsequently modified to include changes in specifications, requirements or price, which may create new or change existing enforceable rights and obligations. depending on the nature of the modification, we consider whether to account for the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. generally, modifications to our contracts are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated tasks provided in the context of the contract. therefore, such modifications are accounted for as if they were part of the existing contract and recognized as a cumulative adjustment to revenue. for contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation. the standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not bundled with any other products or services). our contracts with the u.s. government, including fms contracts, are subject to far and the price is typically based on estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. as a result of these regulations, the standalone selling price of products or services in our contracts with the u.s. government and fms contracts are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract. for non-u.s. government contracts with multiple performance obligations, we evaluate whether the stated selling prices for the products or services represent their standalone selling prices. we primarily sell customized solutions unique to a customer's specifications. when it is necessary to allocate the transaction price to multiple performance obligations, we typically use the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling price of each product or service. we occasionally sell standard products or services with observable standalone sales transactions. in these situations, the observable standalone sales transactions are used to determine the standalone selling price. we recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. in determining when performance obligations are satisfied, we consider factors such as contract terms, payment terms and whether there is an alternative future use of the product or service. substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. for most contracts with the u.s. government and fms contracts, this continuous transfer of control of the work in process to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that give the customer ownership of work in process and allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience and pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit. for most non-u.s. government contracts, primarily international direct commercial contracts, continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported because we deliver products that do not have an alternative use to us and if our customer were to terminate the contract for reasons other than our non-performance we would have the right to recover damages which would include, among other potential damages, the right to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit. table of contents for performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation(s). for performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs incurred or the right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the benefits. for performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied. this coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point. significant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales, costs, and profit. we estimate profit as the difference between estimated revenues and total estimated costs to complete the contract. at the outset of a long-term contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, as well as our ability to earn variable consideration, and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of sales and total costs to complete the contract. the estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead, general and administrative and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset or localization agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks related to technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract or may increase the variable consideration we expect to receive on the contract. conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase or our estimates of variable consideration we expect to receive decrease. all of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is evident, which we refer to as a reach-forward loss. comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards completion. increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as favorable profit adjustments, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate and are typically referred to as unfavorable profit adjustments. increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period they are determined and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; covid-19 impacts or supply chain disruptions; restructuring charges (except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results); reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets. other contract accounting considerations the majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the u.s. government. cost-based pricing is determined under the far. the far provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under u.s. government contracts. for example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, interest expense and certain advertising and public relations activities are unallowable and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. in addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the u.s. government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. for example, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under far provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the u.s. government. table of contents we closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. costs incurred and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with u.s. government regulations by our personnel and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency. postretirement benefit plans overview many of our employees and retirees participate in qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans and other postemployment plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans - see \"note 11 - postretirement benefit plans\" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements). the majority of our accrued benefit obligations relate to our qualified defined benefit pension and retiree medical and life insurance plans. we recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plans under gaap as either an asset or a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. the gaap funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan's assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. the gaap benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefits we currently expect to pay to plan participants based on past service. the qualified defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees are fully frozen effective january 1, 2020 and our salaried employees participate in an enhanced defined contribution retirement savings plan. similar to recent years, we continue to take actions to mitigate the effect of our defined benefit pension plans on our financial results by reducing the volatility of our pension obligations, including entering into pension risk transfer transactions involving the purchase of group annuity contracts (gacs) for portions of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations using assets from the pension trust. during the second quarter of 2022, we purchased gacs to transfer $4.3 billion of gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company for approximately 13,600 u.s. retirees and beneficiaries. the gacs were purchased using assets from lockheed martin's master retirement trust and no additional funding contribution was required. in connection with this transaction, we recognized a noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $1.5 billion ($1.2 billion, or $4.33 per share, after-tax) for the affected defined benefit pension plans in the quarter ended june 26, 2022, which represents the accelerated recognition of actuarial losses that were included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss account within stockholders' equity. similarly, in the third quarter of 2021, we purchased gacs to transfer $4.9 billion of gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company for approximately 18,000 u.s. retirees and beneficiaries. in connection with this transaction, we recognized a noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after tax) during the third quarter of 2021. inclusive of the transactions described above, since december 2018, lockheed martin, through its master retirement trust, has purchased total contracts for approximately $15.9 billion related to our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations eliminating pension plan volatility for approximately 109,000 retirees and beneficiaries and annually required pension benefit guarantee corporation (pbgc) premiums of approximately $79 million per year. we expect to continue to look for opportunities to manage our pension liabilities through additional pension risk transfer transactions in future years. future transactions could result in a noncash settlement charge to earnings, which could be material to a reporting period. notwithstanding these actions, the impact of our postretirement benefit plans on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and the funded status for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because the calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, actual rates of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity, as well as the timing of cash funding. actuarial assumptions the benefit obligations and assets of our postretirement benefit plans are measured at the end of each year, or more frequently, upon the occurrence of certain events such as a significant plan amendment (including in connection with a pension risk transfer transaction), settlement, or curtailment. the amounts we record are measured using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key assumptions such as discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and participant longevity. the assumptions we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligations as of the measurement date and the calculation of fas expense in subsequent periods. when reassessing these assumptions, we consider past and current market conditions and make judgments about future market trends. we also consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants. we continue to use a single weighted average discount rate approach when calculating our consolidated benefit obligations related to our defined benefit pension plans resulting in 5.250% at december 31, 2022, compared to 2.875% at december 31, table of contents 2021. we utilized a single weighted average discount rate of 5.25% when calculating our benefit obligations related to our retiree medical and life insurance plans at december 31, 2022, compared to 2.75% at december 31, 2021. we evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate single weighted average discount rate, including results from cash flow models, quoted rates from long-term bond indices and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year. as part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on corporate bonds rated aa or better selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flows. the increase in the discount rate from december 31, 2021 to december 31, 2022 resulted in a decrease in the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit pension plans of approximately $10.2 billion at december 31, 2022. we utilized an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.50% at both december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021. the long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected long-term rate of return on the funds invested or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the benefit obligations. this assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns. the difference between the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of fas pension expense in subsequent periods. although the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, the average expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption. any variance each year should not, by itself, suggest that the assumption should be changed. patterns of variances are reviewed over time, and then combined with expectations for the future. as a result, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate. the actual investment return for our qualified defined benefit plans during 2022 of $(5.9) billion, based on an actual rate of approximately (18)%, reduced plan assets more than the $1.9 billion expected return based on our long-term rate of return assumption. our stockholders' equity has been reduced cumulatively by $7.9 billion from the annual year-end measurements of the funded status of postretirement benefit plans. the cumulative noncash, after-tax reduction primarily represents net actuarial losses resulting from changes in discount rates, investment experience, and updated longevity. a market-related value of our plan assets, determined using actual asset gains or losses over the prior three-year period, is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. these cumulative actuarial losses will be amortized to expense using the corridor method, where gains and losses are recognized to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of plan assets or benefit obligations, over an average period of approximately twenty years as of december 31, 2022. during 2022, $1.2 billion of these amounts, along with amortization of net prior service credit, were recognized as a component of postretirement benefit plans expense inclusive of the noncash pension settlement charge of $1.2 billion. the discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions we select at the end of each year are based on our best estimates and judgment. a change of plus or minus 25 basis points in the 5.25% discount rate assumption at december 31, 2022, with all other assumptions held constant, would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of 2022 by approximately $800 million, which would result in an after-tax increase or decrease in stockholders' equity at the end of the year of approximately $600 million. if the 5.25% discount rate at december 31, 2022 that was used to compute the expected 2023 fas pension income for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of fas pension income projected for 2023 would change approximately $5 million. if the 6.50% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption at december 31, 2022 that was used to compute the expected 2023 fas pension income for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of fas pension income projected for 2023 would be higher or lower by approximately $65 million. each year, differences between the actual and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets impacts the measurement of the following year's fas pension income. every 100 basis points increase (decrease) in return during 2022 between our actual rate of return of approximately (18)% and our expected long-term rate of return increased (decreased) 2023 expected fas pension income by approximately $10 million. funding considerations we made no contributions in 2022 and 2021 to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in a manner consistent with cas and in accordance with the employee retirement income security act of 1974 (erisa), as amended, along with consideration of cas and internal revenue code rules. our goal has been to fund the pension plans to a level of at least 80%, as determined in accordance with erisa. the erisa funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans was approximately 82% and 92% as of december 31, 2022 and 2021; which is calculated on a different basis than under gaap and reflects the impact of the american rescue plan act of 2021. contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on u.s. government contracts, including fms, and are recognized in our cost of sales and net sales. cas govern the extent to table of contents which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the u.s. government, including fms. pension cost recoveries under cas occur in different periods from when pension contributions are made in accordance with erisa. we recovered $1.8 billion in 2022 and $2.1 billion in 2021 as cas pension costs. amounts contributed in excess of the cas pension costs recovered under u.s. government contracts are considered to be prepayment credits under the cas rules. our prepayment credits were approximately $4.3 billion and $7.0 billion at december 31, 2022 and 2021. the prepayment credit balance will increase or decrease based on our actual investment return on plan assets. environmental matters we are a party to various agreements, proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental remediation issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (prp). at december 31, 2022 and 2021, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet for environmental matters was $696 million and $742 million. we have recorded assets totaling $618 million and $645 million at december 31, 2022 and 2021 for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for agencies of the u.s. government, as discussed below. the amount that is expected to be allocated to our non-u.s. government contracts or that is determined to not be recoverable under u.s. government contracts is expensed through cost of sales. we project costs and recovery of costs over approximately 20 years. we enter into agreements (e.g., administrative consent orders, consent decrees) that document the extent and timing of some of our environmental remediation obligations. we also are involved in environmental remediation activities at sites where formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligations. environmental remediation activities usually span many years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to, for example, changing remediation technologies. to determine the costs related to clean up sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, effects on natural resources, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation, and evolving environmental standards. we perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and receivables in the period it becomes probable that the liabilities have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under \"environmental matters\" in \"note 1 - organization and significant accounting policies\" and \"note 14 - legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies\" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements). we consider the above factors in our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for environmental remediation activities, which result in the calculation of a range of estimates for each particular environmental remediation site. we do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. given the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g., a change in environmental standards or a change in our estimate of the extent of contamination). under agreements reached with the u.s. government, most of the amounts we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs. under existing u.s. government regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our u.s. government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other prps, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. as a result, most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to u.s. government agreement or regulation, regardless of the contract form (e.g. cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). we continually evaluate the recoverability of our assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery by assessing, among other factors, u.s. government regulations, our u.s. government business base and contract mix, our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs, and efforts by some u.s. government representatives to limit such reimbursement. as disclosed above, we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites, which would result in a change to the corresponding amount that is probable of future recovery and a charge to earnings. for example, if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by $100 million, the corresponding amount that is probable of future recovery would be increased by approximately $89 million, with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings. this allocation is determined annually, based upon our existing and projected business activities with the u.s. government. we cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental remediation sites with which we are involved. there are a number of former operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future environmental remediation. in some cases, although a loss may be probable, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties (e.g., assessing the extent of the contamination). during any particular quarter, such uncertainties may be resolved, allowing us to estimate and recognize the initial liability to table of contents remediate a particular former operating site. the amount of the liability could be material. upon recognition of the liability, a portion will be recognized as a receivable with the remainder charged to earnings, which may have a material effect in any particular interim reporting period. if we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a prp, we expect that the actual costs of environmental remediation will be shared with other liable prps. generally, prps that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site remediation and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for environmental investigation and remediation. under existing environmental laws, responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. in the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of cost recovery or contribution from the other prps. the amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other prps, which we are required to pursue by agreement and u.s. government regulation. goodwill and intangible assets the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. intangible assets from acquired businesses are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date and consist of customer programs, trademarks, customer relationships, technology and other intangible assets. customer programs include values assigned to major programs of acquired businesses and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationships, contracts, technology and trademarks underlying the associated program. intangible assets are amortized over a period of expected cash flows used to measure fair value, which typically ranges from five to 20 years. our goodwill balance was $10.8 billion at both december 31, 2022 and 2021. we perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. such events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, competition, reorganizations of our business, u.s. government budget restrictions or the disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit. our goodwill has been allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit, which is our business segment level or a level below the business segment. the level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine whether the operations below the business segment constitute a self-sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results. we may use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. for selected reporting units where we use the qualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment. based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. otherwise, we perform a quantitative impairment test. we perform quantitative tests for most reporting units at least once every three years. however, for certain reporting units we may perform a quantitative impairment test every year. to perform the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. if the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. we generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (dcf) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in recent business acquisitions. determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant transaction multiples. the cash flows employed in the dcf analysis are based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions, u.s. government budgets, existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. the discount rates utilized in the dcf analysis are based on the respective reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. the carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations, goodwill and allocations of amounts held at the business segment and corporate levels. in the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units. the results of that test indicated that for each of our reporting units no impairment existed, including sikorsky. based on this, the fair value table of contents of our sikorsky reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, which included goodwill of $2.7 billion, by a margin of approximately 40%. the fair value of both our sikorsky reporting unit and the indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset can be significantly impacted by its performance, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, contract terminations, changes in expected future orders, general market pressures, including u.s. government budgetary constraints, discount rates, long term growth rates, and changes in u.s. (federal or state) or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including those with retroactive effect, along with other significant judgments. based on our assessment of these circumstances, we have determined that goodwill at our sikorsky reporting unit and the indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset at our sikorsky reporting unit are at risk for impairment should there be a significant deterioration of projected cash flows of the reporting unit. we do not currently anticipate any material impairments on our assets as a result of covid-19 or inflation. impairment assessments inherently involve management judgments regarding a number of assumptions such as those described above. due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit's fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. acquired intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing or more frequently if events or change in circumstance indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. this testing compares carrying value to fair value and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. in the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed our annual impairment test, and the results of that test indicated no impairment existed. intangibles are amortized to expense over their applicable useful lives, ranging from five to 20 years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit as reflected by future net cash inflows. we perform an impairment test of finite-lived intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired. if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a finite-lived intangible may be impaired, the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group would be compared to the asset group's carrying value. if the asset group's carrying amount exceed the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, we would determine the fair value of the asset group and record an impairment loss in net earnings.\"\"\"\n\n    Instruction:\n    Identify and summarize all sentences or phrases that are directly or indirectly related to \"organizational resilience\", including but not limited to: scholars have defined organizational resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” (vogus & sutcliffe, 2007: 3418).

organizational resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” (vogus & sutcliffe, 2007: 3418). organizational resilience is defined as the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity. resilience can be defined as the system’s ability to maintain its integrity and its performance, at least partially, while under internal or external variations and disturbances (i.e. pressures, constraints, failures, errors, violations, hazards), whether nominal, extreme, or exceptional. defined as a company’s ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from a challenging situation. we develop a trajectory model of organizational resilience that focuses on how actors project temporal trajectories of responses toward disruptive events, reconstitute the trajectories in immediate response to the event, and reconfigure the trajectories toward the ensuing future. the concept of resilience draws attention to systems as well as individuals, to partial maintenance of integrity and performance, to the opposite of brittleness, and to disturbances that vary both in scale and source. resilience is a multifaceted concept that reflects businesses’ ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change to survive, grow, and flourish.\"\"\"\n\n    Text:\n    \"\"\"item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources during the two-year period ended february 3, 2023 (our fiscal years 2022 and 2021). unless otherwise noted, all references herein for the years 2022, 2021, and 2020 represent the fiscal years ended february 3, 2023, january 28, 2022, and january 29, 2021, respectively. fiscal year 2022 contains 53 weeks of operating results compared to fiscal years 2021 and 2020, which contain 52 weeks. we intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles affect our financial statements. this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. this discussion and analysis is presented in four sections: •executive overview •operations •financial condition, liquidity and capital resources •critical accounting policies and estimates executive overview net sales for fiscal 2022 increased 0.8% over fiscal 2021 to $97.1 billion. the increase in total sales was primarily driven by the 53rd week, partially offset by a decrease in comparable sales. the 53rd week contributed approximately 1.4% to the sales growth for 2022. comparable sales decreased 0.9% over fiscal 2021, driven by a 7.6% decrease in comparable customer transactions, partially offset by a 6.7% increase in comparable average ticket. net earnings for fiscal 2022 decreased 23.8% to $6.4 billion. diluted earnings per common share decreased 15.5% in fiscal 2022 to $10.17 from $12.04 in fiscal 2021. included in the fiscal 2022 results is $2.5 billion of pre-tax costs associated with the sale of the canadian retail business consisting of long-lived asset impairment, loss on sale, and additional closing costs, which decreased diluted earnings per share by $3.64. adjusting for these items, adjusted diluted earnings per common share increased 14.7% to $13.81 in 2022 from diluted earnings per common share of $12.04 in 2021 (see the non-gaap financial measures discussion). for fiscal 2022, cash flows from operating activities were $8.6 billion, with $1.8 billion used for capital expenditures. continuing to deliver on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, the company repurchased $14.1 billion of common stock and paid $2.4 billion in dividends during the year. the total home strategy remained our focus for the year, which reflects our commitment to provide a full complement of products and services for pro and diy consumers alike, enabling a total home solution for every project across the home. during the year, our continued investment in the pro customer helped generate broad-based demand with positive comparable sales in our core pro categories. in the first quarter, we launched our pro loyalty program, mvps pro rewards and partnership programtm, which is centered on creating a partnership with our pro customers. in addition, throughout the year, we improved pro product and service offerings, and enhanced product assortments to meet pro needs. demand with our diy customer was strong in core, home-improvement categories throughout the year, while discretionary diy category performance lagged due to a short spring season, cycling unprecedented demand over the past two years, and a reduction of holiday purchases. our perpetual productivity improvement (ppi) initiatives continued to gain efficiencies through our enhanced labor management tools, store inventory management system, and improved pricing capabilities. also, to date, we have converted 11 geographic areas to our market-based delivery model for big and bulky product. in this model, product flows directly to customer homes from our distribution network, bypassing stores altogether. we expect these initiatives and our investments in the business to deliver operating margin productivity and drive meaningful long-term shareholder value going forward. while improving our operating discipline, we have continued to invest in our front-line associates. in addition to the discretionary and profit-sharing bonuses awarded throughout the year, we implemented $170 million in annual wage increases effective december 2022. these compensation investments reflect our commitment to becoming the employer of choice in retail. with the sale of our canadian retail business on february 3, 2023, we are focused on the transformation of our u.s. home improvement business to further enhance our operating margin, simplify our business model, and deliver sustainable value to our shareholders. we believe the core demand drivers of our business are disposable personal income, home price appreciation, and the age of the housing stock. the typical homeowner today has significant equity in his or her home, while the housing stock continues to age. these factors, along with strong millennial household formation, elderly preference to age in place, and widespread remote work, continue to support the home improvement market, and we believe we are well-positioned to gain market share through our total home strategy. operations the following tables set forth the percentage relationship to net sales of each line item of the consolidated statements of earnings, as well as the percentage change in dollar amounts from the prior year. this table should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis and the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes to the consolidated financial statements. basis point increase / (decrease) in

utilized by management in assessing business performance. this table should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis and the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes to the consolidated financial statements. during fiscal 2022, the company adjusted its comparable sales metric to exclude days affected by national outages with its third-party credit and debit processor. excluding these days, and the corresponding prior period days, increased comparable sales by approximately 5 basis points for fiscal 2022. the comparable sales metric for fiscal 2021 and 2020 were not impacted or adjusted by similar outages. 23 other metrics 2022 2021 2020 comparable sales (decrease)/increase (0.9) % 6.9 % 26.1 % total customer transactions (in millions) 937

has been open longer than 13 months. a location that is identified for relocation is no longer considered comparable in the month of its relocation. the relocated location must then remain open longer than 13 months to be considered comparable. a location we have decided to close is no longer considered comparable as of the beginning of the month in which we announce its closing. operating locations which are sold are included in comparable sales until the date of sale. comparable sales include online sales, which positively impacted the comparable sales increase in fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020 by approximately 45 basis points, 150 basis points, and 565 basis points, respectively. the comparable sales calculation for 2022 included in the preceding table was calculated using sales for a comparable 53-week period. 3 average ticket is defined as net sales divided by the total number of customer transactions. 4 average store size selling square feet is defined as sales floor square feet divided by the number of stores open at the end of the period. the average lowe's-branded home improvement store has approximately 112,000 square feet of retail selling space. 5 return on average assets is defined as net earnings divided by average total assets for the last five quarters. 6 return on invested capital is calculated using a non-gaap financial measure. net earnings to average debt and shareholders' (deficit)/equity is the most comparable gaap ratio. as of february 3, 2023, roic was negatively impacted approximately 800 basis points as a result of the sale of the canadian retail business. see below for additional information and reconciliations of non-gaap measures. non-gaap financial measures adjusted diluted earnings per share adjusted diluted earnings per share is considered a non-gaap financial measure. the company believes this non-gaap financial measure provides useful insight for analysts and investors in evaluating what management considers the company's core operating performance. adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the impact of a discrete item, further described below, not contemplated in the company's business outlook for fiscal 2022. there were no non-gaap adjustments in fiscal 2021. fiscal 2022 impacts •in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the company recognized a pre-tax $2.1 billion long-lived asset impairment of the canadian retail business. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the company recognized additional pre-tax costs totaling $441 million, consisting of the loss on the sale and other closing costs associated with the sale of the canadian retail business (canadian retail business transaction costs). adjusted diluted earnings per share should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful indicator of, the company's diluted earnings per common share as prepared in accordance with gaap. the company's methods of determining this non-gaap financial measure may differ from the method used by other companies and may not be comparable. 2022 pre-tax earnings tax1 net earnings diluted earnings per share, as reported $10.17 non-gaap adjustments - per share impacts canadian

adjusted diluted earnings per share. 24 return on invested capital return on invested capital (roic) is calculated using a non-gaap financial measure. management believes roic is a meaningful metric for analysts and investors as a measure of how effectively the company is using capital to generate financial returns. although roic is a common financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating roic. accordingly, the method used by our management may differ from the methods used by other companies. we encourage you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate roic before comparing its roic to ours. we define roic as the rolling 12 months' lease adjusted net operating profit after tax (lease adjusted nopat) divided by the average of current year and prior year ending debt and shareholders' (deficit)/equity. lease adjusted nopat is a non-gaap financial measure, and net earnings is considered to be the most comparable gaap financial measure. the calculation of roic, together with a reconciliation of net earnings to lease adjusted nopat, is as follows: (in millions, except percentage data) 2022 2021 2020 calculation of return on invested

shareholders' (deficit)/equity is defined as average current year and prior year ending debt, including current maturities, short-term borrowings, and operating lease liabilities, plus the average current year and prior year ending total shareholders' (deficit)/equity. 3 as of february 3, 2023, roic was negatively impacted approximately 800 basis points as a result of the sale of the canadian retail business. fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 for the purpose of the following discussion, comparable store sales, comparable average ticket, and comparable customer transactions are based upon comparable 53-week periods. net sales - net sales increased 0.8% to $97.1 billion in 2022. the increase in total sales was driven by the 53rd week, partially offset by a decrease in comparable sales. the 53rd week contributed approximately 1.4% to the sales growth for 2022. comparable sales decreased 0.9% over the same period, driven by a 7.6% decline in comparable customer transactions, partially offset by a 6.7% increase in comparable average ticket. comparable sales change during each quarter of the fiscal year, as reported, were a decline of 4.0% in the first quarter, decline of 0.3% in the second quarter, increase of 2.2% in the third quarter, and decline of 1.5% in the fourth quarter. during 2022, we experienced comparable sales increases in six of 14 product categories, led by rough plumbing, building materials, and paint. strength in these categories reflects robust demand from pro customers, as well as unit price increases 25 driven by inflation. we experienced our lowest comparable sales in seasonal & outdoor living, tools, and lawn & garden. geographically, three of 15 u.s. regions experienced positive comparable sales with strength primarily in the south, while our canadian operations lagged the u.s. gross margin - gross margin as a percentage of sales for 2022 contracted 7 basis points compared to 2021. gross margin was negatively impacted by 30 basis points from higher transportation costs and expansion of our supply chain network and 20 basis points from inventory shrink. these were partially offset by approximately 25 basis points of favorable product mix and 20 basis points of total rate improvement driven by continued improvement in managing product costs and disciplined pricing strategies. sg&a - sg&a expense for 2022 deleveraged 193 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to 2021. this was primarily driven by the long-lived asset impairment, loss on sale, and other closing costs associated with the sale of the canadian retail business, partially offset by ongoing productivity initiatives. depreciation and amortization - depreciation and amortization expense deleveraged 9 basis points for 2022 as a percentage of sales compared to 2021, driven by ongoing capital investments in core business investments. property, less accumulated depreciation, decreased to $17.6 billion at february 3, 2023, compared to $19.1 billion at january 28, 2022, primarily due to the impairment of the canadian retail business long-lived assets in the third quarter of 2022. interest - net - net interest expense is comprised of the following: (in millions) 2022 2021 interest expense, net of amount capitalized $1,137 $869 amortization of original issue discount and loan costs 20 16 interest on tax uncertainties 3 12 interest income (37) (12) interest - net $1,123 $885 net interest expense in 2022 deleveraged 24 basis points primarily as a result of interest expense related to the issuance of $5.0 billion unsecured notes in march 2022 and $4.8 billion unsecured notes in september 2022. income tax provision - our effective income tax rate was 28.8% in 2022 compared to 24.7% in 2021. the 2022 rate was unfavorably impacted by the partial deductibility of long-lived asset impairment and loss on sale associated with the canadian retail business. fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 for a comparison of our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and capital resources for the fiscal years ended january 28, 2022, and january 29, 2021, see \"part ii, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\" of our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended january 28, 2022, filed with the sec on march 21, 2022. financial condition, liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity cash flows from operations, combined with our continued access to capital markets on both a short-term and long-term basis, as needed, remain adequate to fund our operations, make strategic investments to support long-term growth, and return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. we believe these sources of liquidity will continue to support our business for the next twelve months. as of february 3, 2023, we held $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents, as well as $3.5 billion in undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facilities. as of february 3, 2023, our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments consist of leases, long-term debt, purchase obligations, and letters of credit. see note 6, note 8, and note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial 26 statements in item 8, \"financial statements and supplementary data\", of this annual report for amounts outstanding related to leases, long-term debt, and commitments, respectively, as of february 3, 2023. cash flows provided by operating activities (in millions) 2022 2021 net cash provided by operating activities $8,589 $10,113 cash flows from operating activities continued to provide the primary source of our liquidity. the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended february 3, 2023, compared to the year ended january 28, 2022, was due primarily to changes in working capital. inventory decreased operating cash flow for fiscal 2022 by approximately $2.6 billion compared to a decrease of $1.4 billion for fiscal 2021. accounts payable decreased operating cash flow for fiscal 2022 by $549 million compared to an increase of $466 million in fiscal 2021, driving a reduction of $1.0 billion in operating cash flows for fiscal 2022. the increase in inventory is primarily due to product cost and freight inflation compared to the prior year, as well as lower inventory turns year-over-year. the decrease in accounts payable is driven by timing of inventory purchases in the prior year. other operating liabilities increased operating cash flows $388 million for fiscal 2022 compared to a decrease of $570 million in fiscal 2021. this increase is primarily driven by the deferral of payment of our third and fourth quarter estimated federal tax payments under the income tax relief announced by the internal revenue service for business located in states impacted by hurricane ian. cash flows used in investing activities (in millions) 2022 2021 net cash used in investing activities $(1,309) $(1,646) net cash used in investing activities primarily consists of transactions related to capital expenditures, offset by proceeds from the sale of the canadian retail business. capital expenditures our capital expenditures generally consist of investments in our strategic initiatives to enhance our ability to serve customers, improve existing stores, and support expansion plans. capital expenditures were $1.8 billion in 2022 and $1.9 billion in 2021. the following table provides the allocation of capital expenditures for 2022 and 2021: 2022 2021 existing store

payments. total debt in 2022, we issued $9.8 billion of unsecured notes. this is comprised of $5.0 billion of unsecured notes issued in march 2022 and $4.8 billion of unsecured notes issued in september 2022, the proceeds of which were designated for general corporate purposes. in 2022, we paid approximately $765 million to retire scheduled debts at maturity. we have a $2.0 billion five-year unsecured revolving third amended and restated credit agreement (the third amended and restated credit agreement), with a syndicate of banks, which has a maturity date of december 2026 and an aggregate availability of $2.0 billion. we also have a $2.0 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement dated march 23, 2020, and as amended, (the 2020 credit agreement) with a syndicate of banks, which has a maturity date of december 2026 and an aggregate availability of $2.0 billion. subject to obtaining commitments from the lenders and satisfying other conditions specified in the 2020 credit agreement and the third amended and restated credit agreement (collectively, the credit agreements), the company may increase the combined aggregate availability of the credit agreements by an additional $1.0 billion. the credit agreements support our commercial paper program. the amount available to be drawn under the credit agreements is reduced by the amount of borrowings under our commercial paper program. outstanding borrowings under the company's commercial paper program were $499 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.78% as of february 3, 2023. there were no outstanding borrowings under the 2020 credit agreement or the third amended and restated credit agreement as of february 3, 2023. there were no outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper

repurchase program, authorized by the company's board of directors, that is executed through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private off-market transactions. we also withhold shares from employees to satisfy tax withholding liabilities on share-based payments. shares repurchased are returned to authorized and unissued status. the following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the total number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share, and the total amount paid for share repurchases for 2022 and 2021: (in millions, except per share data)

remaining under our share repurchase program with no expiration date. dividends in the third quarter of 2022, we increased our quarterly dividend payment by 31% to $1.05 per share. our dividend payment dates are established such that dividends are paid in the quarter immediately following the quarter in which they are declared. the following table provides additional information related to our dividend payments for 2022 and 2021: (in millions, except per share data and percentage data) 2022 2021 total cash dividend payments $2,370 $1,984 dividends paid per share $3.70 $2.80 dividend payout ratio 37 % 24 % capital resources we expect to continue to have access to the capital markets on both short-term and long-term bases when needed for liquidity purposes by issuing commercial paper or new long-term debt. the availability and the borrowing costs of these funds could be adversely affected, however, by a downgrade of our debt ratings or a deterioration of certain financial ratios. the table below reflects our debt ratings by standard & poor's (s&p) and moody's as of march 27, 2023, which is disclosed to provide an enhanced understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effect of our ratings on our cost of funds. our debt ratings have enabled, and should continue to enable, us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. our commercial paper and senior debt ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. debt ratings s&amp;p moody's commercial paper a-2 p-2 senior debt bbb+ baa1 outlook stable stable there are no provisions in any agreements that would require early cash settlement of existing debt or leases as a result of a downgrade in our debt rating or a decrease in our stock price. critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this annual report requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. we base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates. our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included herein. we believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. merchandise inventory description we record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost. this reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience. during 2022, our reserve decreased approximately $29 million to $139 million as of february 3, 2023. we also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories. this reserve is based primarily on actual shrink results from previous physical inventories. during 2022, the inventory shrink reserve increased approximately $14 million to $428 million as of february 3, 2023, in response to higher volumes and estimated shrinkage rates based on results from previous physical inventories. in addition, we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, sales, early payments or promotions of vendors' products. generally, these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor's product. many of the vendor funds associated with these purchases are earned under agreements that are negotiated on an annual basis or shorter. the funds are recorded as a reduction to the cost of inventory as they are earned. as the related inventory is sold, the amounts are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors' products are recorded as an offset to the related expense. judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate we do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term, and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions. however, changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves. likewise, changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary, based on the timing and results of physical inventories. we also apply judgment in the determination of levels of obsolete inventory and assumptions about net realizable value. for vendor funds, we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place. due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreements, we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year, adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded. amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met. effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for obsolete inventory or inventory shrinkage during the past three fiscal years. we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves. however, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves. a 10% change in either the amount of products considered obsolete or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our obsolete inventory reserve would each have affected net earnings by approximately $10 million for 2022. a 10% change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrink reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately $32 million for 2022. we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years. if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory. however, substantially all receivables associated with these activities do not require subjective long-term estimates because they are collected within the following fiscal year. adjustments to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material. long-lived asset impairment description we review the carrying amounts of long-lived assets whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. when evaluating long-lived assets for impairment, our asset group is generally at an individual location level, as that is the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable. cash flows for individual locations do not include an allocation of corporate overhead. we evaluate locations for triggering events relating to long-lived asset impairment on a quarterly basis to determine when a location's assets may not be recoverable. for operating locations, our primary indicator that assets may not be recoverable is consistently negative cash flow for a twelve month period for those locations that have been open in the same location for a sufficient period of time to allow for meaningful analysis of ongoing operating results. management also monitors other factors when evaluating operating locations for impairment, including individual locations' execution of their operating plans and local market conditions, including incursion, which is the opening of either other lowe's locations or those of a direct competitor within the same market. we also consider there to be a triggering event when there is a current expectation that it is more likely than not that a given location will be closed or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. during the third quarter of 2022, the company determined it was more likely than not that the assets within the canadian retail business would be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful lives and were evaluated for recoverability. based on the proposed transaction, the company reconsidered the appropriate asset grouping of long-lived assets attributable to the company's canadian locations given the change in the company's expectations regarding use and disposition of its associated assets. the company determined the total canada retail business (canada asset group) to be the appropriate asset group for which canadian business assets should be evaluated, as this represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. changes in asset group determinations are accounted for on a prospective basis. a potential impairment has occurred if the fair value of the asset group is less than the asset group's carrying value. the carrying value of an operating location's asset group includes inventory, property, operating and finance lease right-of-use assets and operating liabilities including accounts payables, accrued compensation, and operating lease liabilities. financial and nonoperating liabilities are excluded from the carrying value of the asset group. when determining the stream of projected future cash flows associated with an individual operating location, management makes assumptions, incorporating local market conditions, about key store variables including sales growth rates, gross margin and controllable expenses, such as store payroll and operating expense, as well as asset residual values or lease rates. operating lease payments are included in the projected future cash flows. financing lease payments are excluded from the projected future cash flows. an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the operating location is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. the carrying value of the canada asset group included substantially all assets and liabilities of the canadian retail business, including accounts receivable, inventory, property, operating and finance lease right-of-use assets, definite-lived intangible assets, operating liabilities including accounts payable and accrued compensation, and operating and finance lease liabilities. the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment balance was excluded from the carrying value of the canada asset group in evaluating the recoverability of a held and used asset group. we use an income approach to determine the fair value of our individual operating locations, which requires discounting projected future cash flows. this involves making assumptions regarding both a location's future cash flows, as described above, and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash flows. we discount our cash flow estimates at a rate commensurate with the risk that selected market participants would assign to the cash flows. the selected market participants represent a group of other retailers with a market footprint similar in size to ours. we use a market approach to determine the fair value of our individual locations identified for sale or closure. this involves making assumptions regarding the estimated selling prices or estimated lease rates by obtaining information from property brokers or appraisers in the specific markets being evaluated. the information includes comparable sales of similar assets and assumptions about demand in the market for purchase or lease of these assets. a market approach of an orderly transaction under current market conditions was used in determining the estimated fair value of the canada asset group, which was based on the proposed transaction price, inclusive of performance-based contingent consideration. judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate our impairment evaluations require us to apply judgment in determining whether a triggering event has occurred, including the evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed or an asset will be otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flows, including estimated sales, margin, and controllable expenses, assumptions about market performance for operating locations, and estimated selling prices or lease rates for locations identified for closure. we also apply judgment in estimating asset fair values, including the selection of an appropriate discount rate for fair values determined using an income approach. effect if actual results differ from assumptions during fiscal 2022, the company recorded $2.1 billion of long-lived asset impairment within selling, general and administrative expenses (sg&a) in the consolidated statements of earnings, which reflects the full carrying value of the long-lived assets of the canada asset group. during fiscal 2021, long-lived asset impairment was immaterial. if the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in determining whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its useful life or in estimating future cash flows and determining asset fair values, our actual impairment losses could vary from our estimated impairment losses. in the event that our estimates vary from actual results, we may record additional impairment losses, which could be material to our results of operations. self-insurance description we are self-insured for certain losses relating to workers' compensation, automobile, general and product liability, extended protection plans, and certain medical and dental claims. we have excess insurance coverage above certain retention amounts to limit exposure from single events and earnings volatility. our self-insured retention or deductible, as applicable, is limited to $2 million per occurrence involving workers' compensation, $10 million per occurrence involving general liability, product liability, and automobile liability. we do not have any excess insurance coverage for self-insured extended protection plan or medical and dental claims. self-insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for self-insured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience. during 2022, our self-insurance liabilities decreased approximately $45 million to $1.1 billion as of february 3, 2023. judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate these estimates are subject to changes in the regulatory environment, utilized discount rate, projected exposures including payroll, sales and vehicle units, as well as the frequency, lag and severity of claims. effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our self-insurance liability during the past three fiscal years. although we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate losses related to claims, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded self-insurance liabilities. a 10% change in our self-insurance liability would have affected net earnings by approximately $80 million for 2022. a 100 basis point change in our discount rate would have affected net earnings by approximately $21 million for 2022.\"\"\"\n\n

When unsure, prefer inclusion over omission.\n    - Consider any descriptions of actions, resources, or decisions whose purpose, effect, or context may reasonably relate to \"organizational resilience\", even if not explicitly labeled as such.\n    - Avoid fabrication or speculation beyond the source. Maintain a formal, technical tone. Return only a single paragraph of plain text, without bullet points or formatting.\n    - You must always produce a summary paragraph, even if no clearly relevant content is found. Do not return an empty response. Do not begin the summary by stating that no relevant content was found. Instead, highlight any organizational, operational, or contextual content that may plausibly relate to \"organizational resilience\", even if weakly or implicitly.\n    "}]}}

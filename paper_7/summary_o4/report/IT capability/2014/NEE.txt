Nextera Energy’s management disclosed that during 2013 it conducted an enterprise-wide process focused on improving productivity and reducing operations and maintenance expenses, and in 2014 implemented initiatives arising from that process—an approach to prioritize resource allocation and sustain performance under external pressures. The Company employs derivative instruments—including swaps, options, futures and forwards—to manage commodity price risk inherent in fuel and power purchases and sales, with substantially all unrealized gains and losses on energy derivatives at FPL deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities until settlement, thereby preserving continuity of regulated operations. It maintains a diverse generation portfolio spanning rate-regulated electric utility operations, large-scale renewable energy projects and planned investments in additional wind, solar and natural gas infrastructure, demonstrating adaptability to environmental disruptions and the capacity to reconfigure its trajectory toward future objectives. Liquidity is supported by access to $7.85 billion of revolving credit facilities, commercial paper programs and proceeds from equity issuances, and as of December 31, 2014 the company retained the ability to absorb up to $122 million of future storm restoration costs without an immediate rate adjustment, illustrating preparedness for nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions. Ongoing capital structure planning—including targeted regulatory rates of return, compliance with financial covenants and maintenance of strong investment-grade credit ratings—and a track record of shareholder returns exceeding comparable indices further reflect the organization’s systemic resilience through resourcefulness, operational flexibility and strategic foresight.

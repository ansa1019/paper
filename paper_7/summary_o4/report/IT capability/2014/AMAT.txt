Applied’s businesses are subject to cyclical industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips, display technologies, solar PVs and other electronic devices, as well as other factors such as global economic and market conditions and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes, and in light of these conditions, Applied’s results can vary significantly year-over-year as well as quarter-over-quarter. To adapt to these external pressures, Applied has established strategic priorities to grow its presence in wafer fab and display equipment and services, improve profitability in solar and expand its overall available market, and management believes it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in research, development and engineering to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers’ most advanced designs. As part of its growth strategy, Applied has realigned its global workforce and reprioritized existing spend to enable increased funding for investments in technical capabilities and critical RD&E programs in current and new markets, and in October 2012 and May 2012 announced restructuring plans to realign its global workforce and restructure its energy and environmental solutions segment in light of challenging industry conditions. To support business continuity and liquidity, Applied believes that cash generated from operations, together with existing cash balances, investments and borrowing capability under unsecured credit facilities of $1.5 billion and other standby letters of credit and guarantee instruments, will be sufficient to satisfy liquidity requirements for the next 12 months, and it regularly monitors credit risk in its investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures to manage such risks prudently in accordance with its investment policies. To preserve system integrity and performance under internal or external variations and disturbances, Applied recognizes revenue only when all revenue recognition criteria are met and collectability is probable, provides for estimated warranty costs based on product configuration and support cost data, states inventories at the lower of cost or market to reflect anticipated obsolescence, and reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable; management bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable and will reassess and update its forecasts and estimates used in future impairment analyses as new information and business conditions evolve.

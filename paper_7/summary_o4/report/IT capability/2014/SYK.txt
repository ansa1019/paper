Stryker’s global business continuity and operational flexibility are supported by a diversified distribution network spanning more than 100 countries through company-owned sales subsidiaries, branches and third-party dealers and by separate dedicated sales forces for each principal product line to provide focused expertise and adapt to seasonal or market fluctuations. Our mission to “make healthcare better” reflects a systemic perspective and inter-organizational collaboration in co-developing innovative products and services with customers, thereby absorbing strain and preserving or improving functioning in challenging conditions. We believe our competitive advantage and organizational health depend on the ability to develop new products and enhance existing ones, supported by sustained investment in research, development and engineering (6.3% of sales in 2014), and on a disciplined capital allocation strategy that prioritizes acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases to reconfigure resources toward growth and resilience. Strategic acquisitions of Small Bone Innovations, Berchtold and Patient Safety Technologies strengthened our capabilities, simplified the customer experience and generated operational efficiencies. Active working capital management—increasing inventory to support sales and acquisitions while reducing days sales outstanding—ensures liquidity and resource deployment under changing conditions. Strong operating cash flow, ready access to capital markets and robust debt ratings provide financial resilience, with excess cash funding acquisitions and infrastructure upgrades and the option to supplement with debt as needed. The use of non-GAAP measures such as constant-currency sales growth and adjusted net earnings enhances management’s ability to assess underlying performance trends, synchronize incentives with strategic objectives and maintain positive adjustment under external pressures. Risk mitigation practices—including forward currency exchange contracts to hedge foreign-currency exposures—and the recording of provisions at the minimum of probable loss for product recalls, uncertain tax positions and legal contingencies preserve system integrity and readiness for adverse events. Continuous evaluation of defined benefit pension funding, contractual obligations and off-balance-sheet arrangements supports our preparedness, adaptability and maintenance of performance under uncertainty, embodying organizational resilience as the ability to absorb strain and emerge stronger from dynamic, disruptive environments.

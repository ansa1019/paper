In 2014, as part of its strategy to transform the business to attain approximately 50% of revenue from high-growth adjacent markets by the end of 2015, the Company continued to focus on introducing a more diverse product portfolio, publicly demonstrated its ambidextrous computing roadmap and launched differentiated products to address shifting consumer and enterprise demands, re-profiling its debt maturity schedule by repurchasing high-interest notes and modifying supply agreements with GlobalFoundries to establish volume purchase commitments and fixed pricing for the calendar year while negotiating transitional supply terms to ensure uninterrupted wafer supply. Management realigned the organizational structure effective July 1, 2014 into two reportable segments to enhance operational flexibility, and implemented an October restructuring plan involving a 6% global headcount reduction, real estate footprint adjustments and facility consolidations designed to improve operating efficiencies. Throughout the period, capital and resource allocation decisions—such as issuing $1.1 billion of senior notes, utilizing a secured revolving credit facility to fund strategic repurchases and maintaining cash and marketable securities balances—were employed to preserve financial stability, absorb external market pressures and support ongoing R&D and product development initiatives. The Company’s adjustments to segment reporting, debt structure, supply chain arrangements and workforce underline its ability to absorb strain, maintain performance under challenging conditions and position itself to respond promptly to environmental perturbations, competitive dynamics and supply disruptions.

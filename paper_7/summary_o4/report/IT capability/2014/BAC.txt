Management has established a comprehensive resilience framework spanning strategic, credit, market, liquidity, operational and compliance risks, overseen by the board’s enterprise risk committee and management risk committee, and anchored by a strong risk culture that promotes sound risk taking within defined risk appetites.  Forward‐looking stress tests, including historical and hypothetical scenarios that simulate nominal, extreme or exceptional market and economic perturbations, inform capital contingency planning, liquidity coverage ratio compliance, net stable funding ratio readiness, recovery planning and enterprise resiliency protocols to ensure positive adjustment under challenging conditions.  A centralized treasury function optimizes the balance sheet by shifting from less liquid loans into more liquid securities, diversifies funding sources, and maintains global excess liquidity buffers, enabling timely responses to funding stresses and supporting uninterrupted business continuity.  Robust governance processes and risk management routines require all front‐line units to identify, measure, monitor and control risk exposures, while corporate audit and independent risk management functions provide challenge and oversight.  Business segment realignments, cost‐savings and Project New BAC initiatives, streamlined processes, targeted resource reallocation and enhanced operational and compliance controls further strengthen the organization’s ability to sustain performance, reconstitute operations and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

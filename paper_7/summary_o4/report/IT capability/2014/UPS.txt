During 2014, management confronted an uneven global growth environment and the resulting shifts in trade patterns by dynamically adjusting its air capacity and cost structure to better align with prevailing volume mixes, flexibly redeploying internal and contracted transportation resources across both nominal and extreme trade lanes to preserve service reliability. Its broad portfolio of product offerings and the flexibilities inherent in its transportation network enabled rapid adaptation to overcapacity and shifting customer mix driven by e-commerce and omni-channel retail trends. The company undertook several initiatives—most notably facility automation projects and the accelerated roll-out of its on-road Integrated Optimization and Navigation system (“ORION”)—to increase network capacity, operational efficiency, flexibility and reliability, while continuing to adjust its network and utilize expanded operating facilities to improve time-in-transit. Ongoing network efficiency and productivity improvements, including better pick-up and delivery densities and matching increases in package volume with aircraft block hours and vehicle miles, helped mitigate cost pressures under adverse weather conditions and significant holiday volume spikes, even as the fourth-quarter variability prompted temporary capacity surges through additional staffing, equipment rentals and an extra operating day. In international operations, similar adaptive responses—modifying network utilization, employing outside carriers to address regional capacity constraints, shifting product and customer mix toward standard services and executing service enhancements—helped sustain performance under fuel price fluctuations and currency translation impacts. Strategic rate increases, annual fuel surcharge index adjustments and derivative hedging programs have served as financial risk-mitigation mechanisms to maintain system integrity and performance. The company also restructured its postretirement healthcare and pension liabilities through multiemployer plan transfers and a long-term withdrawal agreement, thereby reallocating resources and reducing future funding uncertainties. Across all segments, the firm’s ongoing refinement of operating expense allocations and non-GAAP performance measures reflects a systemic perspective on organizational health, supporting the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

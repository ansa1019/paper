In the third quarter of fiscal 2014, following confirmation that our payment data systems were breached and deployment of custom-built malware on self-checkout systems, we eliminated the breach on September 18, 2014 and completed a major payment security project in September 2014 providing enhanced encryption of payment card data at the point of sale in all U.S. stores, rolled out enhanced encryption to Canadian stores and commenced deployment of EMV chip-and-pin technology in U.S. stores to make raw payment card information unreadable to unauthorized users, actions that exemplify our ability to absorb strain, preserve functioning and maintain system integrity under adverse conditions. We continue to support law enforcement efforts, investigate potential claims from payment card networks and other litigants, record $63 million of pretax expenses related to the data breach partially offset by expected insurance proceeds and monitor and estimate losses when they become both probable and reasonably estimable, while maintaining $100 million of network security and privacy liability insurance coverage above a deductible to limit exposure and ensure business continuity. Our disciplined capital allocation and liquidity management—evidenced by $8.2 billion of cash flow from operations, $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents, access to $2.0 billion of commercial paper backed by a credit facility, and the ability to issue long-term debt coupled with active interest rate swap arrangements—enable us to fund capital expenditures, dividend payments, share repurchases under accelerated share repurchase agreements and acquisitions such as HD Supply Hardware Solutions, thereby reconfiguring resource allocation to support strategic initiatives and operational flexibility. Through our key initiatives—simplifying customer service with our handheld mobile customer service tool, advancing product authority via merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy employing assortment planning and pricing tools, continuous operational improvement in stores and supply chain, and building an interconnected retail platform integrating buy online, pick-up in store, ship to store and pilot buy online, deliver from store programs supported by direct fulfillment centers—we drive adaptability, resource reconfiguration, systemic change and multichannel resilience to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and sustain firm performance in a volatile market environment.

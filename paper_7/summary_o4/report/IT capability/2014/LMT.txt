We operate in an environment characterized by both increasing complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally, prompting a significant component of our strategy to focus on program execution, improving quality and predictability and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S. and international customers at affordable prices. Recognizing that our customers are resource constrained, we endeavor to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner with a focus on adjacent markets close to our core capabilities, as well as to grow international sales and continue affordability initiatives. We expect to invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements and in our people so that we have the technical skills necessary to succeed without limiting our ability to return free cash flow, reflecting an emphasis on internal knowledge, workforce adaptability and resource allocation. Despite the protracted uncertainty surrounding U.S. government budgets, the investments and acquisitions we have made in recent years seek to align our businesses with the most critical national priorities and mission areas, and we are seeking to lessen our dependence on government contracts by expanding into adjacent markets and growing international sales, thereby mitigating the risk of external fiscal constraints. We constantly identify and monitor risks to the achievement of technical, schedule and cost aspects of our contracts and adjust profit booking rates as risks are retired or emerge, estimating total costs to complete and recognizing incentive fees or penalties as they become determinable, thereby reconfiguring our resource deployment and maintaining operational flexibility. Concurrent performance of development and production contracts on complex programs such as the F-35 accelerates fielding, tests new systems under actual conditions and achieves overall cost savings, demonstrating systemic resilience. Portfolio shaping activities including independent R&D, acquisitions, divestitures and internal realignments are designed to leverage existing capabilities, enhance service innovation and preserve or improve functioning despite fragmentation of budgets and market pressures. In response to U.S. government budget reductions and sequestration, which could disrupt ongoing programs, impact the supply chain, terminate contracts, close facilities and accelerate the loss of skills and knowledge, we have implemented strategic realignments that include facility consolidations, workforce reductions, accelerated depreciation and relocation of equipment, all with the intent to maintain organizational health, support business continuity and recover restructuring charges through contract pricing. To support our performance maintenance, we have adopted a balanced cash deployment strategy, increasing dividends, authorizing share repurchases and maintaining liquidity through an expanded revolving credit facility and commercial paper capacity, while continuously updating outlook assumptions to address variability in working capital, tax payments and pension funding under both GAAP and government cost accounting standards. This comprehensive approach to capital expenditures, acquisitions, cash management and contract risk mitigation underlines our ability to absorb internal and external disturbances, preserve system integrity and emerge stronger from challenging situations.

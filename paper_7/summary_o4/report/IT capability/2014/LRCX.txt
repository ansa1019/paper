Management’s discussion and analysis emphasizes the company’s capacity to maintain performance under volatile market conditions, noting that our market-leading deposition, etch and clean equipment and services leverage semiconductor processing expertise to deliver lower defect rates, enhanced yields, faster processing times and reduced cost, thus facilitating customer adherence to stringent performance and design standards under evolving technology inflections such as FinFET transistors, 3-D NAND and multiple patterning. While industry consolidation has moderated demand cycles, variability in customer investments—driven by electronics demand, economic conditions and supply–demand dynamics—requires operational flexibility, adaptability and proactive resource allocation, as evidenced by steady fiscal 2014 revenue growth, market share gains and an $866 million unshipped order backlog. The acquisition of Novellus Systems was executed to reconfigure our product portfolio, generate cost synergies, expand capabilities and enhance strategic research and development investments. We maintain significant liquidity reserves, with approximately $3.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, to support R&D and capital infrastructure, manage indebtedness and mitigate risks over the next 12 months and beyond. Forward-looking statements addressing uncertainties in risk factors further reflect our resilience strategies and systemic perspective on potential disruptions. Critical accounting policies and estimates underscore the system integrity of our financial reporting, requiring management judgments to ensure accurate performance measurement amid internal and external variations.

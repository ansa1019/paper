Oracle develops and maintains its products and services to be enterprise-grade, reliable, secure and interoperable—engineered to work both together or independently across cloud and on-premise deployment models—thereby enabling customers to evolve and transform their IT environments at a pace appropriate to their objectives and to sustain operational continuity despite external pressures or unexpected situations. Its cloud computing offerings, including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, are designed to be attractive and cost-effective options that integrate software and hardware in IT environments the company deploys, supports and manages on customers’ behalf, while its Oracle engineered systems combine hardware and software to increase computing performance relative to competitors, create cost efficiencies, time savings and operational cost advantages, and serve as core infrastructure for both Oracle Cloud services and customer data centers. An important element of Oracle’s corporate strategy is to deliver reliable, scalable products and services built upon industry standards and to support ongoing customer choice through continued innovation, targeted acquisitions and an active acquisition program that enhances product portfolios, accelerates innovation and expands the customer base—actions intended to mitigate risk, optimize resource allocation, strengthen competitive advantage and maintain organizational effectiveness under challenging or extreme conditions. The company designs hardware systems with virtualization and management capabilities for rapid deployment and efficient management of cloud and on-premise infrastructures and simplifies manufacturing through standardized, build-to-order processes that preserve system integrity. Sustained business continuity is further reinforced by software license updates and product support and hardware systems support contracts—generally one year in duration and renewed by substantially all customers—and by consulting services for enterprise architecture planning, initial implementation, integration and ongoing enhancements delivered via a global blended delivery model. Oracle evaluates the financial impact of potential acquisitions on earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital before execution, funding them through internally available cash, marketable securities, operations, additional borrowings or issuances of securities to preserve resource sufficiency and system resilience. To manage exposure to foreign currency and interest rate variability, Oracle presents constant currency results for underlying performance assessment, enters into cross-currency and interest rate swap agreements and sells financings as true sales, all intended to maintain performance under pressure and preserve or improve functioning in the presence of adversity.

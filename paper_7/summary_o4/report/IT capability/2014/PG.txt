Management’s strategic focus on long‐term organizational health and total shareholder return drives resource allocation to leading, most profitable categories and markets and the narrowing and refocusing of the portfolio to compete where the size of the prize and probability of winning are highest, while resorting to partnerships, divestitures or discontinuations of non-strategic assets. Innovation is described as the company’s lifeblood, requiring a full portfolio of commercial programs, product improvements and game-changing innovations to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and reconfigure trajectories toward future growth. To address high levels of competitive activity and a fast‐paced, rapidly changing environment, management responds to competitive factors such as pricing, promotional incentives, trade terms and product initiatives, and maintains mutually beneficial customer relationships to preserve performance. Productivity is characterized as a core strength that creates flexibility to fund growth efforts and deliver financial commitments, and the company has taken significant steps to accelerate productivity and savings across cost of goods sold, marketing expense and non-manufacturing overhead to mitigate cost pressures and sustain performance under pressure. Operating discipline and execution are highlighted as core capabilities and competitive advantages essential to resilience, supported by ongoing cost improvement plans, outsourcing relationships and workforce optimization, and by the ability to manage fluctuations in commodity prices, raw material availability, foreign exchange and interest rates through pricing actions, sourcing decisions and hedging transactions. Management also underscores the need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, the security and continuity of information technology systems, and the adaptability of its global cash management and financing structures—including undrawn bank credit facilities and high credit ratings—to ensure liquidity and fund operating needs, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions. The risk factors discussion further addresses the organization’s capacity to confront global economic uncertainty, political unrest, natural disasters, sovereign credit risks and regulatory changes by diversifying operations across approximately 70 countries and leveraging natural hedges for interest rate, currency rate and commodity exposures, thereby enhancing system resilience and preserving functioning under internal and external variations.

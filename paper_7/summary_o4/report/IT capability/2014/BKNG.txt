The company recognizes that factors beyond its control, such as worldwide recession, oil prices, terrorist attacks, unusual weather patterns and natural disasters including earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods and volcanic eruptions, as well as pandemics, political instability and civil unrest, could adversely affect its business and impair its ability to implement initiatives or achieve operating objectives. For example, late 2012’s Hurricane Sandy disrupted travel in the northeastern United States, early 2011’s earthquake and tsunami in Japan and severe flooding, civil unrest and temporary relocation of operations in Thailand have negatively impacted booking volumes, cancellation rates and required the relocation of agoda.com’s Thailand-based operations, and future natural disasters, health concerns or political unrest may further disrupt operations. In response to volatile foreign exchange rates that may affect gross bookings, revenues and gross profit when translated into U.S. dollars, the company generally enters into derivative instruments to minimize short-term currency fluctuations, though such hedges are not designed for longer-term exchange-rate volatility. The uncertainty of macroeconomic factors and currency rate swings, which may differentially affect consumer behavior across regions, makes forecasting industry and consumer trends more difficult and may adversely affect management’s ability to effectively steer the business. The company also competes in an intensely competitive online and traditional travel market, requiring strategic investments in technology, personnel, aggressive marketing and brand-building even when those expenditures create pressure on operating margins, in order to maintain and enhance its worldwide leadership in reservation services. Investments in new services—such as the global expansion of OpenTable to enhance end-to-end customer experiences across desktop and mobile—are expected to pressure near-term profitability but are pursued to strengthen long-term operating results and support future growth. Moreover, hotels’ limited opaque-room availability during high-occupancy periods has adversely affected opaque-reservation margins, underscoring the need for diversified service offerings. Seasonal patterns—including the timing of holidays such as Easter and peak travel quarters in Europe, North America, Asia-Pacific and South America—lead to significant fluctuations in gross bookings, revenue recognition and profitability, which the company monitors to manage its operational flexibility and resource deployment. Regulatory actions—such as investigations into rate-parity clauses, potential changes in tax statutes and travel transaction tax assessments—could require changes to contractual practices, increase contingent liabilities for taxes and penalties and materially affect competitive position and financial performance. To preserve financial integrity and maintain performance under challenging conditions, the company reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability, establishes accruals for probable legal and tax contingencies, and applies judgment in accounting estimates for tax positions, intangible-asset valuations, stock-based compensation and impairment assessments, thereby sustaining its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity.

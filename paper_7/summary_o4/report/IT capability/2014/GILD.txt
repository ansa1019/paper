In its 2014 MD&A, management articulates a multifaceted approach to sustaining organizational resilience—understood as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions—through disciplined resource allocation, risk mitigation and adaptive planning. The company asserts that “our existing capital resources, supplemented by our cash flows generated from operating activities, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future,” while hedging a percentage of its foreign currency exposure through foreign exchange contracts to mitigate volatility. Financing agility is evidenced by the issuance of senior unsecured notes across multiple maturities, proactive debt repayments, access to a five-year revolving credit facility and opportunistic share repurchase authorizations intended to offset dilution and optimize capital structure. Management describes a systematic process for R&D prioritization—“identifying the R&D activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources”—with continual pipeline reviews and resource reallocation to support future growth. Likewise, SG&A investments in headcount, infrastructure and global commercial expansion, together with inter-organizational collaborations through licensing and acquisition agreements, illustrate strategic initiatives to preserve operational flexibility and competitive advantage. The discussion of contractual commitments for active pharmaceutical ingredients and clinical CROs, combined with recognition of uncertainties in healthcare pricing, payer negotiations, regulatory approvals and foreign exchange rates, underscores the company’s capacity to absorb external pressures, reconfigure resource deployment and maintain performance in the face of adversity, all while adhering to prudent accounting policies for allowances, contingent liabilities and valuation of intangible assets.

The firm’s disclosures emphasize the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions through a comprehensive business continuity plan, information security program, risk management and liquidity policies, supported by substantial pre-funding of highly liquid assets to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in a stressed environment. In order to ensure appropriate risk management and operational flexibility, the firm maintains a liquid balance sheet and employs dynamic asset-liability management processes, including quarterly planning, business-specific limits, daily monitoring of key metrics and scenario analyses covering both short- and long-term horizons under various macroeconomic and firm-specific assumptions. These analyses inform approaches for maintaining liquidity, funding and capital adequacy in severely adverse scenarios, while a contingency funding plan provides a framework for analyzing and responding to liquidity crises, delineating escalation protocols, responsibilities and mitigants for collateral outflows and intraday liquidity needs. To mitigate refinancing and credit risks, the firm executes term trades with staggered maturities, diversifies counterparties, raises excess secured funding, applies netting and collateral arrangements, and conducts regular stress tests—such as sovereign default scenarios—that estimate direct and indirect impacts on exposures. Risk governance is reinforced by a culture of collaboration among revenue-producing units, independent control and support functions, and senior management, with extensive use of firmwide, divisional and product committees to identify, manage and mitigate market, credit, liquidity and operational risks. Operational resilience is further supported by robust controls, policies and training designed to minimize internal process failures, system disruptions, fraud and external events, and by significant investment in risk management technology to ensure timely, accurate information for decision making. Finally, the firm’s capital planning and stress-testing processes, including annual CCAR and DFAST exercises and internal risk-based capital assessments, attribute capital usage by business, incorporate counterparty credit assessments and model severe multivariate stress scenarios to ensure that equity and capital buffers remain sufficient to absorb strain, preserve functioning and emerge stronger from extreme conditions.

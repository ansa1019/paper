UnitedHealth Group continually evaluates demographic, regulatory and competitive pressures and adjusts its product pricing and provider network arrangements to sustain business continuity and preserve operating performance under challenging conditions. The company’s pricing strategy starts with an expectation of future costs and incorporates environmental, legislative and macro-economic considerations, balancing growth and profitability across local markets. In response to ongoing Medicare Advantage funding reductions and ACA fees, UnitedHealth Group intensified its medical and operating cost management, reconfigured care provider network size and composition, adjusted member benefits and premiums on a county-by-county basis, and pursued actuarially sound rates to mitigate risk and partner for the long-term viability of state programs. Delivery system modernization and payment reform initiatives, including value-based, full-risk and shared-risk arrangements covering nearly $37 billion, reflect a systemic perspective and alignment of incentives to coordinate care, reduce costs and improve quality—supported by investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems. The company’s liquidity management employs dynamic forecasting of cash flows, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to maintain financial flexibility and access committed bank credit facilities, commercial paper and long-term debt issuances for acquisitions, capital expenditures and share repurchases. UnitedHealth Group’s actuarial estimation of medical costs payable, CMS risk adjustment revenues and premium rebate liabilities uses sophisticated models of claim submissions, utilization trends, demographic shifts and regulatory adjustments to preserve system integrity and performance under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

In 2014, the company executed a strategic portfolio rationalization by divesting non-core assets and completing the sale of McGraw Hill Construction and Aviation Week, using the proceeds to make selective acquisitions and investments, pay down short-term debt, and continue share repurchases—actions that reconfigured its resource base and preserved liquidity to support ongoing operations; management further maintained operational flexibility by streamlining infrastructure, reducing its real estate footprint, consolidating its corporate headquarters, and disposing of non-core facilities such as its data center and corporate aircraft, thereby preserving capital and enhancing business continuity. The company continued to generate increased free cash flow through improved receivables collections, favorable tax planning and timing, disciplined expense management—including rigorous allocation of shared service costs to business segments based on usage and segment operating profit—and retained access to its secured credit facility to ensure sufficient working capital and funding under varying market conditions. As part of its transformation to McGraw Hill Financial, management aligned its efforts against two key strategic priorities—creating growth through customer focus and innovation, and driving performance via operational excellence, productivity, risk management, and compliance—reflecting a systemic perspective on anticipating environmental disruptions, mitigating risks, adapting organizational capabilities, and preserving performance under pressure. Ongoing investments in digital capabilities, integration of cross-asset analytics and market data, and the continued evolution of benchmarks, ratings and analytics services underscore the company’s commitment to maintaining positive adjustment in volatile markets and emerging stronger from external challenges.

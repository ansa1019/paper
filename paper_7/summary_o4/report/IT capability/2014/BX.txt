Blackstone’s annual report underscores that its businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic environments in the U.S., Europe and Asia and that the composition of its revenues will vary based on market conditions and the cyclicality of its different businesses, reflecting a systemic perspective on external pressures.  To maintain continuity and adaptability under such variations, the firm “manages its business using traditional financial measures and key operating metrics,” including economic income as a benchmark of value creation and a guide to resource deployment and compensation decisions, fee-related earnings to assess whether recurring revenues cover operating expenses, distributable earnings to evaluate liquidity available for unitholder distributions, and adjusted EBITDA to gauge its ability to service borrowings.  Blackstone closely monitors assets under management and fee-earning assets under management—the latter defined as the assets on which management and/or performance fees are earned—by tracking inflows, outflows, market appreciation or depreciation and realizations, and maintains “dry powder,” or committed undrawn capital, as an indicator of available capital for future investments.  It leverages detailed segment analysis—measuring net IRRs, multiples of invested capital, segment economic income and net appreciation—to inform strategic responses, reconfigure trajectories in immediate response to disruptive events, reconstitute capital for ensuing market conditions and drive service innovation across its private equity, real estate, hedge fund solutions and credit businesses.  The report also describes how Blackstone’s real estate platform weathered environmental perturbations—volatility spikes, widening credit spreads, central bank policy shifts and regional liquidity dislocations—by capitalizing on improving fundamentals, recovering debt markets and opportunistic spin-off transactions, illustrating its operational flexibility, risk mitigation mechanisms and resilience engineering in the face of market turbulence.

Our strategy is to deliver integrated architectures, solutions, and outcomes to help our customers grow, manage costs, and mitigate risk, driving innovation, speed, agility, and efficiencies to maintain integrity and performance under market variations; as part of our transformation from selling individual products to integrated architectures and solutions, we are reorganizing how we are structured and how we deliver technology, reallocating resources to better meet customer requirements and stay ahead of market transitions; in light of reduced spending by service provider customers, economic and geopolitical challenges in emerging markets, and product transitions, we announced a restructuring plan impacting up to 6,000 employees and expect to reinvest substantially all cost savings in key growth areas such as data center, software, security, and cloud; inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need for supply chain flexibility and competitive lead times against the risk of obsolescence amid macroeconomic uncertainties, and we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and the adequacy of our purchase-commitment liabilities; we assess and record liabilities for product remediation costs, including a $655 million charge for memory-component failures, financing receivables, and tax contingencies, employ interest rate swaps to reduce financing risk, and perform annual goodwill impairment tests and sensitivity analyses that affirm the resilience of our reporting units under hypothetical fair-value declines; we believe our strong cash and cash equivalent balances, investments, free cash flow generation, and access to capital markets will enable us to address working capital needs, contractual obligations, strategic investments, and shareholder returns for at least the next twelve months.

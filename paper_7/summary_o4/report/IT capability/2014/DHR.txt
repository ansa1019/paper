Danaher’s MD&A describes a diversified, global business model and resource‐deployment strategies designed to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions: management notes that the company’s geographic and industry diversity, coupled with a broad range of products, software and services, “limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results,” while individual businesses “monitor key competitors and customers…to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future.” To address rapid technological development, regulatory pressures and macro‐economic uncertainties, Danaher “is making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources…in order to be responsive to the company’s customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the company’s operations.” In the second half of 2014, the company initiated restructuring actions “to improve productivity and reduce costs in its businesses,” resulting in pre‐tax charges that are expected to generate net savings in subsequent periods. Danaher emphasizes its ability to adapt through “innovative and differentiated new products, services and software with higher gross profit margins,” “expansion and improvement of the effectiveness of the company’s sales force,” continued cost reduction and operating-efficiency initiatives, and the “application of the Danaher Business System and the combined purchasing power” realized through the Nobel Biocare acquisition, which “expands the business’ geographic and product line diversity…as nobel biocare is integrated into the company.” Management expects ongoing year-over-year sales growth from existing businesses in both developed and high-growth markets, but remains “cautious about challenges due to macro-economic and geopolitical uncertainties,” and acknowledges that currency translation and acquisition integration may obscure underlying trends—reflecting an awareness of external pressures and the need for systemic flexibility to preserve performance under variable and unexpected conditions.

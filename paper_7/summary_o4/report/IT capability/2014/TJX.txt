The discussion highlights the company’s ability to absorb external pressures and preserve performance by generating strong cash flows to support dividends, share repurchases and reinvestment in growth initiatives such as new store openings, store remodels and infrastructure enhancements; employing inventory‐related hedging instruments and mark‐to‐market adjustments to mitigate currency volatility on merchandise costs; maintaining disciplined inventory valuation with markdown and shrinkage controls; establishing reserves for uncertain tax positions and former operations; and routinely assessing impairment of long‐lived assets, pension obligations and loss contingencies using market‐based assumptions. Scenario analyses anticipate the impact of strengthened foreign exchange rates on fiscal 2016 results, while a self‐insured casualty insurance program and long‐term purchase and lease commitments are managed through actuarial estimates and regular reviews. Capital expenditures of approximately $975 million are planned to be funded through internally generated funds, supported by robust liquidity from diverse financing sources, credit facilities and deferred tax strategies, all reflecting a systemic approach to maintaining integrity and continuity under both nominal and adverse conditions.

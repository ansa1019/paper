Berkshire Hathaway discloses that its operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis with minimal involvement by corporate headquarters, providing substantial operational flexibility and autonomy; senior corporate management retains ultimate responsibility for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and chief executive appointments at each operating business and also establishes and monitors governance practices—including communicating “tone at the top” and resolving governance issues—to preserve organizational coherence and performance under varying conditions.  A key strategy in its insurance operations is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength, with combined statutory surplus of approximately $129 billion at December 31, 2014, which enables the design of specialized reinsurance contracts to meet clients’ unique needs despite volatility.  The Company emphasizes that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and insists on safety over yield for its $42.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents (and $199.9 billion of total insurance‐held investments) and a float of about $84 billion that generated a negative cost over the past three years, reflecting a systemic focus on risk mitigation and resource sufficiency.  In its railroad segment, management acknowledges service‐related challenges and reports that it is working diligently to resolve capacity constraints without compromising safety, adding track expansion, systems improvements, equipment and personnel to improve and maintain service levels.  Overall, Berkshire’s balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base; the Board’s repurchase policy explicitly prevents share buybacks that would reduce consolidated cash below $20 billion, and the utilities, energy and finance subsidiaries regularly access credit markets to fund substantial capital expenditures (approximately $11.8 billion in 2014), while cautioning that restricted access to capital at affordable rates could materially impair operations—underscoring an organizational focus on resilience, risk management and the preservation of ongoing performance under internal or external pressures.

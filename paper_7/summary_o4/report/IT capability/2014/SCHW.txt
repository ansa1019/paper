The Company’s disclosures reflect a resilience‐oriented approach through the maintenance of excess liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits, short‐term investments and diversified funding sources—including committed unsecured credit facilities, a commercial paper program, subordinated revolving credit and uncommitted bank lines—together with dynamic balance‐sheet management to support its operating needs and regulatory capital requirements. It highlights a formal enterprise risk management framework, approved by its board and overseen by a global risk committee and specialized subcommittees for asset‐liability management, credit and market risk, operational risk (including human error, cyber attacks and natural disasters), model risk and fiduciary risk, all of which employ stress testing, scenario analysis and periodic reviews to identify, measure, monitor and mitigate emerging threats. The Company also maintains two data centers with backup and recovery functions, conducts regular disaster recovery and liquidity contingency tests (including access to Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank facilities), and enforces strict vendor management, information security and fraud prevention protocols to ensure business continuity. Its capital planning process incorporates forward‐looking assessments of regulatory changes (such as Basel III and LCR rules), stress‐testing for sustained economic downturns and idiosyncratic events, and the use of target leverage and risk‐based ratios to preserve performance under pressure. Credit resilience is further supported by an allowance for loan losses methodology that models defaults, loss severities, housing-price trends and borrower credit metrics, while ongoing litigation reserves and insurance settlements help safeguard capital, all combining to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite challenging conditions.

Management’s discussion and analysis includes forward-looking risk management and resource planning measures indicating the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including statements regarding SG&A and R&D spending forecasts, pursuit of additional financing and debt restructuring, use of cash on hand to fund share repurchases and the sufficiency of liquidity to meet requirements for at least the next twelve months. The company continuously evaluates alternatives for efficiently financing capital expenditures, dilution-management activities and ongoing operations through issuances of secured and unsecured debt, refinancing and restructuring of existing debt and discretionary share repurchases under board-authorized programs to ensure business continuity. The third quarter 2014 reorganization of business units, the acquisition and integration of Micron Memory Japan and the transition of wafer fabrication capacity from DRAM to NAND reflect adaptive reconfiguration of resources, operational flexibility and strategic response to environmental perturbations. Manufacturing cost reductions and product and process technology improvements underpin the company’s ability to preserve performance and strengthen competitive advantage, while obligations under supply agreements and purchase commitments illustrate proactive resource allocation and risk mitigation. Various restructure activities have been entered into to optimize operations, improve efficiency and focus on core memory operations, accruing liabilities to address underutilized capacity and workforce optimization. Significant investments in manufacturing technologies, facilities, capital equipment and R&D emphasize systemic innovation, future orientation and capacity for transformation. Liquidity management through cash generation of $5.70 billion, disciplined investing of $2.45 billion in property, plant and equipment and financing activities including $3.84 billion of debt repayments offset by $2.21 billion of new debt issuances demonstrate dynamic capabilities to absorb strain and maintain functioning. To mitigate credit risk, investments are made through high-credit-quality financial institutions with limited concentration of exposure. Strategic restructuring of convertible debt, including exchanges, conversions, repurchases and the establishment of capped calls, mitigates dilution risk and stabilizes capital structure, while off-balance sheet arrangements such as capped calls provide for the receipt of cash or shares if the stock’s trading price exceeds specified thresholds. Critical accounting estimates for business acquisitions, consolidations, contingencies, income taxes, inventory valuations and impairment reviews reflect organizational intelligence and system resilience in the face of volatility, supporting the company’s ability to adapt, recover and maintain integrity and performance under internal and external disturbances.

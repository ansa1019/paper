We invest more than $1 billion each year in product development and manufacturing technologies that differentiate our semiconductors and enable direct control of production, ensuring a consistent supply of products for our customers and supporting business continuity and operational flexibility. Our broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products gives us access to over 100,000 customers across diverse markets and reduces dependency on any single product or customer, allowing us to absorb demand fluctuations and preserve performance under changing conditions. By acquiring mature manufacturing assets ahead of demand and shifting the majority of future analog growth to 300-millimeter wafers, we reconfigure resource deployment to optimize margins and cash flow long term. Our largely fixed manufacturing costs mean that factory loadings directly affect profit margins, illustrating our ability to adapt to variations in shipment volumes. We allocate corporate-level expenses in proportion to segment operating expenses, realigning costs through restructuring actions—such as the wind-down of legacy wireless products—to focus on higher-growth opportunities without impacting consolidated profitability trends. Strong cash flow from operations, which rose to 30 percent of revenue and supported free cash flow of 27 percent of revenue, together with $3.5 billion of cash and short-term investments and undrawn credit facilities, underpins our liquidity and preparedness to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, and debt obligations for at least the next 12 months. These operational and financial measures reflect our ability to absorb strain, maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, and preserve or improve functioning despite internal or external variations.

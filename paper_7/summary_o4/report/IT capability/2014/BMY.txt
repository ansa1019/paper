Bristol-Myers Squibb continues to evolve its business to a leading diversified specialty biopharma company, a transformation accelerated by the diabetes business divestiture and a continued strategic focus on core therapeutic areas including immuno-oncology, and supported by expanding biologics manufacturing capacity at Devens, Massachusetts and plans to build a new facility in Ireland. In response to revenue declines driven by divestiture, exclusivity losses and changing product portfolios, the company has reallocated resources to optimize global brands, entered into clinical and commercial collaborations to combine opdivo with other targeted agents, and maintained disciplined capital allocation through business development, debt redemption and rigorous monitoring of working capital items such as receivables, inventories and payables. Its R&D programs are managed on a portfolio basis from early discovery through late-stage development, continually evaluated to balance early-stage and late-stage programs that may impact future revenue and earnings, while committing milestone payments and absorbing costs associated with program setbacks or clinical failures. To preserve liquidity and operational flexibility, BMS held $11.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at year end, maintains two $1.5 billion revolving credit facilities, factors certain receivables to limit default risk, and manages its debt and investment portfolios with high-quality counterparties to mitigate financial market volatility. Under its SEC consent order, the company enforces a formal review and certification process, a business risk and disclosure group and governance procedures to limit sales to direct customers based on expected demand, to escalate and resolve potential compliance issues, and to ensure continuity in its distribution channels by leveraging inventory management agreements and multiple estimation methods. Looking ahead, BMS will drive growth of key brands, execute new product launches, invest in its pipeline, focus on prioritized markets, maintain a culture of continuous improvement, and pursue strategic initiatives that reinforce its ability to absorb strain, preserve functioning and emerge stronger under challenging conditions.

Boeing emphasizes its ability to maintain operations and financial performance under a wide range of internal and external pressures by leveraging a diversified portfolio across commercial and defense businesses, supplying over multiple geographic regions through an extensive network of international partners, key suppliers and subcontractors, and by actively monitoring geopolitical, economic and regulatory developments—including political unrest in Russia and Ukraine, fuel price volatility, credit market shocks, natural disasters, conflicts and changing environmental regulations—that could disrupt production or deliveries.  The Company’s strategy of offsetting the cyclicality of its commercial and defense markets, maintaining substantial borrowing capacity and backup liquidity through revolving credit facilities and a commercial paper program, and securing selective financing solutions for customers through Boeing Capital, supports business continuity and flexibility in resource allocation.  Boeing applies rigorous program and contract accounting methodologies, including regular reassessment of cost, revenue and production‐quantity estimates, to anticipate and address risks of schedule delays, cost overruns or reach-forward losses, and implements mitigation plans and cost-reduction efforts to improve profitability and preserve performance across key programs such as the 737, 787 and KC-46A tanker.  Continuous investment in research and development, capital expenditures to expand production rates, active backlog management and disciplined pension and benefit funding further underpin the Company’s resilience, enabling it to absorb strain, adapt to unexpected challenges, reconfigure operations and sustain the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

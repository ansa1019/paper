Amgen’s MD&A outlines a range of strategies and initiatives that support organizational resilience by emphasizing discovery and development of innovative medicines to address serious illnesses, global expansion into new geographic growth markets, next-generation manufacturing of high-quality biologics and improved biologic drug delivery systems, thereby maintaining performance under external pressures such as patent expirations, competitive biosimilar launches, regulatory scrutiny and pricing pressures. The company’s announcement of a restructuring plan to reduce staff by 3,500 to 4,000 and decrease its facilities footprint by approximately 23% by the end of 2015 demonstrates a resource reconfiguration to improve cost structure and reallocate resources to fund innovation and pipeline launches. Amgen is advancing key operational flexibility initiatives—including improved contracting and sourcing, rationalizing discretionary spending, greater use of shared services and optimizing R&D efficiency—and has completed facilities construction and entered the licensure process for a next-generation biomanufacturing facility in Singapore to increase productivity at lower capital costs and operating expenses. Through comprehensive risk mitigation and continuity management, the company maintains $27.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted investments, employs interest rate and cross-currency swap contracts to hedge financial exposures, holds a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility and manages global receivables to offset the impacts of economic variability and payment delays by government healthcare providers, all of which preserve system integrity and operational continuity in the face of environmental disruptions. These financing, liquidity and hedging practices, combined with disciplined tax strategies and sustained investments in discovery research, later-stage clinical programs and marketed product support, enable Amgen to adapt, reconstitute trajectories of response and reconfigure resource deployment toward future growth opportunities while supporting performance maintenance and organizational health under challenging conditions.

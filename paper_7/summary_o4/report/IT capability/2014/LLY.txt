Following the loss of U.S. patent exclusivity for key products, the Company recognized restructuring charges—including severance costs under ongoing cost containment efforts to reduce its cost structure and global workforce and an asset impairment charge related to its decision to close and sell a manufacturing plant—to absorb strain and preserve operational continuity. It manages portfolio risk and developmental integrity through broad‐based R&D resource allocation—“a delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total R&D spending”—and contingent milestone and royalty arrangements that provide discretionary reconfiguration of commitments under adverse conditions. Liquidity resilience is secured by proactive debt management, access to commercial paper markets deemed adequate to fund short‐term borrowing needs, and a controlled risk management program using derivative instruments to hedge interest rate and foreign currency exposures. Sales return, rebate, and discount reserves are continuously adjusted for inventory fluctuations and evolving pricing pressures to maintain net revenue integrity amid market uncertainties. The strategic acquisition of Novartis Animal Health enhances global commercial presence, expands manufacturing and R&D capacity, and diversifies the product portfolio, thereby strengthening the Company’s ability to respond to external disturbances. Robust internal controls over critical accounting estimates—including product litigation liabilities, pension and retiree health benefit assumptions, and uncertain tax positions—support financial integrity, while forward‐looking guidance on revenue, gross margin, expense, and capital expenditures reflects a commitment to sustaining performance and adaptability in a volatile pharmaceutical environment.

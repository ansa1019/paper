Management explains that it continues to monitor the impact of volatility and uncertainty and seeks to manage its costs in order to respond to changing conditions, deploying skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis and proactively planning and managing the size and composition of its workforce to address changes in anticipated demand for services, thereby supporting the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The Company evaluates voluntary attrition, adjusts levels of new hiring and uses involuntary terminations to keep its supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand, adjusts compensation in certain skill sets and geographies to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees and strives to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on gross margin. It seeks to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues by using currency protection provisions in customer contracts and hedging programs and continuously reviews and reassesses estimates of contract profitability, recording loss provisions when necessary. For outsourcing transitions, certain transition costs are deferred and expensed evenly over the period services are provided, with deferred amounts protected in the event of early termination and monitored regularly for impairment. The Company maintains revolving borrowing capacity for general working capital purposes and believes its available cash balances and expected cash flows will be sufficient to satisfy current and planned working capital and investment needs, thereby demonstrating its ability to absorb strain, reconfigure resources and preserve integrity and performance under internal and external disturbances.

Item 7’s discussion highlights that “sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by two factors that are beyond our control, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates … and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions” and concedes that “while we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private label items,” illustrating an adaptive response to external pressures. The report further observes that “as our warehouse base grows … the negative aspects of such growth, including lower initial operating profitability … and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are increasingly less significant relative to the results of our total operations,” indicating an ability to absorb strain and maintain functioning amid expansion. Recognizing its vulnerability to margin fluctuations, management explains that “because our business is operated on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the income statement, particularly gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income,” underscoring risk awareness and the importance of cost control. In support of continuity and future performance, the Company describes sustained “investment in modernizing our information systems,” a compensation philosophy “better than the industry average … to reduce employee turnover and enhance employee satisfaction,” and capital expenditures financed with “cash to be provided from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments,” reflecting strategic resource allocation and foresight. In the liquidity and capital resources section, it states that “management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future,” and outlines bank credit and letter-of-credit facilities with intent “to renew these facilities prior to their expiration,” demonstrating preparedness for funding disruptions. Lastly, accounting policies such as quarterly reviews for “indicators of other-than-temporary impairment” of investments, evaluation of “impairment of long-lived assets” upon changes in circumstances, inventory valuation adjustments under LIFO and shrink provisions, and self-insurance and actuarial estimation of liabilities collectively evidence systematic risk mitigation and the maintenance of performance under internal or external variations.

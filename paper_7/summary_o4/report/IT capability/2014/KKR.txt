KKR describes itself as a leading global investment firm that manages investments across multiple asset classes—including private equity, real assets, credit and hedge funds—by following a patient and disciplined investment approach, employing world-class people and driving growth and value creation in the assets it manages.  It invests its own capital alongside that of its fund investors, leverages its pre-eminent global platform for sourcing transactions, raising capital and carrying out capital markets activities, and has grown through the expansion of its geographical presence and entry into new areas such as energy, infrastructure and real estate, innovations in products and tailored client solutions.  These efforts build on its core principles and industry expertise to leverage intellectual capital and synergies, broaden its opportunity set, and maintain operational flexibility and business continuity under varying economic and financial conditions.  The firm uses committee-based oversight—investment committees for initial diligence, portfolio management committees for ongoing monitoring and a central risk committee for firmwide risk control—along with access to diversified liquidity sources such as management, monitoring, transaction and incentive fees, carried interest, investment income, balance sheet seed capital and credit facilities, to allocate resources, mitigate risks and adapt its strategies to market dislocations, interest-rate and currency fluctuations, commodity price declines, regulatory changes and other disruptions.  KKR’s balance sheet holdings, which include general partner interests, co-investments and consolidated CLOs, support resilience by providing capital to seed new strategies, fund operational needs and align interests with stakeholders.  With over 75% of its fee-paying assets under management locked up for eight years or more, KKR believes it has significant flexibility to grow investments and select exit opportunities, preserve and improve functioning under adversity, and deliver strong investment performance through a systemic, multifaceted approach to adaptation and positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

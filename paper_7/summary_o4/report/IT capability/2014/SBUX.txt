In fiscal 2014, Starbucks demonstrated organizational resilience through disciplined execution of growth initiatives and strategic responses to market pressures, including global comparable store sales growth driven by promotional strategy and product innovation, disciplined expansion of licensed and company-operated stores, store portfolio optimization initiatives shifting toward higher-margin licensed formats, and cost management programs that leveraged sales growth to improve operating margins across geographies. The Company actively managed commodity price risk via fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed coffee contracts and financial derivatives, and maintained a market price risk management policy that governs hedging of commodity, currency, equity and interest rate exposures to mitigate volatility and ensure business continuity. Liquidity and capital resources were maintained through diversified cash and investment portfolios, revolving credit facilities, commercial paper programs, and strategic debt issuances, enabling the timely funding of the $2.8 billion Kraft arbitration payment and the acquisition of Starbucks Japan, while preserving compliance with covenants. Robust cash flows from operations, working capital management, and disciplined deployment of dividends and share repurchases reinforced financial flexibility. Detailed critical accounting policies for asset impairment and tax provisions reflect systematic evaluation of asset recoverability and deferred tax asset realizability under changing economic and regulatory environments.

AbbVie’s strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results and returns for shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the longer term, reflected in 6 percent net sales growth to $20.0 billion, gross margin improvements driven by favorable product mix and operational efficiencies, and cash flows from operations of $3.5 billion, which enabled the company to continue to enhance its pipeline through licensing and collaboration activities, fund $2.7 billion in dividends, and repurchase 9 million shares for $550 million. To preserve and improve functioning despite internal and external variations, AbbVie secured regulatory approvals for its interferon-free HCV treatment Viekira Pak and Duopa, completed late-stage clinical trials, in-licensed duvelisib, entered into a novel collaboration with Calico, and plans further investment in emerging markets such as Brazil, China, and Russia to expand market share and presence in underserved markets. AbbVie also plans to drive Humira sales growth by expanding market share, pursuing additional indications, and identifying supply chain efficiencies to optimize residual value as products reach the end of exclusivity, thereby supporting operational continuity and strong operating margin. In transitioning from Abbott, the company entered into transition services agreements to receive information technology, financial, and administrative services, facilitating independent operations and the establishment of stand-alone back-office infrastructure internationally, while incurring non-recurring expenses to expand its organizational capabilities. The company monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers, and government regulations, establishes allowances against accounts receivable, and periodically utilizes factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk. AbbVie maintains sufficient liquidity to meet obligations and pursue strategic initiatives through cash on hand, operating cash flows, and a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility in compliance with covenants, as well as through its ability to issue commercial paper and long-term debt. Critical accounting policies, including revenue recognition, rebate accruals, pension assumptions, and impairment testing for goodwill and intangible assets, further support AbbVie’s capacity to anticipate, assess, and respond to pressures, constraints, and risks, thereby maintaining its integrity and performance under challenging conditions.

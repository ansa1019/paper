The company describes a range of ongoing strategic and operational measures designed to preserve and enhance its performance under shifting market, regulatory and economic pressures, including continual monitoring of global healthcare, macroeconomic and currency dynamics to align expenses with revenues while safeguarding investment in research and development, capital plant and talent; implementation of multi-year restructuring and process-improvement programs to reduce manufacturing costs, improve operational flexibility and free cash flow; disciplined liquidity and credit management—maintaining an investment-grade profile, significant cash generation from operations and access to a $2 billion revolving credit facility and term loan—to ensure continuity of funding for growth initiatives and contingencies; targeted acquisitions and divestitures to reconfigure the product portfolio, broaden geographic reach (particularly in emerging markets) and streamline focus on core franchises; careful provisioning for litigation, tax and product-liability exposures and dynamic reassessment of contingent consideration and intangible-asset values to mitigate legal, regulatory and financial risks; a formalized use of non-GAAP metrics (adjusting for amortization, impairment, restructuring and litigation charges) to assess underlying performance and support resilient decision-making; and strategic initiatives to launch next-generation technologies, expand commercialization infrastructure and optimize working capital—all reflecting the ability to absorb strain, adapt resource allocation and preserve or improve functioning in the face of foreign-exchange fluctuations, pricing pressures, litigation outcomes, healthcare policy reform and competitive challenges.

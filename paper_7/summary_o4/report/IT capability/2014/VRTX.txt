In the Management’s Discussion and Analysis, the Company highlights its organizational resilience by maintaining its financial strength while discovering, developing, manufacturing and commercializing transformative therapies for serious diseases; by pursuing research in diverse areas to balance the risks inherent in drug development and sustain a robust pipeline; by instituting a corporate compliance program to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through policies, systems and a culture of compliance; by dedicating substantial management and other resources to secure and maintain appropriate reimbursement from government and private payors worldwide, acknowledging that such negotiations may take significant time; by closely monitoring discovery, research, clinical and nonclinical studies and frequently evaluating its programs in light of new data and business and commercial insights—a process that can result in abrupt changes in focus and priorities; by adapting resource deployment in response to adverse or varying interpretations of nonclinical and clinical data, potential regulatory delays or market dynamics; by relying on existing cash, product revenues, collaborative agreements and a credit facility to support liquidity while managing negative covenants that may limit additional financing; by restructuring operations through headcount reductions, intangible asset impairments and the relocation of its corporate headquarters—estimating related lease obligations using probability-weighted discounted cash flows and reviewing these estimates quarterly; by rigorously estimating rebates, chargebacks and discounts based on evolving payor mix data; by evaluating inventory capitalization and write-downs through recoverability assessments; by testing intangible assets for impairment annually and on the occurrence of triggering events; and by applying significant judgment in revenue recognition, research accruals, lease accounting and variable-interest-entity consolidation in order to preserve the integrity and performance of its system under evolving regulatory, financial and operational pressures.

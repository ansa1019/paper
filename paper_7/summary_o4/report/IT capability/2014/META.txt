Management’s discussion and analysis discloses various strategies and processes that enable the company to absorb internal and external variations and preserve performance, including regular evaluation and adjustment of critical accounting assumptions and estimates, proactive provisioning for loss contingencies and uncertain tax positions with quarterly reviews and adjustments, and dynamic resource allocation across data center infrastructure, technical capacity and workforce investments to support user growth, increased engagement and new products.  The Company reversed $34 million of data-center lease abandonment expense in 2014 when it re-occupied a previously exited facility and recognized $117 million in 2013 when exiting leased data centers, demonstrating its ability to reconfigure and redeploy facilities in response to changing operational requirements.  A $6.5 billion revolving credit facility, together with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $11.20 billion as of December 31, 2014, underpins its business continuity planning and liquidity management, and management anticipates that available funds, credit facilities and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet operational cash needs for the foreseeable future.  The Company’s revenue recognition policies, application of principal-versus-agent judgments, annual and event-driven goodwill and intangible-asset impairment assessments, and capital expenditure plans of $2.8 billion to $3.2 billion for 2015 reflect a systemic perspective on risk mitigation, adaptation and performance maintenance under evolving market, technological and regulatory pressures.

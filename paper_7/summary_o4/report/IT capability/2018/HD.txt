The Company’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis describes a range of capabilities and processes that underpin its ability to maintain operations and adapt under internal or external pressures, noting that its cash position, access to long-term debt markets, committed $3.0 billion commercial paper programs and cash flow from operations should be sufficient to support operating requirements, capital expenditures, dividend and share repurchase programs and debt service for several years, with alternative financing sources available. It details quarterly evaluations for impairment of long-lived assets at the store level—triggered by indicators such as sustained losses, store closures or changing circumstances—and based on multi-year cash flow projections that incorporate sales, margin, competitive and economic assumptions, with impairments measured at fair value where carrying amounts exceed undiscounted recoverable amounts. The Company identifies operating cash flow as a primary liquidity source, reporting increases in fiscal 2018 and 2017 driven by higher net earnings, favorable effective tax rates and comparable sales performance, partially offset by working capital movements; it manages inventory under a retail method with markups, markdowns and shrink estimates, accrues vendor allowances over incentive periods, defers revenue and recognizes related return assets for unearned customer payments, and reviews those estimates each reporting period. Risk mitigation includes self-insurance retentions for general, workers’ compensation and employee medical liabilities subject to actuarial review, use of derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency and interest rate exposures, maintenance of back-up credit facilities, and contractual commitments spanning debt, leases, purchase obligations and unrecognized tax benefits. The MD&A also highlights strategic adaptations such as the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 for revenue recognition, incremental investments in interconnected physical and digital experiences, expense control, hurricane-related response in fiscal 2017, share repurchase authorizations and dividend increases, all of which contribute to the firm’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or enhance performance across varying conditions.

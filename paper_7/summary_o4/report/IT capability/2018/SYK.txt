Throughout 2018 the company maintained its resilience by generating substantial operating cash flow ($2.6 billion) to support ongoing operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions and return of capital to shareholders, executing a capital allocation strategy prioritizing acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases, and by issuing €2.25 billion of senior unsecured notes while repaying higher‐cost debt and preserving borrowing capacity under a $1.5 billion credit facility and a $1.5 billion commercial paper program. It adapted its financial reporting by adopting ASC 606 on a modified retrospective basis and by supplementing GAAP results with non-GAAP measures to exclude the effects of acquisitions, currency translation, restructuring, regulatory and recall-related charges, thereby providing a more stable view of underlying performance. The company absorbed external variations such as currency fluctuations, hurricanes, regulatory requirements and recall events by recording reserves for inventory obsolescence, product liability and uncertain tax positions, by investing in quality system updates and by recognizing acquisition-related intangible amortization and restructuring charges as they occurred. Its liquidity management strategy, which considers global economic factors and tax planning opportunities—including a $1.5 billion deferred tax asset from an intercompany IP transfer—ensured that current assets exceeded current liabilities by $4.9 billion. Moreover, management’s ongoing impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles and its maintenance of strong investment-grade debt ratings reinforced the firm’s ability to preserve and enhance functioning under challenging conditions and to emerge stronger from adverse events.

Management’s discussion includes forward-looking statements regarding risks and uncertainties and refers to risk factor disclosures that could cause actual results and timing of certain events to differ materially. The company continues to invest in the development of its services, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth, delivers software via an easy-to-use, consumer-product interface that can be easily configured and rapidly deployed, and supports regulatory or security-driven internal or third-party hosting. Subscription services include ordered service access and related support and updates over the term, with annual advance billing for subscriptions and monthly arrears billing for professional services, enabling alignment of cash flows with service delivery. It expects total backlog and billings to fluctuate due to timing, duration and size of contracts, the mix of cloud and self-hosted offerings, and foreign currency movements, and has initiated a limited hedging program using short-term currency derivatives to hedge a portion of net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities. Liquidity sources—cash, cash equivalents, and operating cash flows—are anticipated to be sufficient to meet obligations, including convertible note repayments, data center expansions, lease commitments, headcount growth, and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months. This strategic allocation of resources, flexible deployment models, financial hedges and forward-looking disclosures support the company’s ability to absorb strain, adapt to environmental perturbations and maintain integrity and performance under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

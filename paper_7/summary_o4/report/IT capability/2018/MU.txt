We continuously evaluate alternatives for efficiently funding our capital expenditures and ongoing operations, maintaining business continuity and operational flexibility by expecting that our cash and investments, cash flows from operations, and available financing—including an undrawn $2.00 billion revolving credit facility—will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through the next twelve months. To develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we plan capital expenditures of $10.5 billion in fiscal 2019, focused on technology transitions and product enablement, and we periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment—such as extending DRAM equipment lives from five to seven years in response to longer node transition cycles and increased reuse—to reduce depreciation expense and adapt to industry trends. We share the cost of certain product and process development activities under development agreements with Intel to jointly develop NAND and 3D XPoint technologies through the third generation and have agreed to independently develop subsequent generations to better optimize the technology for our respective business needs, reflecting resource reconfiguration, inter-organizational collaboration, and strategic agility. Our liquidity and capital resources strategy includes debt prepayments and repurchases—$9.42 billion in fiscal 2018—balanced by equity issuances and proceeds from member debt to preserve system resilience under financial pressures. We mitigate credit risk by investing primarily in money market funds and liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities through high-credit-quality financial institutions and limit single-obligor concentrations, and we hold $1.71 billion of cash and marketable investments in foreign subsidiaries considered indefinitely reinvested, managing repatriation and withholding tax obligations under new U.S. tax legislation to safeguard our system integrity. We conduct rigorous critical accounting estimates—assessing contingencies, goodwill and intangible-asset impairments, inventory net realizable values, and contractual obligations—to identify and mitigate risks arising from environmental disruptions, thereby preserving functionality and firm performance under challenging conditions.

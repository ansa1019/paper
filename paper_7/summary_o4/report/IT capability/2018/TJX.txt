Management’s discussion emphasizes that all forward-looking statements are informed by the company’s assessment of risks and uncertainties, including those disclosed in Item 1A, and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions, underscoring TJX’s commitment to proactive risk assessment and future orientation. In response to Brexit, the U.K.’s decision to leave the EU, TJX Europe’s management evaluated a range of possible outcomes, identified areas of concern and implemented strategies to mitigate them, including the development of a plan to realign its European supply chain, the establishment of dedicated resources and systems to support that plan, and ongoing communication with associates regarding additional procedures required post-Brexit, with the expectation that these steps will reduce operational risks and enable the company to further adapt should a comprehensive withdrawal agreement not be reached. To manage foreign currency volatility on merchandise purchases, TJX routinely enters into inventory-related hedging instruments, records mark-to-market gains or losses at each reporting period, and effectively offsets these impacts when the hedged inventory is received and paid for, thereby mitigating earnings volatility and preserving operating margins. The company continues to invest in its distribution network—reflected in higher supply chain costs driven by the opening and enhancement of distribution centers—and plans approximately $1.5 billion of capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 for offices, distribution centers (including buying, merchandising and information systems), store renovations and new stores, all funded through internally generated cash, in order to bolster operational flexibility, resource allocation and continuity of business operations under varying external pressures. Additionally, TJX maintains cash and cash equivalents of $3 billion, supplemented by credit facilities, to meet operating needs and support resilience in the face of unexpected market developments.

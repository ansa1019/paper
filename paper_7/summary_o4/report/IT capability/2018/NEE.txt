In 2018 and 2017, the company pursued targeted capital deployments—including ongoing investments in plant in service, renewable generation additions and transmission and distribution enhancements—to ensure reliable service under both nominal and extreme conditions, and it strategically used reserve amortization under its rate agreements to absorb and partially offset hurricane-Irma storm restoration costs while reinstating those reserves over the term of the rate plan, thereby preserving operational continuity and regulatory return; it maintained robust liquidity and capital resources through diversified funding sources—cash flows from operations, commercial paper, revolving credit facilities, long-term debt issuances, membership interest investments and asset sales—to support working capital, capital expenditures, debt maturities and acquisitions, and it safeguarded credit-rating levels to avoid collateral posting triggers; the firm employs comprehensive risk mitigation practices, including energy, interest-rate and foreign-currency derivative contracts, master netting arrangements, collateral requirements and value-at-risk modeling, to measure and manage exposures in commodity markets, interest rates and equity securities; it records regulatory assets and liabilities for probable future cost recovery or refund under its cost-based rate regulation framework, accrues and funds nuclear decommissioning and asset‐retirement obligations based on approved studies and inflation assumptions to maintain system integrity, and applies critical accounting judgments in fair-value measurement, pension funding and impairment testing to absorb strain and preserve performance; strategic organizational changes such as the deconsolidation of a joint venture generated significant investment gains, simplified financial structure and reconfigured the company’s growth trajectory, while governance measures—including debt covenants, separate-return tax calculations, adjusted earnings metrics for performance‐based compensation and active management of contractual obligations—underscore the company’s ability to adapt to regulatory, market and environmental disruptions, deploy resources flexibly and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

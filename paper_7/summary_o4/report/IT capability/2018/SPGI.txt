S&P Global’s MD&A describes a multifaceted approach to preserving positive adjustment under challenging conditions by deliberately allocating economic resources, reconfiguring its portfolio, and reinforcing operational, technological and cultural capabilities.  The company has executed disciplined acquisitions (such as Kensho, Panjiva and Ratewatch) and divestitures (including SPSE/CMA, Equity Research and J.D. Power) to absorb market strain, reconstitute its business mix and generate financial resources, while retooling its organizational structure—evidenced by new reportable segments—to improve decision-making agility and performance under pressure.  It pursues operational flexibility and resilience through continuous investment in core management systems, enterprise-wide data strategies and machine learning, transformation of its technology infrastructure to mitigate cyber and other risks, standardization of processes to reduce complexity, and enhancement of its robust risk, internal control and compliance culture.  Strategic initiatives in finance focus on delivering revenue growth, margin targets and returns to shareholders while creating capacity for long-term investments; customer initiatives center on delivering a modern, integrated digital platform and expanding into high-potential geographies; operations initiatives include improving prioritization, agility and cost efficiency; and people initiatives aim to build an inclusive, performance-driven culture that attracts, retains and develops best-in-class talent.  The company’s liquidity and capital resources strategy—anchored by strong cash flows from operations, an undrawn revolving credit facility and targeted share repurchases and dividends—further strengthens its ability to absorb external disturbances and sustain integrity and performance in nominal and extreme conditions.

As discussed in the section entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” Booking Holdings’ management acknowledges that its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under challenging conditions depends upon navigating numerous risks and uncertainties described under “Risk Factors,” including macroeconomic volatility, political events such as Brexit, regulatory investigations, technological developments, competitive pressures, currency fluctuations, natural disasters, health crises and other unpredictable disruptions that can dramatically affect travel demand. To maintain positive adjustment under such conditions, the company continuously allocates resources to expand and diversify its accommodation offerings—including higher-risk alternative properties—enhance consumer experience through ongoing innovation in desktop, mobile and payment platforms, and invest in brand and performance marketing, technology, and personnel to support global growth and operational flexibility. Booking Holdings actively manages foreign-currency and interest-rate risks through hedging and cash-pooling structures, regularly reviews deferred tax assets and goodwill for potential impairments, and adapts its merchant and agency models—recognizing shifts in booking windows, seasonality and cancellation rates—to preserve margins and cash flow timing. The company also leverages a revolving credit facility, pursues strategic acquisitions and alliances, and maintains a systemic perspective on business continuity, change management and long-term profitability in a turbulent, fragmented and rapidly evolving marketplace.

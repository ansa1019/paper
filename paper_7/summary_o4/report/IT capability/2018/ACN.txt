The company notes that it continuously monitors significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty across markets and seeks to manage its costs in order to respond to changing conditions, using currency protection provisions in customer contracts and hedging programs to manage foreign exchange exposure, restating results “in local currency” to facilitate period-to-period comparisons and estimating the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on revenue growth, and further projects that U.S. dollar revenue growth may differ from local currency growth based on recent exchange rate ranges. It proactively plans and manages the size and composition of its workforce—hiring to meet current and projected demand, evaluating voluntary attrition, adjusting levels of new hiring, using involuntary terminations where necessary, adjusting compensation in certain geographies and skill sets, and seeking to deploy its employees globally on a timely basis—to keep its supply of skills and resources in balance with client needs and to reduce the impact of compensation increases on gross margin. The company recognizes revenues and revises estimates of contract profitability on an ongoing basis, records loss provisions promptly when contract losses are probable, defers and amortizes transition costs for outsourcing arrangements subject to impairment review, and allocates revenues for multiple-deliverable arrangements based on standalone selling prices, thereby preserving performance integrity under varying contract scopes and cost-revenue dynamics. It implements cost-management actions across sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses, evaluates its estimated annual effective tax rate to address changes in tax law and deferred tax assets, and establishes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a “more likely than not” threshold, all reflecting a systemic approach to maintaining integrity and performance under internal and external pressures.

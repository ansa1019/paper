During the last six months of fiscal 2018, the Company undertook a comprehensive strategic reassessment of the business, established a new leadership team, and developed action plans to improve operational performance and customer experience, including sharpened focus on retail fundamentals, alignment of leadership to accelerate decision-making and execution, portfolio concentration on its core home improvement operations, rationalization of store inventory to remove clutter and reduce lower-performing SKUs, and targeted investments in top-selling items for its professional customer; it also committed to exit or restructure under-performing and non-core activities—including all Orchard Supply Hardware locations, selected U.S., Canadian and Mexican store closures, and certain service offerings—and recorded a $952 million goodwill impairment related to its Canadian business in response to a softening housing market. These adaptive measures were complemented by strategic initiatives focused on delivering merchandising excellence—placing the right products in the right place at the right time—transforming the supply chain through advancement of fulfillment and delivery capabilities, simplifying store operations to improve in-stock execution, and intensifying customer engagement with professional customers, all supported by disciplined resource allocation of $1.2 billion in capital expenditures, $6.2 billion of operating cash flow, ongoing share repurchases, dividend payments and committed credit facilities, thereby preserving liquidity, maintaining continuity of operations, mitigating external pressures, and positioning the organization to absorb strain and sustain or improve performance under challenging conditions.

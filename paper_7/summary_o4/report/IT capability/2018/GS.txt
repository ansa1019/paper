Goldman Sachs has established a comprehensive resilience framework that focuses on maintaining integrity and performance under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions by pre‐funding global core liquid assets, maintaining diversified and appropriately tenored funding sources, and holding capital and liquidity buffers across its parent, funding intermediary and regulated subsidiaries.  The firm’s dynamic balance‐sheet planning and asset‐liability management processes combine projected asset needs with stress‐tested funding plans approved by senior committees, while contingency funding and capital plans identify potential cash and collateral outflows, analyze drivers of a capital deficiency and prescribe mitigation actions, governance protocols and communication procedures for crisis response and recovery.  Ongoing semi‐annual CCAR and DFAST stress tests and internally developed severely adverse scenarios, along with liquidity coverage and net stable funding ratio monitoring, inform decisions on capital distributions, debt issuance and the design of triggers and alerts used to gauge the timing of potential resolutions or bankruptcy filings.  A multilayered risk governance structure—including the firmwide enterprise risk, risk governance, conduct and operational risk, model risk control and client and business standards committees—oversees business continuity, information security, resolution planning, model validation, control self‐assessments and scenario analyses that address market, credit, liquidity and operational risks, ensuring that material exposures are identified, quantified and held within limits consistent with the firm’s risk appetite.  In parallel, active trading‐desk measures such as value‐at‐risk, stress tests, sensitivities, credit limits, collateral management and economic hedges, supported by comprehensive model inventory and validation processes, enable agile adaptation to market disruptions, regulatory reforms (e.g., LIBOR transition, Brexit), external pressures and evolving client needs.  Through these mechanisms—ranging from capital attribution and subsidiary funding policies to resolution capital adequacy models and recovery planning—Goldman Sachs seeks to absorb strain, mitigate errors and resource constraints, and reconfigure trajectories toward a stronger future, thereby underscoring its ability to foresee, confront and benefit from sudden disruptive change while preserving positive adjustment and business continuity.

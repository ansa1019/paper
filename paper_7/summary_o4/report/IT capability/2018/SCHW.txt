Schwab has adopted a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework that emphasizes risk identification, measurement, monitoring and mitigation through a board-approved risk appetite, a global risk committee and functional sub-committees for compliance, financial, operational, new products and incentive compensation risks, with business units held accountable for implementing policies and procedures and supported by compliance, finance, internal audit, legal and corporate risk management.  The company acknowledges that “operations are highly dependent on the integrity and resilience of our critical business functions and technology systems,” and “to minimize business interruptions and ensure the capacity to continue operations during an incident regardless of duration,” it maintains “a backup and recovery infrastructure which includes facilities for backup and communications, a geographically dispersed workforce, and routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans and a well-established incident management program.”  Information security risk is managed through an integrated program that “knits together complementary tools, controls and technologies to protect systems, client accounts and data,” limits employee access to non-public information, enforces internal authentication and continuously monitors for and responds to cyber threats.  Third-party risk is governed through contractual provisions, control standards, performance monitoring and testing to promote resiliency of outsourced technology, processing and support functions.  The firm conducts regular stress testing of net interest revenue using simulation models of all interest-sensitive assets and liabilities, monitors key risk metrics against pre-set limits and requires escalation and remediation should any thresholds be breached.  To sustain liquidity under both normal and stressed conditions, Schwab maintains diversified funding sources—including high-quality liquid assets covering projected cash outflows under a modified Liquidity Coverage Ratio framework, committed and uncommitted credit facilities, Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve discount window access—and conducts periodic liquidity stress tests and contingency funding planning.  Capital resilience is supported by ongoing capital forecasts, early warning indicators, comprehensive stress testing of adverse macroeconomic and firm-specific scenarios, a capital contingency plan for low-probability/high-impact events and internal guidelines to hold capital well above regulatory minimums, with support to subsidiaries via dividends, equity infusions or subordinated loans to absorb unexpected losses and preserve organizational integrity and performance under pressure.

The company is leading a transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smoke-free future and ultimately replace cigarettes with smoke-free products to the benefit of adult consumers, society, the company and its shareholders, reflecting an adaptive strategic initiative in response to shifting regulatory and consumer environments. Through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation, the company aims to ensure that its smoke-free products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements, demonstrating its commitment to maintain system integrity and performance under evolving nominal and regulatory variations. To provide a greater focus on both combustible and reduced-risk products and support its transformation toward a smoke-free future, effective January 1, 2018, the company began managing its business in six reportable segments—European Union, Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa, South & Southeast Asia, East Asia & Australia, and Latin America & Canada—enhancing operational flexibility and resource deployment across diverse markets. The company’s net revenues and operating income are affected by various external pressures—including product volume and mix, pricing variances and currency exchange rate fluctuations—and the unfavorable currency impact in 2018 resulting from fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against key currencies materially affected profitability across primary revenue markets and local cost bases, underscoring its risk assessment and response strategies. Ongoing efforts to optimize capital structure, such as using existing cash to repay the $2.5 billion principal of its matured May 2018 ten-year U.S. bond, demonstrate proactive resource reconfiguration and risk mitigation. In response to evolving accounting requirements, the company retrospectively adopted ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” across all prior periods and elected to present revenues net of excise taxes, reinforcing its compliance mechanisms and adaptability under changing regulatory constraints. During the fourth quarter of 2018, updates to provisional estimates of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act were recorded in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, including a current income tax charge of $185 million and a deferred tax benefit of $154 million, reflecting dynamic tax planning and future orientation. The company estimates its 2019 effective tax rate will be approximately 23%, based on current analysis and interpretations, further illustrating its forward-looking planning and continuity of performance in the face of legislative fluctuations. As a holding company, principal sources of funds—dividends and debt repayments from wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries—support its financial resource management and operational continuity, contributing to the maintenance of performance and organizational health under varying internal and external conditions.

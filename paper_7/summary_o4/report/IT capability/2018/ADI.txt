In fiscal 2018, we completed the acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation, financed through existing cash on hand, net proceeds from bridge and term loan facilities and proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes, and we prospectively integrated Linearâ€™s operations and replaced outstanding equity awards held by its employees, reflecting our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite large-scale organizational change. We monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues, which in fiscal 2018 led to the consolidation of certain wafer and test facility operations, closure plans for the Hillview wafer fabrication facility and the Singapore test facility, the transfer of production to internal facilities and external foundries, and related severance and benefit arrangements expected to yield annual savings of approximately $60.0 million. We defer revenue and related cost of sales on shipments to certain distributors until resale to end customers to capture end-user demand patterns, and as our data systems evolve we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods to maintain the integrity of our reporting system. Our research and development efforts increased by 20% in fiscal 2018, reflecting our continued commitment to develop innovative technologies and processes to maintain product leadership and provide new product offerings, which we view as critical to future growth. We maintain principal sources of liquidity in cash and cash equivalents and have entered into and repaid bridge credit and term loan facilities, and our $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility provides additional financial flexibility for operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions and dividends. Our capital allocation processes include the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program in connection with the acquisition and its subsequent reinstatement, under which we repurchased 148.9 million shares for approximately $5.6 billion, demonstrating adaptability in our strategic initiatives. We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately 4% of fiscal 2019 revenue, to be funded with cash on hand and cash generated from operations, while our debt covenants have been maintained in compliance as of November 3, 2018. The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance will require significant adjustments to deferred tax balances, transition tax payments over eight years, and changes in revenue and cost deferral practices, yet we are approaching the final stage of our implementation plan and have made reasonable estimates of these effects. Our business continuity and system integrity are further supported by enhancements in operational spending management, variable compensation structures linked to profitability and revenue growth, and the ongoing review of critical accounting policies, including inventory valuation, long-lived asset impairment, goodwill testing, contingent consideration and uncertain tax positions, to ensure an effective strategic response to both nominal and exceptional conditions.

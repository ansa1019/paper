KKR discloses that as a global investment firm it is materially affected by financial and economic conditions worldwide, recognizing that global and regional market volatility, credit dislocations and regulatory changes can both impair investment valuations, capital-raising and financing costs and, conversely, create opportunities to invest at reduced valuations and position the firm for future growth. Management monitors key macroeconomic indicators—GDP growth, inflation, unemployment, interest-rate policy and political uncertainty—to assess and mitigate risks to its private and public markets portfolios, while employing hedging techniques to manage currency exposure and preserve performance under pressure. The firm emphasizes operational flexibility in deploying and syndicating capital across private equity, real assets, credit and capital-markets strategies, adapting fee bases and investment horizons as funds enter or exit their investment periods, and utilizing alternative exit channels such as strategic sales and public offerings. Liquidity planning anticipates cash needs for fund commitments, co-investments, underwriting and syndication obligations, debt service and corporate expenditures, relying on diversified sources including operating cash flows, carried-interest realizations, interest and dividend income, and access to revolving credit facilities and debt issuances. KKR’s dividend policy, share-repurchase program and tax receivable agreement obligations are managed under board-approved thresholds and performance metrics, reflecting a strategic, forward-looking resource allocation framework designed to preserve integrity and performance despite environmental perturbations and market uncertainty.

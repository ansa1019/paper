Management reported that “operating fundamentals remained strong for our O&M portfolio” with occupancy at 97.5% and “no signs of slowness based on our operating metrics,” while acknowledging “market volatility caused by current trade and tariff disputes and uncertainty with regard to the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union” and committing to “continue to be prudent in running our business.” In response to external pressures, the Company reconfigured its capital structure through the DCT transaction, repaying $1.8 billion of assumed debt and issuing new senior notes—“extending our debt maturities to 76 months and lowering our effective interest rate to 2.7%”—and disposed of non-strategic assets, generating approximately $14 billion in proceeds to focus on “the highest-quality properties in the best markets.” Contributions to unconsolidated co-investment ventures and property dispositions produced net proceeds of $2.8 billion and net gains of $841 million, and at year-end the portfolio had vacancies at “historic lows,” strong customer and investor demand, record-long lease terms and a “strong balance sheet,” reflecting preserved performance under adverse conditions. The Company manages liquidity and resource deployment through diversified funding sources—unrestricted cash balances, net cash flow from property operations, fees and promotes from co-investment ventures, property dispositions, equity and debt issuances, and a $3.9 billion global credit facility—and evaluates its ongoing operations via segment NOI and same-store metrics, excluding foreign currency effects, while employing net-investment hedges on foreign-currency debt to mitigate currency risk and maintain continuity of operations.

In its discussion, Apple emphasizes risk mitigation and continuity by disclosing that its “forward‐looking statements” involve “risks and uncertainties” that could materially affect operations and that its financial management—including investment policies requiring “investment grade” securities to “minimize the potential risk of principal loss,” regular portfolio impairment reviews, and a strategy to fund operations, share repurchases and dividends from current cash and ongoing operating activities—supports its ability to respond to environmental disruptions. The company states it “believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months” and plans to pay its deemed repatriation tax in installments “in accordance with the Act,” illustrating adaptability to regulatory changes. Apple manages supply‐chain variability by performing regular reviews of “inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels and component cost trends,” reviews manufacturing‐related capital assets for impairment when events indicate potential non‐recoverability and accrues for purchase commitment cancellation fees to mitigate abrupt declines in demand. The company’s forecasting of gross margin pressures—citing “continued industry‐wide global product pricing pressures,” “increased competition,” “compressed product life cycles” and foreign currency fluctuations—and its plan to adopt new accounting standards using modified retrospective transition methods reflect a systemic perspective on maintaining operational flexibility and preserving performance under challenging conditions, consistent with organizational resilience as the maintenance of positive adjustment under adversity.

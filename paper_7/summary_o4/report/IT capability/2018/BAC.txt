Bank of America has proactively bolstered its organizational resilience by adapting its operating model to emerging challenges—most notably preparing for the U.K.’s exit from the European Union by relocating key banking and broker-dealer operations outside the U.K. to “continue to service our clients with minimal disruption, retain operational flexibility, minimize transition risks and maximize legal entity efficiencies.” An enterprise-wide initiative has been established to identify, assess and monitor risks associated with the discontinuation of LIBOR and other benchmarks, updating operational processes, models and contractual mechanics, and engaging with global regulators and industry working groups to develop transition strategies. The corporation maintains a substantial buffer of unencumbered cash and high-quality liquid securities, regularly conducts liquidity stress analyses—testing deposit run-off, contingent collateral calls and other potential outflows under adverse scenarios—and maintains robust contingency funding and recovery plans that include asset sales, business divestitures, debt issuances and de-risking strategies. A comprehensive risk framework, overseen by executive risk committees and an independent risk management function, embeds a systematic Identify, Measure, Monitor and Control process supported by a formal risk appetite statement, capital planning, capital contingency planning and resolution planning to preserve safety and soundness even under stress. Interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives are employed to hedge the variability in cash flows and fair values of assets, liabilities and net investments in non-U.S. operations, with cash flow hedge gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified as earnings over the hedged period. Mortgage origination and servicing risks are hedged through combined economic-hedge portfolios of interest-rate lock commitments, loans held-for-sale, mortgage servicing rights and derivative instruments to mitigate mismatches and prepayment variability. These measures, together with regular enterprise-wide stress testing and the ongoing refinement of processes and controls, demonstrate the bank’s ability to absorb strain, maintain functional performance and preserve continuity in the face of internal and external disruptions.

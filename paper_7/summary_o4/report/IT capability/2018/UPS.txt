In 2018, UPS recorded $360 million of pre-tax transformation strategy costs associated with its multi-year network modernization and technology investment program, reflecting planned organizational change and short-term trade-offs to strengthen long-term performance. Management supplements GAAP results with adjusted financial measures—including adjusted operating profit, currency-neutral revenue and revenue per piece—to guide resource allocation, incentive compensation, business unit performance analysis and strategic decision-making, thereby enhancing operational flexibility and mitigating external pressures such as currency fluctuations and fuel price volatility. The company continually reconfigures its integrated air and ground networks to match higher volume levels, expands capacity through facility automation projects and additional aircraft leases, implements Saturday ground operations in major metropolitan areas, and applies peak surcharges to offset incremental costs during significant volume surges—actions that illustrate service innovation, risk mitigation, future orientation and the maintenance of performance under exceptional demand conditions. Activity-based costing refinements optimize expense allocation across reporting segments, while currency and fuel hedging programs further ensure business continuity and systemic integrity under environmental perturbations. Capital expenditures in buildings, plant equipment, vehicles and information technology embody strategic foresight and resource reconfiguration designed to preserve and improve functioning amid unexpected situations, consistent with a trajectory model of anticipating, responding to and emerging stronger from disruptive events.

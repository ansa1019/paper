Gilead’s management discussion describes a sustained focus on operational excellence and financial discipline to preserve and strengthen the company’s functioning under shifting market conditions, including the deployment of hedging strategies to mitigate foreign‐currency risks and the adjustment of inventory reserves by $440 million to respond to lower demand for certain hepatitis C products.  The company has positioned itself for future growth through a balanced mix of internal discovery and clinical development, product acquisitions, in-licensing and strategic collaborations with academic and industry partners, thereby allocating resources and knowledge across multiple platforms to absorb strain and maintain performance.  In 2018 alone, Gilead invested in 119 active clinical studies, entered into 26 collaborations or strategic investments to access new technologies, and authorized the launch of authorized generic versions of Epclusa® and Harvoni® through its subsidiary Asegua to reduce disruption and expand patient access.  Leadership transitions and planned successions further reinforce organizational health and continuity, while diversified debt and credit facilities, a capital return program of dividends and share repurchases, and the maintenance of over $31 billion in cash and marketable securities ensure adequate capital resources to respond effectively to environmental perturbations and strategic opportunities.

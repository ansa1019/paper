While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private label items, and through our online offerings. Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices and to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” on quality goods—consistently providing the most competitive values rather than focusing on short-term price maximization. Our financial performance depends heavily on our ability to control costs, and with respect to expenses relating to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits but instead to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through, in order to reduce employee turnover and enhance employee satisfaction. We believe that our gasoline business draws members but generally has a significantly lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business, and we manage the impact of rapidly changing gasoline prices on net sales growth and gross margin percentage to leverage operational efficiency. Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada, and other international operating segments, while certain countries in the other international segment exhibit higher rates of square footage growth, lower wages and benefits costs as a percentage of country sales, and/or less or no direct membership warehouse competition, reflecting our flexibility to adapt to local market conditions. Management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future, supported by primary capital requirements for new and remodeled warehouses, information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations, and working capital. Net cash provided by operating activities is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees, while net cash used in investing activities is primarily related to capital expenditures, with 2018 spending of $2,969 and an intention to spend approximately $2,800 to $3,100 during fiscal 2019 financed with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. The company is predominantly self-insured for employee health-care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle liability, and inventory loss, maintaining insurance coverage in certain instances to limit exposure arising from catastrophic events and estimating retained liabilities using historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes with borrowing capacity of $857 at September 2, 2018, letter of credit facilities totaling $220, and contractual obligations for merchandise purchase orders, long-term debt, operating leases, construction and land obligations, capital lease obligations, equipment and service purchase commitments, and other obligations, all reflecting our structured approach to risk management, resource allocation, and continuity of operations.

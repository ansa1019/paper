The company’s approach to maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions encompasses augmenting internal growth through complementary acquisitions across its four global business segments, deploying targeted strategic growth investments—such as expanding geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, enhanced service and operational infrastructure and focused research projects—to adapt to evolving customer needs, and driving productivity improvements via its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, global sourcing initiatives, headcount reductions, facility consolidations and low-cost region manufacturing to absorb cost pressures and preserve performance. Rigorous restructuring actions, including severance, facility abandonments and streamlining of operations, are expected to yield material annual cost savings beginning in part in 2018 and more fully in 2019, reflecting the company’s capacity to reconfigure resources and reconstitute operational trajectories in response to market shifts. Liquidity and capital resource management further support resilience, with $2.10 billion in cash and cash equivalents, a $2.50 billion unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility—of which the company preserves undrawn capacity equal to outstanding commercial paper to ensure continuity of funding under stressed conditions—and planned use of existing cash balances and short-term borrowings to fund acquisitions. The company’s ongoing risk mitigation and adaptability are reinforced by systematic impairment reviews of intangible assets and goodwill under adverse economic and technological environments, proactive tax planning and valuation allowances for non-U.S. operations, evaluation of contingent liabilities and pension obligations, and continuous refinement of estimates and assumptions underpinning financial reporting, all of which contribute to preserving system integrity, operational flexibility and organizational health despite internal and external disturbances.

Tesla’s management has documented multiple operational strategies and risk-mitigation measures that reflect its capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under internal and external pressures. The Company continued to scale its automotive operations through the dramatic ramp of Model 3 production, achieving total production of 254,530 vehicles and deliveries of 245,506 vehicles in 2018, while enhancing customer-facing processes by purchasing dedicated car-hauling trucks, expanding service locations, mobile service fleet, two-shift service center operations, and optimizing its parts distribution network. It is focused on cost improvements and affordability, stabilized delivery and logistics systems, and continually evolves Supercharger infrastructure to enable faster charging times at reduced costs. Addressing potential bottlenecks and establishing sustained supplier capacity, Tesla is optimizing and simplifying its production process at Gigafactory Shanghai, and working through challenges typical of large-scale ramps at Gigafactory 1 and other manufacturing sites, including regulatory approvals, supply-chain constraints, and equipment installation pacing. In the energy generation and storage segment, management is reducing customer acquisition costs by shifting to direct sales channels and cross-selling to vehicle owners, prioritizing upfront cash-generating retrofit solar projects, iterating designs on the Solar Roof with the expectation of significantly improved manufacturing capabilities, and targeting more than doubling energy storage deployments to over 2 GWh in 2019 while exploiting opportunities to mitigate high electricity rates and enhance grid reliability. Across all segments, Tesla’s emphasis on operational efficiency—evidenced by expectations to decrease operating expenses as a percentage of revenue and manage growth in line with revenue increases—alongside ongoing innovation, financing alternatives, and localized production efficiencies underscore its systemic perspective and resilience strategy to maintain integrity and performance amid market volatility, political and trade uncertainties, tax credit phase-outs, and evolving regulatory constraints.

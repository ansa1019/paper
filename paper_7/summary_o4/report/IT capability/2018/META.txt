In 2018, we continued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities by investing, based on our roadmap, in our most developed ecosystems and in long-term technology initiatives such as connectivity, artificial intelligence, and augmented and virtual reality; we intend to continue these investments in 2019 by expanding our data center capacity, network infrastructure, and office facilities, scaling our headcount to support our growth, and increasing our commitments to safety and security, marketing, video content and technology initiatives; we plan to continue hiring software engineers, technical, marketing, sales and administrative employees to support research and development, marketing and partnership efforts, and community operations; our cost of revenue reflects ongoing investments in data center operations, server equipment, energy and bandwidth, and partner arrangements, and our research and development expenses reflect building new products and improving existing products; to secure network component volume or pricing we may enter into multi-year agreements, and our operating lease obligations for offices, land and colocation support continuity of operations; we believe that our non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information and transparency on key metrics used by management in operating our business; our principal sources of liquidity remain cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash generated from operations and an undrawn revolving credit facility, and in 2018 we established a multi-currency notional cash pool extending overdraft credit to participating entities under a parent guarantee to mitigate foreign currency and liquidity risks; we currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facility and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future; we regularly review useful lives of intangible assets and goodwill for impairment and adopt new accounting standards such as the forthcoming lease standard on a modified retrospective basis to maintain system integrity and performance under evolving external pressures.

In the Management’s Discussion, the Company cautions that its multi‐year, largely fixed‐cost content commitments may limit its flexibility to plan for or react to changes in its business and market segments, as upfront payments for original programming exceed amortization and may strain liquidity if membership acquisition and revenue growth do not meet expectations. The report details the allocation of increased resources toward original programming to differentiate the service, enhance brand strength and attract and retain members—an initiative that entails additional production costs, completion and key talent risks, ongoing guild payments and potential liabilities. As the Company expands internationally and scales its streaming service, it emphasizes ongoing development and refinement of technology infrastructure, including proprietary content‐delivery networks and third‐party cloud computing services, to ensure operational continuity in the face of network operator practices, device compatibility challenges, regulatory changes, natural disasters, cybersecurity threats and other external perturbations. It notes that significant disruptions or unauthorized access to its systems or those of third‐party providers, as well as adverse actions by rights holders, collection management organizations or studios, could degrade service availability, erode consumer trust and require rapid adjustments to content offerings, partnerships and marketing strategies. The Company expects to continue making substantial investments in global streaming content and marketing programs, supported by debt and equity financing, while acknowledging that its success depends on its ability to manage change and growth, deploy resources effectively, mitigate risk exposures and maintain service integrity and performance under challenging conditions.

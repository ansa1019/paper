We operate in an environment characterized by both complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures, which has led us to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services, and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S. and international customers at affordable prices. Recognizing that our customers are resource-constrained, we are developing and extending our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner with a focus on adjacent markets close to our core capabilities, and we are growing our international sales through strengthened partnerships and joint technology efforts. We continue to emphasize affordability initiatives while innovating and investing in technologies to meet evolving mission requirements and in our people to ensure the technical skills necessary to succeed, thereby maintaining operational flexibility without limiting our ability to return a substantial portion of free cash flow to investors. Through independent research and development, selective acquisitions, divestitures and internal realignments, we reconfigure our portfolio to meet current and future customer needs, expand access to new customers or technologies, and divest businesses that no longer align with our strategy. Given the size and complexity of key programs such as the F-35, we employ continuous capability development and delivery strategies and anticipate ongoing reviews of performance, schedule, cost and requirements under government and partner oversight, adapting our forecasts and risk assessments as conditions evolve. We maintain active relationships with a diverse group of financial institutions to ensure access to credit, closely monitor financial market conditions, and use derivatives to hedge foreign-currency and interest-rate exposures, all of which support business continuity and risk mitigation. We make targeted capital expenditures in equipment, facilities and information technology to support new and existing programs across our segments, and we manage environmental remediation obligations under U.S. government regulations, continually assessing our financial exposure and recovery of costs through contract pricing. In combination with a balanced cash-deployment strategy—encompassing dividends, share repurchases, debt management and disciplined pension funding—we have structured our financial and operational practices to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite internal or external variations and disturbances.

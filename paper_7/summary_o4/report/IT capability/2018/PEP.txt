PepsiCo discloses that in response to “challenging conditions” across more than 200 countries—ranging from macroeconomic and political volatility, civil unrest, regulatory changes, natural disasters and currency fluctuations—the company maintains business continuity and positive adjustment by continually monitoring and adapting its operating and political environment exposures, evaluating and updating actions to mitigate unfavorable impacts, and sustaining operational flexibility through an integrated risk management framework.  This framework, under board oversight and supported by cross-functional risk committees and a dedicated risk management office, enables the company to identify, assess, prioritize, address, manage, monitor and communicate strategic, financial, operational, compliance, safety, reputational and other risks; to stress test commodity, foreign-exchange and interest-rate risks via hedging programs; to secure supply through diversified sourcing and fixed-price contracts; and to deploy productivity initiatives—including multi-year programs to simplify, harmonize and automate processes, re-engineer go-to-market systems, optimize manufacturing and supply-chain footprints, and transform core capabilities with technology—to preserve and enhance functioning, preserve resource integrity and foster competitive advantage under both nominal and extreme conditions.  Combined with scenario planning, rigorous stress testing, ongoing global purchasing programs and hedging strategies, targeted investments in talent and technology, and refranchising and restructuring actions to shift toward asset-light models, these measures support PepsiCo’s ability to adapt to environmental disruptions, maintain integrity and performance, and emerge stronger from disruptive events while positioning the organization for long-term sustainable growth.

Starbucks results for fiscal 2018 reflect the impact of certain restructuring and streamlining efforts, beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, to focus on accelerating growth in high-returning businesses and removing non-core, slow growth activities; these efforts primarily include “the acquisition of our East China joint venture, the conversion of our Singapore, Taiwan and Brazil operations to licensed models, the closure of Teavana retail stores, the sale of the Tazo brand, the licensing of our CPG and foodservice businesses to Nestlé, and the closure of certain company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada, among other actions,” spanning across all segments and our corporate functions. Concurrently, we realigned our organizational and operating segment structures in support of the newly established global coffee alliance, restated reportable segments as if those smaller businesses were previously within our channel development segment, revised our prior period financial information to reflect comparable financial information for the new segment structure and retrospectively reclassified certain costs “in an effort to report operating expenses in line with the corresponding revenue generating activities.” As a result of acquiring the remaining interest in our East China joint venture, we transitioned from the equity method to consolidation, absorbing incremental depreciation and amortization expenses and lower income from equity investees while enabling disciplined investments in our business and partners. Fiscal 2018 operating margin compression was primarily driven by food and beverage-related mix shifts, the impact of our ownership change in East China, “higher restructuring and impairment costs” and “higher salaries and benefits related to digital platforms, technology infrastructure and innovations,” all of which underpin our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under challenging conditions. To support business continuity and operational flexibility, we actively managed cash and investments to internally fund operating needs, scheduled interest and principal payments, acquisitions and returns to shareholders through $8.9 billion of share repurchases and $1.7 billion of dividends, maintained compliance with covenants under our unsecured revolving and 364-day credit facilities, and mitigated market volatility through commodity and foreign currency hedges. Looking ahead to fiscal 2019, we expect continued growth through thoughtful long-term investments that create value and reward shareholders, driven by our three strategic priorities to “accelerate growth in our targeted, long-term growth markets of the U.S. and China,” “expand the global reach of the Starbucks brand leveraging the global coffee alliance,” and “sharpen our focus on increasing shareholder returns,” undertaking initiatives including enhancement of the in-store experience, customer-relevant beverage innovation, digital relationships, new store expansion, and retail market realignment to “amplify our focus and resources on core value drivers with the greatest prospect for returns,” thereby preserving and improving organizational performance despite external pressures and environmental disturbances.

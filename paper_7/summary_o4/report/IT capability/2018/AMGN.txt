The MD&A discloses that Amgen’s strategy “includes a set of integrated activities intended to maintain and strengthen our competitive position in the industry,” advancing its innovative pipeline and branded biosimilar programs, increasing global geographic reach and expanding next-generation manufacturing capabilities to “maintain a reliable, high-quality, compliant supply of medicines.” Cash inflows from operating activities of $11.3 billion “enabled us to invest in our business while returning capital to shareholders,” and the company has established productivity initiatives as part of “transformation and process improvement efforts” that “enable us to reallocate resources to fund many of our innovative pipeline and growth opportunities” and have realized approximately $1.9 billion of savings, which were reinvested in product launches, clinical programs and external business development. To mitigate external pressures and financial variability, Amgen employs hedging activities “to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure,” and maintains global access to its $29.3 billion balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities following enactment of the 2017 Tax Act, supporting working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, dividends and share repurchases. The company underscores that its “long-term success depends, to a great extent, on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies” and to “develop new products over time in order to provide for revenue growth and to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity or competing products are launched,” reflecting a systemic perspective on adaptation and resilience to competitive and regulatory disruptions. Amgen anticipates satisfying its liquidity needs through diverse sources—operating cash flows, sales of marketable securities, commercial paper, syndicated credit facilities and access to domestic and foreign debt and equity markets—thereby preserving operational continuity and financial flexibility under varying conditions. Contingent liabilities and loss contingencies are reviewed quarterly and accrued when probable and estimable, deferred tax assets and liabilities are managed through valuation allowances based on projections of future taxable income, and long-lived assets and intangible assets acquired in business combinations are assessed for recoverability, all demonstrating formal risk assessment, resource preservation and organizational flexibility in the face of internal and external disturbances.

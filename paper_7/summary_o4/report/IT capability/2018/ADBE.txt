During fiscal 2018, we completed the acquisitions of Marketo for $4.74 billion and Magento for $1.64 billion and, consistent with our prior integration of TubeMogul, continue to integrate these businesses into our digital experience segment, and we subsequently acquired the remaining interest in Allegorithmic to be folded into our digital media segment in fiscal 2019, reflecting our approach to reconstitute and reconfigure our portfolio toward sustained future growth under challenging conditions. We allocate purchase prices to tangible and intangible assets based on significant estimates and assumptions, make judgments and estimates that affect reported amounts and regularly reevaluate these critical accounting policies in conjunction with our audit committee to preserve integrity and performance under varied market pressures. To mitigate external disturbances such as foreign currency volatility, we employ a currency hedging program, interest rate swaps that convert fixed-rate debt to floating-rate obligations, a $1 billion revolving credit facility and a $2.25 billion term loan to ensure operational continuity and maintain liquidity even under extreme conditions. We recognize subscription revenue ratably over contract terms and monitor deferred and unbilled deferred revenue backlog—both of which support business continuity despite fluctuations in timing of renewals and billing—and we adjust our assumptions to manage risk and performance variability. We invest heavily in research and development, data center infrastructure and professional services, while our structured stock repurchase program and cash management strategies serve to return value to stockholders and minimize dilution. We maintain indemnification arrangements, reserve for uncertain tax positions and remeasure deferred taxes under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, reflecting our commitment to risk mitigation, resource reconfiguration and preserving system integrity. Together, these strategies, processes and resources demonstrate our ability to absorb strain, adapt to internal and external constraints and maintain or improve functioning in the face of adversity, in line with the definition of organizational resilience as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

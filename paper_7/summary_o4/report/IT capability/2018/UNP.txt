During 2018, management intensified its focus on safety to “reduce risk and eliminate incidents” through multi-faceted initiatives such as “courage to care,” “total safety culture,” and UpWay (our continuous improvement culture) and expanded deployment of technology, risk assessment, training and employee engagement programs to identify and implement best practices, thereby strengthening the organization’s ability to absorb strain and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. In response to network congestion and elevated freight car inventories, the first phase of our Unified Plan 2020 was implemented to “increase reliability of our service product, reduce variability in network operations, and improve resource utilization,” including a reduction of the active locomotive fleet by 625 units and a more than 10% decrease in operating car inventory while handling similar volume levels, which contributed to a 14% improvement in average terminal dwell in the fourth quarter. Our 2019 capital plan of approximately $3.2 billion, of which 75%–80% is directed to renewing and improving existing infrastructure and the remainder to new capacity investments, locomotive modernization and freight cars, reflects a strategic allocation of resources designed to preserve system integrity, operational continuity and performance maintenance under both nominal and extreme conditions. Financial resilience is evidenced by $8.7 billion of cash from operations yielding $3.0 billion of free cash flow, access to a $2 billion revolving credit facility with no borrowings outstanding, a $650 million receivables securitization facility, and disciplined share repurchase programs, all of which underpin our liquidity and capacity to reconfigure trajectories toward the future. We conduct sensitivity analyses of fuel and interest rate volatility, maintain actuarial reserves for personal injury and environmental liabilities at 334 sites, and employ productivity savings and core pricing gains to offset inflation and external pressures, collectively illustrating our dynamic capabilities to adapt, recover and emerge stronger from disruptions.

Cost savings resulting from our transformation initiatives continue to be redeployed in research and development and other areas of higher priorities, reflecting a deliberate reconfiguration of resources to preserve and enhance functioning under changing conditions. our four strategic priorities—to drive business performance, build a leading franchise in immuno-oncology, maintain a diversified portfolio both within and outside of io, and continue a disciplined approach to capital allocation through partnerships, collaborations and in-licensing or acquiring investigational compounds—demonstrate our focus on resource deployment and operational flexibility as means of sustaining performance under external pressures. through our operating model transformation, we have successfully concentrated commercial, r&d and manufacturing resources on prioritized brands and markets, strengthened our r&d capabilities in tumor biology, patient selection and biomarkers, delivered leaner administrative functions and streamlined our manufacturing network to reflect the importance of biologics in our portfolio, thereby enhancing our strategic, financial and operational flexibility for future opportunities. acquisitions, divestitures, licensing and collaboration arrangements allow us to focus resources behind growth opportunities that drive the greatest long-term value, while continuous evaluation of our capital structure, including the use of bridge and term loan facilities and forward-starting interest rate swap options, supports liquidity and hedges risk associated with major transactions. we regularly monitor economic and regulatory developments, including the u.k. departure from the eu, and believe these factors will not materially impair our liquidity, cash flow or financial flexibility. in compliance with our sec consent order, we maintain governance processes and varied methodologies to estimate and limit direct-customer inventory to expected demand, ensuring business continuity and mitigating the risk of excess channel inventories. continuous improvement in our governance, risk assessment and resource allocation processes manifests a systemic perspective on preserving organizational integrity and performance amid internal and external perturbations.

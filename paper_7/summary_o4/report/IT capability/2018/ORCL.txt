Our management’s discussion and analysis explains that providing choice and flexibility to customers as to when and how they deploy our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies is an important element of our corporate strategy and supports continuity of operations, while our chief operating decision-makers view results and allocate resources across our cloud and license, hardware and services businesses to align research and development investments and strategic acquisitions with targeted earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital objectives, thereby enabling the organization to absorb market pressures, adapt offerings, reconfigure trajectories and preserve performance under varying conditions. We employ considerable judgment and estimates in revenue recognition, multiple-element arrangements and the accounting for income taxes, legal contingencies and business combinations, and we enter into cross-currency and interest-rate swap agreements to mitigate foreign currency and interest-rate risks. We maintain liquidity and operational flexibility through internally generated cash, marketable securities, revolver facilities and long-term borrowings, execute restructuring plans to improve cost structures, manage headcount and consolidate facilities, and perform annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessments as part of our risk management framework. Credit facilities, disciplined share repurchases and a consistent dividend program support financial resilience and organizational strength, while our stock-based compensation program helps secure human capital and align employee incentives with the company’s long-term growth and stability.

ADP invests in highly strategic areas and technology to strengthen its underlying business model and prospects for continued growth, innovating by anticipating workforce trends such as the gig economy to reshape its cloud-based HCM platforms and enhance its ability to address the full worker spectrum, thereby preserving and improving functioning under evolving conditions. During fiscal 2018, the company continued migrating clients to strategic platforms and made R&D investments to provide best-in-class cloud-based HCM solutions, reflecting operational flexibility and resource reconfiguration, and strengthened retention through a focus on improving the client experience. Transformation initiatives, including a voluntary early retirement program, service alignment, and the formation of a transformation office, support its ongoing strategy to streamline operations, extend global distribution, and leverage talent and culture, maintaining performance and business continuity amid external pressures. ADP maintains a high percentage of recurring revenues, healthy margins, and disciplined capital allocation, supported by increased operating cash flow from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and preserves system resilience through diversified liquidity sources—its $9.8 billion commercial paper program, committed credit facilities, reverse repurchase agreements, and laddered maturities of client-fund investments—to mitigate liquidity, interest-rate, and credit risks and ensure the integrity of funds held for clients. Forward-looking risk management encompasses security or cyber breach mitigation, system interruption safeguards, and contingency planning for economic and regulatory uncertainties, enabling the company to continue generating consistent cash flows, adapt to disruptions, and emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

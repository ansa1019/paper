In our MD&A, we discuss initiatives such as our un-carrier strategy, including service innovations like the “un-carrier next” customer support model that reorganized operational structures to solve pain points and ensure business continuity, and the rebranding of MetroPCS as Metro by T-Mobile with new unlimited rate plans to adapt to market perceptions. We highlight our ability to acquire and retain branded customers through ongoing network improvements and un-carrier initiatives that demonstrate operational flexibility and resource allocation under competitive pressures, evidenced by branded customer growth and improved churn metrics. We have also executed strategic acquisitions of Iowa Wireless Services and Layer3 TV to reconstitute service trajectories, integrate external knowledge and advance our video strategy, demonstrating organizational change processes and resource reconfiguration for future growth. Our proposed Sprint merger is expected to accelerate nationwide 5G deployment and innovation, reflecting a systemic perspective on reconfiguring assets to build competitive advantage and network resilience. During 2018’s hurricanes, we incurred incremental costs to maintain services in Puerto Rico and elsewhere under extreme conditions and recognized insurance reimbursements, illustrating resourcefulness, risk mitigation and recovery activities that preserve functionality in the face of adversity. We emphasize strategic investments in 4G LTE expansion, low-band spectrum deployment and 5G groundwork, reflecting adaptability to environmental disruptions and long-term performance maintenance. Our liquidity and capital resources discussion details use of cash flows, securitization arrangements, debt financing and revolving credit facilities to ensure financial resilience and future orientation under potential market volatility. Similarly, our critical accounting policies for revenue recognition, allowance for credit losses, deferred purchase price valuation and asset impairment testing underscore internal knowledge processes, risk assessment, uncertainty management and systemic change mechanisms to maintain organizational health and integrity under changing conditions.

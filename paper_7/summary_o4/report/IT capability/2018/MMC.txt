In connection with the pending acquisition of Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc, the company secured funding through a £5.2 billion bridge loan agreement, hedged the risk of appreciation of the GBP-denominated purchase price by entering into a deal contingent foreign exchange contract and treasury lock contracts related to $2 billion of expected debt—recording unrealized losses of $325 million and $116 million, respectively—thereby applying strategic resource deployment and risk-mitigation mechanisms to preserve transaction integrity; Marsh initiated a program to simplify the organization through reduced management layers and more common structures across regions and businesses to more closely align with its segmentation strategy, expected to create increased efficiencies and additional capacity for reinvestment in people and technology, and incurred $96 million of restructuring severance and consulting costs, while Mercer combined its investment and retirement businesses into a newly-created wealth business to better align global investment management capabilities and incurred $51 million of related restructuring costs, demonstrating operational flexibility and system reconfiguration; the Risk and Insurance Services segment continued to offer risk management activities (risk advice, risk transfer and risk control and mitigation solutions) and completed twelve acquisitions in 2018 to enhance its global service platforms; consolidated revenue increased 7% to $14.95 billion in 2018, and the adoption of the new revenue standard shifted income among quarters without materially affecting year-over-year performance, underscoring continuity in operating outcomes; the company generated $2.4 billion of cash from operations, reflecting changes in working capital and pension contributions, and expects to continue repatriating available foreign earnings while permanently reinvesting where appropriate; to maintain pension plan integrity, it contributed $30 million to U.S. plans and $82 million to non-U.S. plans in 2018 and expects contributions of approximately $28 million and $65 million, respectively, in 2019, and amended its Canadian and U.S. defined benefit plans to discontinue further accruals and introduce defined contribution arrangements, recognizing the funded status of its plans in its consolidated balance sheets and recording unrecognized actuarial losses in accumulated other comprehensive income; fiduciary interest income from segregated client funds is separately presented; and the company maintained strong liquidity and operational continuity through an undrawn $1.8 billion revolving credit facility, a short-term commercial paper program and the issuance of senior notes to fund strategic initiatives and share repurchases, thereby reinforcing its capacity to adapt and sustain performance under internal and external pressures.

Merck’s 2018 performance demonstrates execution of its innovation strategy, with revenue growth driven by its oncology, vaccines and animal health franchises, disciplined allocation of resources to support near-term commercial opportunities while making necessary investments for long-term growth, and expanded its capital expenditures program primarily to increase future manufacturing capacity. Its global restructuring programs designed to streamline its cost structure included sale or closure of manufacturing facilities, consolidation of office facilities and reduction of its real estate footprint, improving the efficiency and agility of its manufacturing and supply network. In response to a June 2017 network cyber-attack that disrupted manufacturing, research and sales operations and led to significant order backlogs, the company recorded remediation expenses, utilized insurance coverage despite disputes over claim availability, reversed unfavorable manufacturing variances, and restored operational continuity with costs immaterial in 2018. Merck maintains a conservative financial profile—placing cash and investments in high-credit-quality instruments, limiting credit exposure through a $6 billion unused revolving credit facility, and executing $10 billion of share repurchase authorizations including $5 billion of accelerated share repurchase agreements—while managing external pressures from health care cost containment by forecasting continued pricing and market access impacts and adapting its strategic responses. Its research and development model is designed to increase productivity and improve the probability of success by prioritizing internal programs and supplementing them with an external alliance and licensing strategy across the full spectrum of collaborations, reflecting a systemic, multifaceted approach to organizational resilience and adaptability under challenging conditions.

PepsiCo, as a global company with deep local ties, reported that during 2022 it confronted a range of internal and external pressures—including supply chain disruptions, inflationary cost environments, shifting consumer preferences and behaviors, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, climate-related risks, geopolitical volatility such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, a rapidly evolving retail landscape and an uncertain regulatory environment—and to preserve its integrity and performance under these challenging conditions the company has implemented “pep+” (PepsiCo Positive), a strategic end-to-end transformation placing sustainability and human capital at its core to drive operational flexibility, resource reconfiguration and business continuity; it has established an integrated risk management framework, overseen by the Board and its committees and supported by the PepsiCo Risk Committee as well as division and market risk committees, that systematically identifies, assesses, prioritizes, mitigates and monitors strategic, financial, operational, compliance, safety, reputational and geopolitical risks; it manages commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate volatility through productivity initiatives, fixed-price contracts, pricing agreements and derivative instruments; it monitors macroeconomic and political conditions and adjusts its strategies, including suspending operations, reallocating capital and taking impairment charges as needed; it pursues regenerative agriculture partnerships and circular value-chain goals to strengthen its supply base; it continues to expand digital and e-commerce capabilities to adapt to retail disruption; and it maintains disclosure and escalation processes to ensure that resilience strategies—designed to absorb strain, reconstitute trajectories of response to disruptive events and reconfigure toward the ensuing future—are embedded in its governance and disclosure controls.

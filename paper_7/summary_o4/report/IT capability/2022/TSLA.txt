In 2022, we produced 1,369,611 consumer vehicles and delivered 1,313,851 consumer vehicles despite ongoing supply chain and logistics challenges and factory shutdowns, and we continue to ramp production, build new manufacturing capacity and expand our operations to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products and further revenue growth. These plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by the new product and manufacturing technologies we are introducing, the number of concurrent international projects, industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages and any future impact from events outside of our control such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the next phase of production growth will depend on the ramp at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells to achieve high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Our cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehiclesâ€™ affordability and resilience in the face of component constraints and inflationary pressures and have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles in China; we will also continue to generate demand and brand awareness by improving vehicle performance and functionality, including through AI-based products such as Autopilot and FSD, and by delivering new vehicles such as the Tesla Semi in December 2022. As our production increases, we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so that it does not become a bottleneck on our total deliveries; beginning in the second half of 2022, due to continuing challenges caused by vehicle transportation capacity during peak delivery periods, we began transitioning to a more even regional mix of vehicle builds each week, which led to an increase in cars in transit at year-end. Increasing exports from Gigafactory Shanghai has also been effective in mitigating the strain on our deliveries in markets outside of the United States, and we expect further benefit from situating factories closer to local markets. As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will have to continue to increase and staff our delivery, servicing and charging infrastructure, maintain vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost-effectiveness and customer satisfaction. We continue to increase the production of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand and remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a low-cost, simplified online ordering experience while improving installation capabilities and price efficiencies for Solar Roof; as these product lines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply and hire additional personnel, particularly skilled electricians, to support ramp-up. Our capital expenditures are difficult to project beyond the short term given the number and breadth of our core projects and may be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions; we are simultaneously ramping new products, manufacturing facilities on three continents and piloting new battery cell technologies, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on project priorities, achievement of milestones, production adjustments, capital efficiencies and addition of new projects. We currently expect capital expenditures of $6.0 to $8.0 billion in 2023 and $7.0 to $9.0 billion in each of the following two fiscal years. Our business has consistently generated cash flow from operations in excess of capital spend, and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is facilitating positive cash generation; we will continue to utilize such cash flows to support vertical integration, product roadmap expansion and customer financing options. While we generally expect operating expenses relative to revenue to decrease through increased operational efficiency and automation, expenses will grow in 2023 as we expand globally. We expect to continue generating net positive operating cash flow, which enables us to fund ongoing operations, production, R&D projects, manufacturing ramps at existing and new facilities including Fremont, Gigafactory Nevada, Shanghai, New York, Berlin-Brandenburg and Texas, and expansion of retail and service locations, body shops, mobile service fleets, Supercharger network and energy product installation capabilities. Given the growth-funding nature of our expenditures, we believe we can adjust our capital and operating expenditure pace by segment and, if needed, raise additional capital or draw upon debt facilities while retaining the option to repay indebtedness early; accordingly, we believe our current sources of funds provide adequate liquidity for at least the 12-month period following December 31, 2022, and long term.

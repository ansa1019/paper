In fiscal 2022, Intuit conducted business with modifications to employee work locations, reopening nearly all sites and transitioning to a hybrid office–remote model under continual evaluation and refinement to maintain operational continuity under pandemic-related constraints. While experiencing no significant disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic or the Russia-Ukraine war, management acknowledged uncertainty regarding their full impact on operations, demand, macroeconomic conditions and regulatory actions. Intuit’s designation as a Small Business Administration lender under the Paycheck Protection Program illustrates its deployment of financial resources to support small business continuity during the pandemic. Strategic acquisitions of Credit Karma and Mailchimp, along with segment realignments for Mint, reflect reconfiguration of organizational structures and resource allocation toward evolving market objectives. To sustain competitive advantage amid disruptive technological trends and dynamic customer expectations, the company invested significant resources in product development, marketing and sales capabilities, and in the ongoing operation, availability and security of its online platforms, including ISO 27001 certification, industry-wide anti-fraud collaborations and periodic security reviews. In its financial reporting processes, management applies judgment in revenue recognition, business combination accounting, and goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessments, monitoring indicators of impairment and refining assumptions to preserve system integrity, ensure compliance and support continued performance under variable external pressures.

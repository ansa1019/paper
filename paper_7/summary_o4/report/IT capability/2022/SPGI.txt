During 2022, following the completion of our merger with IHS Markit, we reorganized our reportable segments, increasing from four reportable segments to six reportable segments; the merger with IHS Markit brings together two world-class organizations with leading brands and capabilities across information services that will be uniquely positioned to serve, facilitate and power the markets of the future. On January 14, 2023, we entered into a securities and asset purchase agreement to sell our engineering solutions business for $975 million in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments, and we currently anticipate the divestiture to result in after-tax proceeds of approximately $750 million, which proceeds are expected to be used for share repurchases, following our announced intent in November of 2022 to divest the business; the transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2023. During the three years ended December 31, 2022, we returned approximately $15.6 billion to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases of approximately $13.2 billion and regular quarterly dividends totaling approximately $2.4 billion. In 2018, we announced the launch of Powering the Markets of the Future to provide a framework for our forward-looking business strategy; through this framework, we seek to deliver an exceptional, differentiated customer experience by enhancing our foundational capabilities, evolving and growing our core businesses, and pursuing growth via adjacencies. In 2023, we are striving to deliver on our strategic priorities in the following key areas: meeting or exceeding our organic revenue growth and EBITA margin targets; realizing our merger/integration commitments—cost and revenue synergy targets; driving growth and superior shareholder returns through effective execution, active portfolio management and prudent capital allocation; enhancing customer support and seamless user experience with a focus on ease of discoverability, distribution, and delivery of our products and services and integrated capabilities; continuing to invest in customer-facing solutions and processes; continuing to fund and accelerate key growth areas and transformational adjacencies; exercising disciplined organic capital allocation, inorganic and partnership strategies; growing the value of S&P Global’s brand through an integrated marketing and communication strategy; efficient integration, accessibility and governance of enterprise data assets, with initial focus on sustainability data, data science and enterprise-wide data management through the formation of a data council to drive enterprise value creation; advancing the transition to optimize tech spend practice, shifting the balance towards funding higher-growth innovation, establishing key spend benchmarks and a three-year transition plan; continuing momentum in transitioning all products and services to a cloud-based ecosystem while implementing technologies that align to our customer needs and unlock new opportunities; continuing to improve diverse representation through hiring, advancement and retention, while continuing to raise awareness through diversity, equity, and inclusion education; ensuring our people are engaged with a particular focus on learning, development and career opportunities and continue to embed our purpose and values throughout the company; and driving continuous commitment to risk management, compliance, and control across S&P Global and creating a more sustainable impact.

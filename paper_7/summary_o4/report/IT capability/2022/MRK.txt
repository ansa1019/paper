Merck continues to execute strategic business development transactions to augment its robust internal pipeline with external science, including collaborations and licensing agreements with Moderna, Orna, Orion and Sichuan Kelun-Biotech and the acquisition of Imago Biosciences, reflecting deliberate resource reconfiguration, inter-organizational collaboration and dynamic capabilities to absorb strain and preserve performance under challenging conditions. The company works cross-functionally across the globe to monitor and mitigate interruptions to business continuity arising from disruptive events such as the war in Ukraine and COVID-19-related disruptions, ensuring patients and customers continued access to medicines and vaccines while maintaining compliance with international sanctions and adapting supply chains, clinical trials and manufacturing facilities funded in part by BARDA. A global restructuring program to optimize the manufacturing and supply network and reduce the real estate footprint incurred $666 million of restructuring costs in 2022 and is expected to generate approximately $900 million of annual net cost savings by end 2023, illustrating an organizational trajectory of reconstituting internal structures and implementing adaptation strategies. Revenue hedging and balance sheet risk management programs employ foreign currency derivatives, net investment hedges and interest rate instruments to manage exposure to exchange-rate and interest-rate fluctuations, thereby reinforcing system resilience. Capital allocation priorities, including near- and long-term growth investments, dividend commitments and up to $10 billion in share repurchase authorizations, demonstrate proactive resource allocation and financial resilience. Quality control measures to reduce nitrosamine levels in sitagliptin-containing products, responses to supply-chain volatility, government-mandated pricing actions and legislative reforms further exemplify the companyâ€™s capabilities for risk assessment, emergency management and positive adjustment to maintain integrity and performance amidst internal and external perturbations.

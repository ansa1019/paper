During fiscal 2021 and 2022, Nike undertook a series of leadership and operating model changes to streamline and accelerate strategic execution of its consumer direct acceleration, including a net reduction in global workforce with related pre-tax charges of $294 million in fiscal 2021 and immaterial costs in fiscal 2022, and expects future wage-related savings will be reinvested to execute the next phase of its strategy.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated global supply chain volatility, the company achieved record revenues with 5% growth and 120 basis points of gross margin expansion in fiscal 2022 despite temporary store closures in Greater China, loss of approximately three months of production, elevated in-transit inventory that drove inventories to $8.4 billion, and higher transportation, logistics and fulfillment costs.  To mitigate these impacts, teams have leveraged an operational playbook by balancing inventory across geographies, implementing pricing actions and employing a seasonless product approach, while globally nearly all supplier factories have resumed operations with production exceeding pre-closure levels.  Nike has continued to invest in its digital transformation, data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering and an end-to-end technology foundation, and plans multi-year investment in digital capabilities and brand campaigns to transform its business of the future and drive long-term financial goals.  The company remains committed to effectively managing its business and mitigating financial market risks through a centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program—leveraging natural offsets, currency correlations, forward and option contracts to hedge transactional and translational exposures, including a factory currency adjustment program and net investment hedges—to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  Liquidity and capital resources are supported by $13.0 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, a $3 billion commercial paper program, $3 billion of committed credit facilities, strong investment-grade credit ratings, a shelf registration for unlimited debt securities, and multi-year share repurchase programs, providing financial flexibility to fund debt obligations, operating leases, endorsement contracts, product and other purchase commitments, capital expenditures (expected at approximately 3% of annual revenues) and potential contingencies, all of which underpin the organization’s ability to absorb strain, preserve functioning and pursue growth under challenging conditions.

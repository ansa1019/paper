In connection with the Sprint merger, we completed integration and decommissioning activities—including the retirement of legacy CDMA and LTE networks, rationalization of duplicative networks, backhaul services and retail stores, migration of customers to our nationwide 5G network and contract terminations, severance and restructuring costs—to achieve significant synergies, preserve or improve functioning despite integration pressures and maintain our operating performance under challenging conditions. We continue to evaluate additional restructuring initiatives through consultations and negotiations with counterparties, allocating principal sources of funding sufficient to meet liquidity requirements and anticipated payments, and we expect to realize merger synergies of approximately $7.4 billion in cost of service and SG&A expense reductions in 2023 by eliminating redundancies and reconfiguring network and business processes. Following a criminal cyberattack in August 2021, we recorded a pre-tax charge for remediation and settlement costs, committed $150 million in incremental spend for data security under a proposed settlement agreement and intend to allocate substantial additional resources toward multi-year cybersecurity initiatives to strengthen our protection mechanisms, transform our approach to incident response and enhance our ability to absorb hazards and maintain system integrity. We monitor macroeconomic trends—including potential economic recession, inflation, changes in monetary policy and geopolitical risks—and mitigate exposure through fixed-rate contracts, limited debt fungibility and interest rate hedges, while our revolving credit facility, securitization of receivables and robust free cash flow generation support business continuity and operational flexibility. Our capital expenditure program, which included $14 billion in network build-out and spectrum license acquisitions in the 600 MHz, C-band, 3.45 GHz and 2.5 GHz bands, reflects a systemic perspective on resource allocation to expand capacity, enhance network resilience to environmental perturbations and respond effectively to external disturbances. We leverage financing lease facilities to fund network equipment and tower obligations, manage purchase commitments for devices, software and services, and regularly reassess contractual obligations to maintain strategic agility and system resilience. Our debt management activities—issuing and retiring long-term notes, maintaining compliance with indenture covenants and optimizing our debt profile—support our ability to adapt to changing financing markets, preserve liquidity and sustain performance under pressure. Performance measures such as adjusted EBITDA, core adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow guide our resource deployment, collateral learning from prior integration and cybersecurity events and enable us to project temporal trajectories of responses, reconstitute strategies in immediate response to events and reconfigure toward the ensuing future, thereby reflecting our multifaceted approach to maintaining positive adjustment under adversity and driving organizational evolution.

In our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we describe our long-term capital allocation strategy, which prioritizes acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases to deploy resources in support of business continuity and adaptability under challenging conditions; we detail our response to macroeconomic pressures—including inflationary cost increases for labor, steel, transportation and electronic components and global supply chain disruptions—through measures such as premium spot-market purchases of critical components and pre-buying of raw materials to preserve production and shipments; we explain our decision to continue limited operations in Russia where safety permits while monitoring the broader impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on energy prices and supply chains; we outline our strategic adaptations to China’s volume-based procurement and import purchase evaluation programs, including both successful bids that guarantee sales volume and unsuccessful bids that led to product-line exits; we discuss the acquisition of Vocera to diversify our product portfolio, advance digital innovations and strengthen our systemic responsiveness; we highlight our maintenance of robust liquidity and financial flexibility via revolving credit facilities, term loans maturing in 2025 and investment-grade debt ratings to ensure access to capital at competitive rates; we recount our annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including a $216 million impairment charge in our spine reporting unit in 2022 to reconfigure underperforming assets and preserve overall organizational performance; we describe the establishment and adjustment of reserves for product recalls, legal and tax contingencies and inventory obsolescence to mitigate potential losses and adapt obligations as circumstances evolve; we explain our critical accounting policies for inventory reserves, deferred tax assets and liabilities, long-lived asset recoverability and defined benefit pension funding, which rely on judgment and estimation to maintain the integrity of financial reporting under variable conditions; and we emphasize our use of non-GAAP measures—excluding acquisition, integration and other nonrecurring items—to provide a stable baseline for assessing underlying operational trends and performance maintenance.

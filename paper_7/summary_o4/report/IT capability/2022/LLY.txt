As part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and at the request of the United States and international governments, we invested in large-scale manufacturing of COVID-19 antibodies at risk, in order to ensure rapid access to patients around the world, focused on researching, developing, and supplying COVID-19 therapies, and implemented actions to minimize patient impact amid intermittent supply delays for key incretin products; we anticipate tight supplies will persist until additional internal and contracted manufacturing capacity becomes fully operational, reflecting our ongoing efforts to meet significant demand and maintain operational continuity. Our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire, develop, and commercialize innovative new medicines across approximately 45 candidates in clinical development or under regulatory review, and we manage research and development spending across our portfolio so that a delay or termination of any one project will not materially change total R&D investment. We believe our available cash and cash equivalents, together with our ability to generate operating cash flow and our access to short-term and long-term borrowings, are sufficient to fund our existing and planned capital requirements, and our management continuously evaluates liquidity and capital resources, including external capital access, to ensure adequate and efficient financing. In 2022 and early 2023, we committed to capital investments exceeding $2 billion in new facilities in Indiana, over $1 billion in North Carolina, â‚¬400 million in Ireland, and $450 million to expand parenteral filling, device assembly, and packaging capacity, underscoring resource reconfiguration and strategic foresight. To mitigate financial and operational risks, we employ a controlled risk management program that uses derivative financial instruments to limit the impact of interest-rate and currency fluctuations, convert a portion of fixed-rate debt to floating through interest-rate swaps, and hedge exposures to the euro, yen, and yuan via forwards and options, regularly analyzing fair values and sensitivities; we maintain off-balance sheet supply and service agreements that could require payments up to $4.5 billion if volume commitments are not met. We estimate rebates and discounts for managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, chargeback, and patient assistance programs based on historical payments, contract terms, and current sales trends to ensure accurate revenue recognition and preserve organizational integrity and performance under varying economic, regulatory, and public-health conditions.

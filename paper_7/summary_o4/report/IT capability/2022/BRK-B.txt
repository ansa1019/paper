Berkshire Hathaway’s management emphasizes business continuity and the preservation of positive performance under adversity by operating a highly diversified, decentralized group of businesses with “few centralized or integrated business functions” and by maintaining substantial liquidity in cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury bills, “insisting on safety over yield.”  The Company’s insurance operations strive to “produce pre-tax underwriting earnings … over the long term” and to absorb catastrophic shocks—recognizing that “the timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility” and deeming incurred losses above $150 million per event as significant—while responding to pandemic-related declines in driving by adjusting premiums, restoring “average claims frequencies” as conditions normalized, and obtaining rate increase approvals that support a projected underwriting profit in 2023.  Senior management retains ultimate responsibility for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of operating business leadership, reflecting both operational flexibility and a systemic perspective on resource deployment.  In its railroad operations, volume declines and higher fuel costs were substantially offset by “improved productivity” and negotiated labor agreements; its utilities and energy businesses adapt to regulatory environments by seeking recovery of operating costs through rate filings; and its manufacturing, service and retailing segments manage input cost inflation and supply-chain disruptions through price adjustments, operational cost control and asset impairment reviews.  Across all segments, Berkshire monitors market risks—equity price, interest rate, foreign currency and commodity exposures—eschews reliance on unrealized investment gains for performance assessment and maintains redundant liquidity to preserve system integrity and firm performance under internal or external variations and disturbances.

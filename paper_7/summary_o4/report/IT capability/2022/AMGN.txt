In 2022, Amgen continued providing uninterrupted supplies of its medicines globally through the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, taking appropriate steps to minimize risks to its employees—many of whom have continued to work virtually—and reporting that remote working arrangements “have not significantly affected our ability to maintain critical business operations, and we have not experienced disruptions to or shortages of our supply of medicines.” The company continuously monitors COVID-19 infection rates, works to mitigate effects on future study enrollment in clinical trials and evaluates impacts in all relevant countries, remaining focused on supporting active clinical sites in providing patient care and investigational drug supply. Amgen maintains a strategic and disciplined approach to capital allocation, supported by cash flows from operating activities of $9.7 billion, existing funds, marketable securities and access to financing, which it deems “adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements, our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock, and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities.” Risk mitigation strategies include hedging net foreign currency exposure through hedging activities and cross-currency swap contracts, maintaining specified minimum interest coverage ratios under its revolving credit, bridge credit and term loan agreements, and monitoring and adjusting accruals for rebates, chargebacks and other sales deductions based on contractual terms, statutory requirements, customer buying patterns and historical experience. Wholesaler inventories are “maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand,” thereby preserving supply chain continuity. Investment in human capital resource management is directed at attracting, motivating, developing and retaining talent “to tackle the challenges of running an enterprise,” and a diverse and inclusive culture is viewed as fostering innovation that supports the company’s ability to serve patients. Capital projects planned for 2023 include approximately $925 million in expenditures primarily to expand manufacturing capacity, while purchase obligations, operating leases and contingent milestone payments are managed through operational budgeting to preserve financial and operational flexibility. Amgen’s processes for evaluating impairment of long-lived and equity-method assets, determining deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuing contingent consideration obligations under acquisitions involve forecasting future cash flows, timing and cost estimates, probabilities of regulatory approvals and appropriate discount rates, thereby reinforcing its ability to maintain integrity and performance under both nominal and extreme conditions.

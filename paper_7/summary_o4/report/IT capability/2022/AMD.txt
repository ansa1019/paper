AMDâ€™s 2022 operations reflect the maintenance of performance under challenging conditions through strategic actions that absorb strain and preserve functioning, including the transformative acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando to diversify and strengthen the business model, expand adaptable hardware platforms, enter new markets, and provide the broadest set of leadership compute engines enabling security, flexibility, and total cost of ownership for data centers. Despite a weak PC market and significant inventory correction, net revenue grew 44 % driven by a 64 % increase in data center segment revenue, demonstrating positive adjustment under external pressures. To ensure business continuity and mitigate financial risks, AMD issued $1.0 billion of senior notes, established a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility, and initiated a commercial paper program, while maintaining $5.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments and belief in sufficient liquidity from operations and capital markets access. The company monitors supply-chain and public health developments related to COVID-19, works with suppliers on the timing of payments and deliveries to manage constraints, and aligns reporting segments with strategic end markets to enhance resource allocation and operational flexibility. Ongoing execution of its product technology roadmap with launches of next-generation processors, accelerators, and development kits supports resilience by enabling customers to reconfigure resources, optimize performance, and accelerate output under evolving conditions. Provisions for inventory valuation, revenue adjustments, goodwill, and intangible asset impairment reflect dynamic risk assessment and adaptation of accounting and operating parameters to preserve financial integrity in response to market and macroeconomic variations.

Applied Materials responded swiftly to the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing precautionary measures to protect employee health and safety across its global operations, ensuring compliance with governmental orders and supporting workplace flexibility to mitigate operational disruptions and maintain business continuity. In response to evolving conditions, the company adjusted its global operations in collaboration with employees, customers and suppliers and continues to manage supply chain constraints as a top priority to sustain its ability to ship products. Applied’s strategic priorities involve substantial investments in research, development and engineering to deliver innovative products and platforms ahead of strong demand, thereby preserving system integrity and supporting customer production requirements at technology inflections. The firm works closely with its global customers to design systems and processes that meet planned technical and production specifications, enabling adaptation to shifts in end-market drivers and maintaining operational flexibility. Applied manages financial resilience through diversified liquidity sources, including cash generated from operations, cash equivalents and investments, a committed revolving credit facility with SOFR-based borrowings, a commercial paper program backstopped by its credit facility, and disciplined cash deployment decisions such as stock repurchases and quarterly dividends, all while monitoring credit risk, managing accounts receivable through sale without recourse, and evaluating pension and postretirement funding obligations. The company continually assesses external pressures, including complex export regulations and macroeconomic uncertainties, pursuing necessary export licenses and authorizations, and reassessing its working capital, purchase obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements—such as standby letters of credit and guarantee instruments—to ensure sufficient resources and organizational agility to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning amid evolving challenges.

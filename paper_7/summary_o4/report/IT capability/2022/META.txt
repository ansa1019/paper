In managing our operations under challenging macroeconomic, regulatory, and geopolitical conditions, we have undertaken a variety of organizational resilience strategies—defined as the maintenance of positive adjustment and the ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity—including cost management initiatives such as facilities consolidation, the layoff of approximately 11,000 employees, pivoting our data center strategy with cancellation of multiple projects and $1.34 billion of abandonment charges, and extending the useful lives of servers and network assets to reduce depreciation expense by $860 million. To enhance business continuity and resource allocation, we supplement our GAAP financial statements with non-GAAP measures, including revenue on a constant currency basis and free cash flow, providing transparency for year-over-year comparison and enabling risk assessment amid foreign exchange volatility. In response to external pressures such as changes in mobile operating systems, privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), and shifts in customer demand, we have evolved our advertising systems by developing privacy-enhancing technologies, anonymized data approaches, and AI-powered delivery and measurement tools, while innovating new ad formats (e.g., Reels ads) and exploring open standards for secure data processing. We continuously invest in data center capacity, infrastructure, and headcount to support both our family of apps and Reality Labs long-term metaverse efforts, recognizing that these initiatives require balancing near-term profitability with strategic foresight and may involve sustained losses in Reality Labs to reconfigure trajectories toward future growth. We regularly evaluate trends in user engagement and advertising spend—acknowledging imperfect visibility and complex judgments—to adapt our product offerings in the face of competitive pressures, regional service restrictions due to the war in Ukraine, and pandemic-driven demand shifts. Through these strategic adaptations and resource reconfigurations, we strive to maintain system integrity and performance, support operational flexibility, and foster organizational health, ensuring our ability to respond effectively to disruptions and emerge stronger in a turbulent business environment.

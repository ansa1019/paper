Management’s Discussion and Analysis notes that the Company’s results are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described in Part I, Item 1A (Risk Factors), and includes forward‐looking statements made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 to provide a trajectory of responses to potential disruptive events. The Company demonstrates operational flexibility by increasing store count and selling square footage even amid COVID-19 related temporary store closures, returning to a fully open store base, and utilizing inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on merchandise purchases. It underscores its liquidity preparedness—holding $5.5 billion in cash, maintaining $1.5 billion of available credit facilities and monitoring debt financing markets—to ensure adequate resources to meet operating needs under varying market conditions, and dynamically allocates resources by repurchasing $2.3 billion of shares, repaying debt, and declaring dividends of $1.18 per share in fiscal 2023. Capital expenditures of $1.5 billion were directed toward new stores, store renovations and improvements, and office and distribution centers to support growth. The reported cost of sales and SG&A expense ratios reflect resilience investments in supply chain and incremental freight, higher markdowns and shrink expense, and adjustments to store payroll as COVID-related costs declined. Critical accounting estimates—such as the retail method for inventory valuation, mark-to-market adjustments on derivatives, reserves for uncertain tax positions and accruals for loss contingencies—illustrate measures to absorb strain, preserve integrity and maintain partial performance under internal and external variations and disturbances.

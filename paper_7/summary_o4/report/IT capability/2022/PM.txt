Since 2008, the Company has invested more than USD 10.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products, including the establishment of world-class pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research and post-market study capabilities, thereby enhancing its capacity to absorb strain and maintain performance amid industry disruption. In November 2022, the acquisition of an 85.87 percent controlling interest in Swedish Match AB created a global smoke-free combination integrating IQOS and ZYN brands, accelerating the transition of adult smokers to better alternatives and reconfiguring complementary portfolios to strengthen adaptive capability. To support the growth of the smoke-free business, reinforce consumer centricity and increase the speed of innovation and deployment, in January 2023 the Company reorganized from six geographic segments to four regions, realigning headquarters locations, streamlining decision-making and improving operational flexibility. Concurrently, the relocation of the corporate and Americas headquarters to Stamford, Connecticut in November 2022 reflects an organizational design optimization aimed at more efficient resource allocation. Beyond tobacco, the consolidation of Vectura Group plc and Fertin Pharma A/S into the Vectura Fertin Pharma subsidiary leverages life-sciences expertise to diversify into wellness and healthcare, expanding dynamic capabilities and resource generation for future growth. The development and commercialization of reduced-risk products—that present lower potential harm to smokers—and the proactive reclassification of certain combustible products into the smoke-free category demonstrate systemic perspective and risk mitigation in response to evolving consumer needs and regulatory environments. In response to the war in Ukraine, the Company prioritized employee safety by evacuating over 1 000 individuals, relocating more than 2 700 employees from high-risk zones, providing critical aid and continuing salary payments, while temporarily suspending operations in Ukraine, resuming retail activities where safe and rerouting supply through external production centers and contract manufacturing to preserve business continuity under extreme conditions. In Russia, the Company continues to support approximately 3 200 employees, maintaining salary payments while suspending planned investments, scaling down manufacturing operations, discontinuing product launches and marketing activities, and continuously assessing regulatory constraints to mitigate adverse impacts and uphold organizational integrity. A strategic agreement with Altria Group Inc. to terminate the IQOS U.S. commercialization relationship by April 30 2024, and for PMI to reacquire full rights effective May 1 2024 for USD 2.7 billion, secures long-term market positioning through centralized control of commercial operations. The fifteen-year exclusive collaboration with KT&G, announced January 30 2023, to commercialize smoke-free devices and consumables worldwide—excluding South Korea—with three-year performance review cycles and volume-based commitments, exemplifies inter-organizational collaboration and strategic agility in adapting to evolving market conditions. Organizational design optimization and product distribution restructuring in Switzerland and South Korea during 2021, which resulted in pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs, illustrate the Company’s willingness to curtail non-core activities and reallocate resources to reinforce resilience. Continued investments in research and development, including the in-process R&D acquisition charge for Otitopic, Inc.’s dry powder inhalation aspirin treatment, and employee retention programs within the wellness and healthcare segment, reflect a sustained focus on building core capabilities and organizational health to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

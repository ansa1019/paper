ServiceNow emphasizes that its Now Platform “seamlessly connects workflows across siloed organizations and systems in a way that unlocks productivity, improves experiences for both employees and customers and delivers real business outcomes,” enabling customers’ digital transformation “from non-integrated enterprise technology solutions with manual and disconnected processes and activities, to integrated enterprise technology solutions with automation and connected processes and activities,” and further notes that “the transformation to digital operations, enabled by the Now Platform, increases our customers' resiliency and security and delivers great experiences and additional value to their employees and consumers.” The company discloses that it is “closely monitoring the unfolding events of the Russian invasion of Ukraine” and acknowledges that if the conflict “continues or worsens, leading to greater global economic disruptions and uncertainty, our business and results of operations could be materially impacted.” ServiceNow highlights its strong liquidity and continuity capabilities, reporting positive operating cash flows for more than ten years and maintaining cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2022, which “are available to service our liabilities as well as our cancellable and non-cancellable arrangements” and are expected “to be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months.” To mitigate foreign currency exposure, the company “enters into foreign currency derivative contracts with maturities of 12 months or less to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities,” while recognizing that such hedges “may reduce, but cannot entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements.” Its business model of multi-year, generally non-cancelable subscription services, a renewal rate of 98% for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, and remaining performance obligations of $14 billion, of which 49% is expected to be recognized in the next 12 months, further illustrates ServiceNow’s ability to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions, and maintain performance amid external pressures and economic variability.

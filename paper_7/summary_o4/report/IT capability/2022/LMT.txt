Lockheed Martin has implemented a range of measures that collectively serve to enhance its organizational resilience, including accelerating $1.5 billion in supplier payments and deploying on-site resources to mitigate covid-19–related supply chain disruptions, actively engaging with customers to protect employee health and safety, and monitoring and adapting to ongoing risks. The company’s strategic approach emphasizes agility and adaptability—designing and integrating advanced open-architecture platforms to make forces more unpredictable, executing a multi-year digital infrastructure transformation to increase efficiencies and collaboration across its four business segments, and investing substantially in workforce technical skills. To preserve operational continuity and cost competitiveness amid inflationary pressures and fixed-price contract constraints, Lockheed Martin factors economic price adjustment clauses into new proposals and remains committed to improving affordability through ongoing efficiency efforts. Portfolio resilience is supported by continuous evaluation, including targeted acquisitions, divestitures and internal realignments, as well as the forging of strategic partnerships and joint ventures to reconfigure capabilities and strengthen market position. Liquidity management and financial flexibility are maintained through robust free cash flow generation, access to credit facilities, strategic debt issuances and the transfer of $4.3 billion of defined benefit pension obligations via group annuity contracts to reduce funding volatility. Rigorous contract risk-management processes identify and monitor technical, schedule and cost risks from inception to completion, leading to adjustments in profit-booking rates and reach-forward loss provisions when necessary. Furthermore, the company evaluates capacity and supply chain readiness in response to geopolitical conflicts, enhances its cyber defensive posture against evolving threats, and leverages cost-recovery provisions for environmental remediation to sustain performance integrity under challenging and exceptional conditions.

During fiscal 2022, management undertook strategic investments and operational adjustments to address ongoing global supply chain disruption, including promoting higher in-stock levels, pulling forward seasonal merchandise, and expanding new supply chain facilities, while also absorbing the loss of a store due to a fire amid the opening of six new locations, thereby preserving operational continuity under adverse conditions. The company generated $14.6 billion of net cash from operating activities, issued $6.9 billion of long-term debt, and held $2.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents, supported by a $5.0 billion commercial paper program and expanded backup credit facilities, which management believes will be sufficient to meet operating requirements, fund $3.1 billion of capital expenditures, $7.8 billion of dividends, and $6.7 billion of share repurchases, while maintaining the ability to secure alternative financing if necessary. A disciplined capital allocation framework prioritized reinvestment in the business, followed by dividends, with excess cash returned to shareholders through a $15.0 billion share repurchase authorization. The expansion of borrowing capacity, use of interest rate swaps for hedging, issuances of senior notes for general corporate purposes, and deployment of operating and finance leases to fund real estate assets illustrate ongoing risk-mitigation measures and resource reconfiguration to support resilience. Working capital management—driven by seasonality, inventory actions, vendor payment timing, and foreign-exchange fluctuations—further underpinned liquidity and adaptability, reflecting the company’s ability to maintain performance and preserve integrity in the face of internal and external variations.

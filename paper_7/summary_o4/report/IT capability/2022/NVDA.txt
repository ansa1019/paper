NVIDIA has adopted comprehensive supply chain and inventory management practices—including tracking inventory on hand, purchase obligations and prepaid supply agreements, and recording $2.17 billion of inventory provisions to write down excess inventory or commitments misaligned with demand—to preserve operational continuity and financial performance amid demand fluctuations and product transitions that often require simultaneous shipment and support of both new and legacy architectures. The Company recognizes that qualification times, customer anticipation of new products and channel inventory adjustments can introduce revenue volatility, and it applies judgment in forecasting demand and adjusting inventory commitments to mitigate such risks. In response to evolving global trade regulations, NVIDIA is reallocating research, development, supply and distribution operations out of China, engaging customers with alternative offerings and absorbing transition costs to maintain competitive position under new U.S. export license requirements. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company reopened offices worldwide, incurred incremental onsite service expenses, and managed supply chain and logistics constraints caused by lockdowns, acknowledging that future restrictions could exacerbate demand estimation challenges. NVIDIA’s strategic diversification across compute & networking, graphics, professional visualization and automotive markets—encompassing hyperscale AI cloud service agreements, omniverse platforms and autonomous vehicle SoC production—enhances its capacity to absorb external disturbances and sustain performance under pressure. Critical accounting judgments, such as placing noncancelable inventory orders based on demand forecasts and managing long manufacturing lead-times, reflect proactive risk mitigation and resource deployment. The Company maintains robust liquidity with $13.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, generated $5.6 billion of operating cash flow and has access to a $575 million commercial paper program, ensuring financial flexibility to meet supply obligations, fund $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion of capital investments in fiscal 2024, and return capital to shareholders under a $7.23 billion share repurchase authorization—demonstrating resilience through strategic financial planning, operational adaptability and resource reallocation in the face of market volatility, regulatory shifts and technological change.

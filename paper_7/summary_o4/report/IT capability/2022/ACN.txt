Management acknowledges significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty, including wage inflation and increased volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, which impact business resilience; in response, “we proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions,” hiring to meet current and projected future demand, evaluating voluntary attrition, adjusting levels of new hiring, using involuntary terminations and compensation adjustments to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance, and changing the mix of people and utilizing technology to offset higher labor costs. As a global company, “our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations,” so we “seek to manage foreign currency exposure … by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs.” We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities, with substantially all cash held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions on the free flow of funds and domestic cash inflows sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements. Our approach to revenue recognition—requiring judgments on performance obligations, whether satisfied over time or at a point in time, and measuring progress using costs incurred relative to total estimated costs—together with monitoring of variable consideration, incentives and penalties over the lives of contracts based on anticipated performance and historical experience, reflects an adaptive mechanism to handle contract complexity. We maintain commitments—$2.8 billion related to cloud hosting arrangements, software subscriptions and other noncancelable obligations—and indemnification arrangements with clients to support service continuity under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions, and utilize share repurchase programs—through open-market purchases, Rule 10b5-1 plans and other means—to allocate resources flexibly, subject to market conditions, cash balances and management discretion. These measures collectively illustrate our ability to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning, and adapt organizational configurations and processes in the face of internal and external variations and disturbances.

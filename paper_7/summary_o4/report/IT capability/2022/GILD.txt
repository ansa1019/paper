Management’s discussion and analysis is intended to provide material information around events and uncertainties known to management relevant to an assessment of the financial condition and results of operations, reflecting a systematic perspective on risk mitigation and business continuity. The company states that it continually evaluates its liquidity and capital resources, including access to external capital, to ensure that it can adequately and efficiently finance its operations and that its existing capital resources, supplemented by cash flows generated from operations, will be adequate to satisfy its capital needs for the foreseeable future. To address environmental perturbations and performance maintenance under varying exchange‐rate pressures, Gilead uses foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a portion of its foreign currency exposures. Its strategic priorities for 2023 and beyond emphasize maximizing near‐term revenue growth, expanding its core HIV and oncology portfolios, championing an environment of inclusion and employee growth, and removing barriers to speed in execution, thereby reinforcing operational flexibility and strategic agility. The company plans to provide consistent execution on a portfolio with quality, depth and breadth and continues to invest in its business and research and development pipeline through acquisitions and collaborations, including the reacquisition of trodelvy rights, strategic research collaboration agreements, and expansion of manufacturing capabilities, to ensure operational continuity and service innovation. A detailed discussion of material cash requirements, unconditional purchase obligations, capital expenditure projects and milestone payments related to collaborative agreements further underscores Gilead’s proactive resource allocation and preparedness to confront external pressures, preserve integrity and maintain performance under challenging conditions.

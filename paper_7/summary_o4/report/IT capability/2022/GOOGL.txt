Alphabet is focused on expanding its products and services to stay in front of evolving user behaviors and technology trends in order to maintain and grow its business, anticipating that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities and operating and financing cash flows will continue to be sufficient to fund its operating activities and cash commitments for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future; it continues to invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures, including servers, network equipment, data centers and other technical infrastructure to support the growth of its business and its long-term initiatives, and has entered into multi-year, non-cancellable commitments for licenses, technical infrastructure, inventory, network capacity and renewable energy to provide capacity for growth and underpin operational continuity; acquisitions and strategic investments, such as the September 2022 acquisition of Mandiant to expand offerings in dynamic cyber defense and response, contribute to the breadth and depth of its offerings, expand expertise in engineering and other functional areas and build strong partnerships around strategic initiatives; while it has a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, this program does not fully offset their effect on revenues and earnings, and it employs non-GAAP constant currency revenues to evaluate period-to-period comparisons by excluding foreign currency volatility that is not indicative of core operating results; it faces continuing changes in regulatory conditions, laws and public policies that could increase its cost of doing business, limit its ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services and require changes to its business practices, and it provides bank guarantees in lieu of cash payment for European Commission fines and records liabilities when losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated; operating expenses—particularly research and development investments and third-party service fees—support the development of new, innovative offerings and the improvement of existing offerings, and the company periodically assesses the useful lives of property and equipment, including servers and network equipment, to reflect changes in business operations and technological advancements; it maintains a short-term debt financing program and revolving credit facilities to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes and regularly evaluates its cash and capital structure, including the size, pace and form of capital return to stockholders, as evidenced by its April 2022 authorization and execution of up to $70 billion in share repurchases; and it prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, applies critical accounting estimates to fair value measurements of non-marketable equity securities and impairment evaluations, and evaluates uncertain tax positions and loss contingencies on an ongoing basis to reflect changes in facts and circumstances, thereby preserving the integrity of its financial reporting system under nominal to extreme conditions.

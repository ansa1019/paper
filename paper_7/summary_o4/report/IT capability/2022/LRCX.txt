Management’s discussion highlights the company’s efforts to absorb strain and preserve functioning under internal and external variations by building a strong global presence through core competencies in nanoscale applications enablement, chemistry, plasma and fluidics, advanced systems engineering and operational disciplines, sustaining engineering and product development programs, and a collaborative focus with semi-ecosystem partners; the customer support business group provides products and services to maximize installed equipment performance, predictability and operational efficiency; resource allocation to research and development and capital infrastructure is supported by maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves and anticipated cash flows, including $3.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and investments as of June 26, 2022, which are expected to support operations, investments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, capital redistributions and dividends through at least the next twelve months, and management believes it can access the capital markets on adequate terms if necessary. Management recognizes external pressures from demand inflections driven by cloud computing, IoT and market volatility, ongoing supply chain constraints, the COVID-19 pandemic and inflationary cost pressures, and reports supply chain improvements while expecting persistent shortages. Critical accounting policies and estimates—including the five-step revenue recognition process with fixed and variable consideration, inventory valuation with write-downs for obsolete or excess inventory based on market demand projections, warranty provisions adjusted for actual costs, impairment assessments of long-lived assets through qualitative and quantitative fair value tests, and evaluation of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions—reflect deliberate risk mitigation, reconfiguration of resources and adjustments to estimates to maintain system integrity, performance, and financial condition under nominal, extreme and exceptional conditions.

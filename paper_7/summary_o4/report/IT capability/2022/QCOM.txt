The discussion acknowledges that our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and highlights our need for operational flexibility and resource allocation to preserve business continuity amid seasonal fluctuations in consumer demand for wireless devices, device launch and innovation cycles, and the easing yet continuing pricing pressures from key semiconductor wafer suppliers. It describes how we have reconfigured our portfolio and strengthened our capabilities through strategic investments and the acquisition of Veoneer, and how we deploy financial resources—via multi-year capacity commitments, share repurchases, dividends, debt issuances and cash on hand—to maintain liquidity and support uninterrupted operations under adverse conditions, including macroeconomic headwinds, trade tensions, intense competition in China and pandemic-related impacts. The reversal of the 2018 EC fine and corresponding benefit recorded in other income illustrates our mitigation of external legal and regulatory shocks, while our management of working capital—through inventory valuation adjustments, accounts receivable fluctuations, and tax law changes requiring capitalization of R&D expenditures—demonstrates our systemic approach to risk assessment, preservation of performance and adaptation of financial structures. Additionally, our ongoing monitoring of legal, tax and marketable equity investment risks and the maintenance of our revolving credit and commercial paper programs underscore our commitment to absorb strain, maintain integrity and position the company to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and emerge stronger from exceptional challenges.

In its discussion of the business environment, Blackstone observes that “despite monetary policy tightening, economic growth, employment rates and consumer health indicators have demonstrated resilience,” noting U.S. real GDP growth of 2.1% in 2022, an unemployment rate that remained at 3.5%, and retail sales growth of 9.2% year-over-year—all indicators of the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The firm underscores its ability to absorb market perturbations and preserve operational continuity by organizing its activities into four distinct segments—real estate, private equity, credit & insurance and hedge fund solutions—and by generating revenue from a diversified mix of management, transaction and performance fees; by employing multiple sources of liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents, a €4.135 billion committed revolving credit facility and various senior note issuances; and by monitoring key operating and non-GAAP metrics such as distributable earnings, segment profitability, fee-earning assets under management and net accrued performance revenues to guide resource allocation, risk assessment and strategic initiatives. Blackstone further describes its systematic approach to managing investment realizations and unrealized valuations, crystallizing performance revenue, negotiating management fee offsets and allocating compensation in order to mitigate financial volatility, reconfigure capital deployment under shifting market conditions and sustain firm performance through evolving external pressures.

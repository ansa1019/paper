Schwab’s 2022 financial results reflected the resiliency of our diversified financial model in a challenging macroeconomic environment, with robust performance despite inflation, global economic concerns and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as clients continued to turn to Schwab for help in achieving their financial goals. Through these challenges, the company maintained a diligent approach to balance sheet management by preserving appropriate capital and liquidity to support client activity, limiting new portfolio investments to build available cash, utilizing short-term funding sources including FHLB advances and retail certificates of deposit, and enhancing technological infrastructure and workforce capacity to facilitate planned TD Ameritrade client transitions. During the TD Ameritrade integration we reconfigured our technology and service capabilities, incurred acquisition and integration-related costs and capital expenditures to reconstitute client account trajectories across multiple groups, and anticipate annualized cost synergies of $1.8 billion to $2.0 billion, adjusting plans in response to external pressures and market volatility. Our Board-approved enterprise risk management framework codifies the risk appetite that guides our strategy and embeds risk identification and assessment, risk response, risk measurement and monitoring, and risk reporting and escalation into daily operations, supported by periodic risk and control self-assessments, control testing and internal audit reviews, a well-established incident management program and routine business continuity and disaster recovery testing. Dedicated governance bodies oversee operational, compliance, credit, market and liquidity risks under formal policies and procedures for information security, fraud prevention, model governance, anti-money laundering, conduct, privacy, fiduciary obligations and incentive compensation oversight. To safeguard system integrity and performance maintenance under internal and external disturbances, we employ regular liquidity stress testing, capital stress testing, contingency funding plans, a comprehensive capital contingency plan for low-probability/high-impact events, and active management of interest‐rate sensitivity through portfolio composition and established limits on net interest revenue and economic value of equity.

Throughout 2022, Union Pacific maintained positive adjustment under challenging conditions by deploying a comprehensive safety management system—including its total safety culture, Courage to Care, Commit, and peer-to-peer programs—refining safety procedures based on CDC guidelines, adapting to evolving COVID-related risks, and enhancing proprietary software in its operating practices command center to enable proactive intervention and risk mitigation for derailments. In response to network congestion and increased demand, the railroad aggressively hired and graduated 1,302 train, engine, and yard employees, temporarily relocated personnel to high-need areas, added locomotives, and reduced freight car inventory, demonstrating resource reallocation and operational flexibility to preserve network fluidity despite deteriorating metrics. Fuel volatility was managed through robust fuel surcharge programs that generated $3.7 billion in 2022 and a 1 percent improvement in fuel consumption rate. The company continually evaluates its financial condition and liquidity—holding $973 million of cash and cash equivalents, undrawn credit facilities, and commercial paper capacity—to sustain operations under adverse scenarios. Its 2023 capital plan of approximately $3.6 billion prioritizes infrastructure hardening, asset modernization, and targeted investments to improve operational performance, handle increased volume with fewer critical resources, and reduce variability. Looking ahead, management will further deploy predictive technology, hazard identification and risk assessment strategies, and data analytics to detect rail defects, optimize crossings, and educate stakeholders, while striving to improve resource availability, service reliability, and operational continuity amid macroeconomic uncertainties.

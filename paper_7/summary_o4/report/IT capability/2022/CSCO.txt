In fiscal 2022, Cisco maintained positive adjustment under challenging conditions by delivering revenue growth and strong profitability in a challenging environment impacted by significant supply constraints, rising component and related costs, and the Russia-Ukraine war, and by continuing to operate in a challenging macroeconomic and highly competitive environment. The company assessed and reserved for the non-recoverability of substantially all of its assets in Russia and Belarus, recognized non-recurring charges to support impacted employees and severance and other exit-related costs, and executed a voluntary early retirement program to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas. To absorb strain and preserve operational continuity, Cisco took multiple steps in order to mitigate the component shortages and deliver products to customers, including partnering with several of its key suppliers utilizing its volume purchasing ability and extending supply coverage, paying significantly higher component and logistics costs to secure supply, modifying product designs to leverage alternate suppliers, and continually optimizing inventory build and customer delivery plans; as a result, the company increased its inventory balances, inventory purchase commitments, and inventory deposits and prepayments while recognizing the increased risks of excess and obsolete inventory. Simultaneously, Cisco continued to transition its business model toward increased software and subscriptions, accelerate innovation across its platforms in networking, security, collaboration, applications, and the cloud, and sustain strategic investments in research and development, all underpinned by forward-looking statements based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections, careful liquidity management through cash and available-for-sale debt investments, access to committed credit facilities, and a capital allocation strategy targeting dividends and share repurchases. These combined actions reflect a systemic perspective on risk assessment, resource reconfiguration, adaptability, and performance maintenance under both nominal and extreme disturbances.

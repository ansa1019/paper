Procter & Gamble highlights its ability to absorb strain and maintain or improve functioning under adverse conditions by successfully managing global financial risks such as foreign‐currency fluctuations, pricing controls and localized volatility, local, regional and global economic volatility, credit‐market disruptions and changes to its credit ratings, and by maintaining key manufacturing and supply arrangements—including supply‐chain optimizations and sole‐supplier and sole‐plant arrangements—to mitigate business disruption from natural disasters, acts of war or disease outbreaks. The company underscores its capacity to manage cost fluctuations and pressures in commodities, raw materials, labor, transportation, energy, pension and healthcare; its ability to stay on the leading edge of innovation, secure intellectual property protections and respond to evolving consumer habits, digital marketing and technological advances; and its effectiveness in competing on prices, promotional incentives, trade terms, customer relationships, reputation and brand equity. P&G further stresses its enterprise resilience through disciplined regulatory, legal and tax compliance, rigorous risk assessment of third-party relationships and technology systems, proactive environmental sustainability initiatives, and a steadfast approach to acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures that preserves core business objectives. The company pursues ongoing productivity improvements across cost of goods sold, marketing, overhead and capital spending to strengthen performance maintenance and resource reconfiguration, acts with agility and “constructively disrupts” its industry by reconfiguring how it innovates, communicates and leverages new technologies, and enhances organizational health and flexibility through clarified roles, accountability and incentive compensation. Finally, P&G has declared four strategic resilience focus areas—leveraging sustainability for product and packaging innovation, increasing digital acumen for rapid decision making, developing “next-level” supply-chain capabilities to enable flexibility, agility and resilience, and delivering a differentiated employee value proposition—to ensure the firm’s positive adjustment and performance under challenging and exceptional conditions.

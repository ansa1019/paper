In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates based on historical experience and reasonable factors, which we evaluate regularly and discuss with our audit committee to mitigate risks and maintain the integrity and performance of our reporting under varying internal and external pressures. We continuously monitor macroeconomic conditions—including the Russia-Ukraine war, the COVID-19 pandemic and central bank actions—and have taken adaptive measures such as halting new sales in affected regions, reducing our annualized recurring revenue accordingly, and using a foreign currency hedging program to preserve business continuity and operational flexibility. Our data-driven operating model, significant investments in research and development of cloud infrastructure, artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, and integrated on-premise and cloud-based services enable seamless cross-device workflows, resource reconfiguration and service innovation, thereby absorbing strain and sustaining functionality amid disruptive change. We strategically deploy resources through business combinations—such as the acquisitions of Frame.io and Workfront and the planned acquisition of Figma—using rigorous purchase price allocation processes and access to a revolving credit facility to ensure liquidity, reconstitute capabilities and foster long-term growth. In addition, we maintain cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, manage our debt maturity profile, and execute a structured stock repurchase program to return value to stockholders and minimize dilution, thereby reinforcing our ability to respond effectively to unexpected conditions and emerge stronger from adversity.

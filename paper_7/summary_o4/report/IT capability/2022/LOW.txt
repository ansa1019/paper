In fiscal 2022, we continued to adapt our operations and reinforce business continuity through strategic resource allocation and organizational change processes, exemplified by our total home strategy that integrates pro and DIY product and service offerings and the launch of the MVPs Pro Rewards and Partnership Program to deepen customer collaboration and service innovation. We enhanced operational flexibility and systemic resilience by expanding perpetual productivity improvement initiatives—upgrading labor management tools, store inventory systems and pricing capabilities—and by converting 11 geographic areas to a market-based delivery model that routes big and bulky products directly from our distribution network to customer homes. Concurrently, we invested $170 million in annual wage increases, alongside discretionary and profit-sharing bonuses, to strengthen human capital and organizational health at the front line. The sale of our Canadian retail business prompted a targeted transformation of our U.S. home improvement operations, simplifying our business model, improving operating margins and ensuring sustainable value creation under both nominal and exceptional conditions. To bolster our capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning amid external pressures, we issued $9.8 billion of unsecured notes, maintained $1.3 billion of cash and equivalents and $3.5 billion of undrawn credit capacity, and directed $1.8 billion of capital expenditures toward existing store enhancements, strategic initiatives for future performance and select new locations. We managed supply-chain fragmentation and transport cost inflation through network expansions and inventory controls, while our non-GAAP measures—adjusted diluted earnings per share and return on invested capital—exclude discrete impairment charges related to the Canadian business to transparently reflect core operating performance. We also maintain rigorous risk mitigation through periodic assessments of long-lived asset recoverability—employing income and market approaches to identify triggering events and measure fair value—and uphold self-insurance reserves based on actuarial loss estimates, thereby sustaining our adaptability, risk assessment and performance maintenance in the face of ongoing environmental disruptions.

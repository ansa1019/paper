The company emphasizes its capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity by maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions through diverse strategic, operational and financial measures. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the business remained resilient with sustained demand for advice and services, reflecting its operational flexibility and service innovation in the face of systemic perturbations. The deconsolidation of its Russian businesses in response to evolving economic sanctions, coupled with a definitive agreement to exit those operations and ongoing monitoring of global geopolitical uncertainty, demonstrates its adaptive risk mitigation and crisis response capabilities. Across its risk and insurance services and consulting segments, the company has invested in talent, technology rationalization, pricing strategies and client retention to support business continuity and competitive advantage, and has undertaken restructuring activities focused on workforce actions, functional service rationalization and real estate reductions to reconfigure resource deployment and generate projected cost savings. Its capital and liquidity management tools—including multi-currency revolving credit facilities, senior note issuances, commercial paper programs and share repurchases—ensure access to financial resources under varying conditions, while regular repatriation of non-U.S. earnings and pension funding policies reflect strategic foresight and resource generation for operational resilience. The company’s processes for revenue recognition, contingent consideration measurement, goodwill impairment assessments and detailed contingent payment obligations illustrate a systemic perspective on maintaining financial integrity and performance under internal and external variations, thereby underpinning its ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and emerge stronger from challenging situations.

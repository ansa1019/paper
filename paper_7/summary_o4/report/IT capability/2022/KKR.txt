The report repeatedly highlights the firm’s capacity to maintain operations and allocate resources under highly challenging and volatile conditions, noting for example that “global and regional economic conditions can each have substantial impact on our business … including the valuations of our investments, our ability to exit these investments profitably, our ability to raise capital from investors, and our ability to make new investments,” and acknowledging that “inflation presented a headwind … high rates and inflation began to put significant pressure on corporate profits and consumer balance sheets,” while “currency volatility can also affect our businesses and investments that deal in cross-border trade” and “labor disputes, shortages of material and skilled labor, work stoppages and increasing labor costs can also adversely impact us and the assets we manage.”  Notwithstanding these external pressures—“supply bottlenecks ranging from dynamic zero-COVID policy to shifting Russia-Ukraine supply chains … contributed to significant inflationary pressures”—the company observes that “despite various economic headwinds, several key economic indicators in the U.S., including employment, have demonstrated resilience in 2022.”  The firm’s risk mitigation practices are evident in its use of portfolio rotation and derivative hedges—“equity futures and equity index options … to hedge market risk in our variable annuity products,” and “interest rate contracts” to offset embedded guarantee exposures in insurance—while in its insurance operations it “intends to hold investments until recovery … as part of its asset-liability cash-flow matching strategy,” thereby preserving financial flexibility.  Management likewise relies on systematic performance and resource-deployment metrics—fee-related earnings from recurring revenues “not dependent on future realization events,” distributable operating earnings that inform strategic reinvestment decisions, and book value assessments to gauge unrealized asset strength—to sustain operational continuity and support adaptation of investment strategies during periods of extreme market perturbations.

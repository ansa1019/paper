Bank of America’s management framework explicitly integrates strategic planning, risk appetite and capital planning into its ongoing efforts to withstand and adapt to adverse conditions, continuously assessing “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” through capital buffers, stress capital buffers and countercyclical buffers to ensure resilience under both expected and severely adverse economic scenarios. A comprehensive risk framework under board oversight features clearly defined roles and responsibilities, redundant lines of defense and written enterprise policies that identify, measure, monitor and control strategic, credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance and reputational risks, thereby enabling the organization to preserve or improve its functioning despite internal or external variations and disturbances. The corporation conducts periodic capital scenario management and stress forecasting, including multilayered liquidity stress analyses and contingency funding plans, and maintains global liquidity sources and pledged collateral ready for deployment to meet contractual and contingent cash flow needs under a range of stressed conditions. An enterprise-wide IBOR transition program, climate risk framework and comprehensive compliance, operational and information security programs further reflect systemic perspectives on risk mitigation, adaptation to regulatory and environmental perturbations and maintenance of operational continuity. Lines of business, global risk management and corporate audit collaborate in proactive risk identification—drawing on internal and external knowledge, modeling and ongoing outcome analyses—to deploy resources, reconfigure exposures and recover from sudden disruptive change, while senior management and the board regularly review limit excesses, scenario impacts, recovery actions and contingency plans to preserve organizational strength, sustain competitive advantage and safeguard performance under pressure.

In 2022, the Company reported that “our operating results were robust and we ended the year in a solid financial position,” demonstrating its ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions including capital markets headwinds, ongoing inflation, steeply rising interest rates and the war and energy crisis in Europe. With operating portfolio occupancy at 98.2% and rent change on leases commenced during 2022 at 48.0% on a net effective basis, the Company preserved and improved functioning despite external pressures. Anticipating declines in asset valuations, management noted it “will continue to be disciplined as we evaluate capital deployment activities, including a focus on build-to-suit developments and a pause on contributions into our open-ended funds in the near term,” reflecting strategic resource allocation and operational flexibility. The Company affirmed it is “well-positioned to organically grow revenues given the increase in market rents over the last several years and our high lease mark-to-market,” while exercising caution in an uncertain environment. Capital expenditures increased year over year to renovate and modernize the operating portfolio, including sustainable and efficient building features, thereby supporting operational continuity and system integrity. Financing actions included terminating and entering new global credit facilities to extend maturities, upsizing aggregate borrowing capacity to $5.0 billion and maintaining $4.1 billion of available liquidity, supplemented by natural hedges through borrowing in local currencies to mitigate foreign currency risk. Strong credit ratings (A/A3) enabled advantageous interest rates, and the $23.2 billion Duke transaction—financed via equity issuance and the assumption of debt—followed by disciplined debt pay-down, illustrate the Company’s capacity to reconfigure trajectories in response to disruptive events. Through its owned and managed operating portfolio and strategic capital segment, the Company employs derivative instruments and equity method investments to absorb strain and preserve performance under external variations. The adoption of FFO and core FFO measures—excluding noncash depreciation, gains and losses on real estate transactions, tax and foreign currency effects—provides a systemic perspective on core operational performance, equipping management to foresee, confront and capitalize on sudden disruptive change while sustaining resilience.

Arista Networks underscores its organizational resilience through its ability to evolve and adapt to a rapidly changing environment by investing in research and development to enhance its cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features, and leverage the programmability of its EOS software to address workflow automation, network visibility, analytics and network detection and response, thereby sustaining performance under pressure; it continues to expand its sales force and marketing activities in key geographies and strengthen relationships with channel, technology and system-level partners to reach new customers more effectively, increase sales to existing customers and provide services and support to preserve operational continuity. We work closely with third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture our products and deliver them to fulfillment partners for labeling, final configuration, quality assurance testing and shipment, exemplifying a systemic approach to maintaining supply chain integrity. We continue to work closely with our contract manufacturers and supply chain partners to ramp production following a period of delayed component sourcing and workforce disruptions; we have funded additional working capital and incremental purchase commitments, and our demand planning horizon remains extended with high levels of purchase commitments and increased investments in working capital to address delays in component sourcing and the risk of future supply chain disruptions. Management continues to actively monitor the impact of macroeconomic uncertainties—including supply chain constraints, inflation, monetary policy shifts, recession risks, the COVID-19 pandemic and potential disruptions from the Russia-Ukraine conflict or U.S.–China trade tensions—on the company’s financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry and workforce, recognizing that any continued or renewed disruption in manufacturing and supply could negatively affect our ability to execute business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame. We believe our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and growth strategies for at least the next 12 months, although future capital requirements will depend on factors such as growth rate, research and development spending, sales and marketing expansion, supply chain activities, acquisitions, market acceptance of our products and stock repurchases; if we require additional capital and are unable to obtain it on acceptable terms, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected. Our operating cash-flows have also been and may continue to be negatively impacted by increased component inventories on hand or at our contract manufacturers awaiting scarce components necessary to build and ship completed products; accordingly, we record a liability and a corresponding charge for non-cancellable, non-returnable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers or suppliers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts, and we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and adequacy of our contract manufacturer and supplier liabilities to preserve system integrity and performance. Significant management judgments—such as forecasting customer demand, estimating standalone selling prices for revenue allocation across distinct performance obligations, valuing inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, and assessing uncertain tax positions and potential deferred tax liabilities—are employed to manage risk, maintain organizational coherence under internal and external pressures, and support sustainable firm performance.

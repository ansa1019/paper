The Company’s management acknowledges that the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental containment measures have disrupted its global workforce, manufacturing operations, suppliers and customers, leading it to modify business practices by restricting employee travel, adjusting work locations, cancelling physical meetings and implementing long-term contingency planning “to weather the current uncertainty.” It continuously manages business continuity and financial resilience by reviewing available funds held by foreign subsidiaries and the cost-effective access to those funds, maintaining highly liquid investments with high-credit-quality counterparties, diversifying cash holdings to minimize credit risk and ensuring that existing liquidity, internally generated cash flows and committed short- and long-term financing— including a $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility subject to consolidated leverage covenants—will fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development and potential dividends for at least the next twelve months. The Company actively assesses and hedges foreign currency and interest-rate exposures through forward contracts and sensitivity analyses to mitigate market risk, and it monitors compliance with debt covenants and contractual obligations to preserve operational flexibility. During fiscal 2022, the integration of the Maxim acquisition was executed through workforce realignment, property transitions via subleasing, impairment assessments of associated assets, severance and benefit actions, and the reconfiguration of engineering, sales, marketing and administrative activities to align its global operations with strategic objectives and support functional continuity. The Company also routinely evaluates property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill for impairment—using both qualitative and quantitative methods—to ensure the maintenance of system integrity and performance under varying economic and operational conditions.

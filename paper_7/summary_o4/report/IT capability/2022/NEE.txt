NEE and its subsidiaries have demonstrated resilience by maintaining business continuity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions through proactive liquidity and capital management, including the use of cash flows from operations, borrowings, equity issuances and revolving credit facilities to fund working capital, storm restoration and capital expenditures totaling $19.3 billion in generation, transmission, storage and other clean‐energy assets. In response to hurricane Ian and hurricane Nicole, FPL incurred and sought recovery of $1.3 billion in storm restoration costs under its regulatory cost‐recovery framework, applying reserve amortization provisions to preserve targeted returns. The company has monitored and mitigated solar supply chain disruptions from Southeast Asia to safeguard project development and construction activities, with no material operational impact to date. Strategic adaptation is further evidenced by acquisitions of GridLiance transmission utilities and renewable energy portfolios, the repowering and backlog expansion of wind and solar capacity, and the use of reserve and cost‐recovery mechanisms to manage earnings volatility. Through capital covenants, credit‐rating‐linked financing arrangements, contingent guarantees and letters of credit, NEE sustains a strong investment grade profile and manages market, counterparty and interest rate risks. Regulatory accounting treatment of assets and liabilities—such as nuclear decommissioning funds, reserve amortization, and deferred derivative fair‐value adjustments—supports the partial maintenance of system integrity and performance under both nominal and extreme conditions, while risk management policies and master netting agreements on derivatives underpin operational flexibility and the firm’s ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning in the face of environmental perturbations and market volatility.

Management states that while the COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts may continue to negatively affect performance to an extent, the company’s long-term fundamentals remain strong and it intends to manage through these challenges with strategic focus and the winning spirit of its global team. In 2022, the company experienced increases in cost and limited availability of raw materials, components and other inputs necessary to manufacture and distribute products due to constraints and inflation within the global supply chain, as well as increases in wage costs and the cost and time to distribute products, and expects similar macroeconomic and supply chain conditions in 2023. In the first quarter of 2022, the company reorganized its operational structure and aggregated its core businesses into two reportable segments to better align resources and improve operational flexibility. Under its 2019 restructuring plan, management committed to supply chain network optimization to maximize global manufacturing and distribution capacity and to build functional capabilities to support business growth, activities initiated in 2019 and substantially completed in 2022. The 2023 restructuring plan is intended to meet evolving global market demands by ensuring that the organization is structured and resourced to support strategic imperatives and deliver sustainable value, further building on the global supply chain optimization strategy through the transfer of production lines among facilities, optimization of functional capabilities, achievement of cost synergies and reinvestment of savings into strategic growth initiatives. Global supply chain disruption drove increased manufacturing and supply costs, which the company partially offset through gains on foreign currency hedging contracts. To mitigate financial risks, the company invests excess cash on hand in short-term financial instruments that earn market interest rates while mitigating principal risk through instrument and counterparty diversification and limits exposure to any one industry or issuer. Management believes that existing cash and cash equivalents, future cash generated from operations, access to capital markets and committed credit facilities will be sufficient to fund operations, infrastructure investments, legal liabilities, tax obligations, debt service and potential acquisitions. The company has established controls and procedures to escalate enterprise-level issues, including cybersecurity matters, to appropriate management levels and its board, with a crisis committee analyzing incidents for potential financial, operational and reputational risks and steps taken to understand readiness and enhance the resilience of critical business functions. Sustainability efforts include a commitment to carbon neutrality for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in manufacturing and key distribution sites by 2030, implementation of ISO 50001 and ISO 14001 energy and environmental management systems, a “C3” strategy of cutting energy use, converting to renewable sources and compensating with carbon offsets, and deployment of LEED-certified facilities, demonstrating systemic resilience in the company’s environmental footprint. Liquidity plans acknowledge macroeconomic and geopolitical risks, including inflationary pressures and international conflicts, and management remains vigilant to potential constraints on its ability to execute business plans. Through disclosure of non-GAAP adjusted measures and operational and organic net sales growth, management seeks to provide transparency into the operational decision-making processes and underlying performance metrics that drive resource allocation and strategic agility.

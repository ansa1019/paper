Throughout the period, management emphasized the Company’s capacity to absorb strain and preserve its core functions in the face of pandemic‐driven disruptions by scaling and evolving its molecular diagnostics solutions and consumables businesses to support COVID-19 testing, expanding biosciences and bioproduction capacity to meet global vaccine manufacturing needs and reconstituting its pharma services operations to deliver vaccines and therapies worldwide, while acknowledging the uncertain duration and extent of future pandemic‐related revenues. The Company has reconfigured its resource allocation through strategic growth investments—including commercial capability enhancements such as geographic sales reach expansion, e-commerce platform development, marketing initiatives, operational infrastructure expansion, research and development projects and employee incentive programs—and through practical process improvements under its PPI business system, global sourcing initiatives, headcount reductions and facility consolidations to drive productivity and resilience under inflationary pressures. Its proven growth strategy, grounded in the development of high-impact innovations, leverage of scale in high-growth and emerging markets and delivery of a unique customer value proposition, has been bolstered by targeted acquisitions that extend cell and gene therapy manufacturing, point-of-care molecular diagnostics, biologics production and clinical research services, thereby enhancing organizational flexibility, systemic capability and dynamic resource generation. Liquidity and capital resource management practices—including robust free cash flow generation, diversified debt facilities, non-U.S. cash deployment for capacity expansion and acquisition financing, and maintained revolving credit capacity to mitigate commercial paper market volatility—underscore the Company’s ability to respond adaptively to environmental perturbations, preserve operational continuity, manage risk exposures and pursue strategic initiatives to sustain firm performance and system integrity under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

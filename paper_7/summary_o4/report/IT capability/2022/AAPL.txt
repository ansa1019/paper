The discussion highlights the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global economic activity and financial markets, noting that certain outsourcing partners, component suppliers and logistical service providers have experienced disruptions resulting in supply shortages and warning that similar disruptions could occur in the future, while outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the company covering periods up to 150 days and the company maintains noncancelable manufacturing purchase obligations of $71.1 billion to support production continuity. The company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis, with separately managed reportable segments aligned to unique customer locations and market dynamics to adapt to foreign currency fluctuations and demand shifts. In April 2022, it increased its program authorization from $315 billion to $405 billion, raised its quarterly dividend, repurchased $90.2 billion of common stock and paid $14.8 billion in dividends and dividend equivalents, reflecting strategic agility in capital return and resource deployment. The company believes its $156.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, together with ongoing operational cash flows and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to meet cash requirements and its capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. Investments in research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses increased due primarily to headcount-related expenses and program costs, underscoring resource allocation toward innovation and organizational capabilities. Lease arrangements for corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space as well as other purchase obligations for capital assets and internet services further demonstrate commitments to operational continuity. Managementâ€™s preparation of financial statements and related disclosures relies on critical accounting estimates based on historical experience and various assumptions, forming the basis for judgments about asset and liability valuations, while provisions for uncertain tax positions and legal contingencies incorporate significant judgment and risk assessment to address potential material impacts on financial condition and operating results. The company also cautions that future gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure from product and services mix as well as foreign currency movements, illustrating its anticipation of variability and proactive monitoring of factors that could affect performance under pressure.

The Company’s MD&A describes how its results of operations are affected by macroeconomic conditions, including significant volatility and geopolitical uncertainty, and how management “continues to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions,” including through “currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs” and by adjusting pricing and “the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin.” To sustain operational continuity and preserve functioning under pressure, the Company “proactively plan[s] and manage[s] the size and composition of our workforce and take[s] actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions,” evaluating voluntary attrition, adjusting hiring levels and compensation in skill sets and geographies and, when necessary, using involuntary terminations to keep the supply of skills aligned with client demand. In outsourcing engagements, it defers transition costs “related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems,” which are “protected in the event of early termination of the contract” and “monitored regularly for impairment,” and allocates revenue across “multiple deliverables” based on relative selling prices to ensure performance maintenance and risk mitigation. The Company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning is further highlighted by its global delivery network and use of lower cost resources to assist clients in transforming their operations, delivering cost savings and operational efficiency and “deploying skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis” to respond to changing client needs. Revenue recognition policies employ the percentage-of-completion method, continuous evaluation of estimates and timely loss provisions when “a contract loss will occur,” reflecting judgment, forward-looking assessment of contract performance and mitigation of potential losses. Liquidity and capital resources management relies on cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity under credit facilities to support working capital and investment needs, while strategic actions such as share repurchase programs and acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies demonstrate dynamic resource allocation and reconfiguration strategies designed to maintain integrity and emerge stronger from challenging situations.

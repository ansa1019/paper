Amgen’s 2016 disclosures describe a multi-faceted approach to sustaining performance under internal and external pressures, including the execution of transformation and process-improvement initiatives begun in 2014 that have generated approximately $1.2 billion of savings and are being reinvested in product launches, clinical programs and external business development, the adoption of a more agile and efficient operating model to fund its innovative pipeline, and the commitment of most remaining transformation costs through 2017 to support these efforts. The company invested in next-generation biomanufacturing, such as its new Singapore facility, to reduce scale and cost while preserving a reliable, high-quality, compliant supply of medicines, continued to innovate with patient- and provider-friendly delivery systems like the Repatha® Pushtronex™ system and the Neulasta® Onpro® kit in response to evolving customer needs, and expanded its global presence with 94 country product launches to diversify revenue streams. Financial risk-mitigation measures included foreign-currency hedging programs designed to offset exchange-rate impacts on net income, substantial cash flows from operating activities that enabled continued capital allocation to dividends, share repurchases and debt service, and a disciplined liquidity strategy leveraging marketable securities, commercial paper, revolving credit facilities and access to debt markets. Forward-looking statements acknowledge intensifying competition, pricing and regulatory scrutiny and the need to develop new products to offset patent expirations, reflecting organizational foresight, resource reallocation and operational flexibility aimed at preserving integrity and performance—and emerging stronger—from disruptive change.

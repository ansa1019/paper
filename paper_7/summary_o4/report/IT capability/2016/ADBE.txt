Management regularly evaluates its assumptions, judgments and estimates—based on historical experience and various factors deemed reasonable under the circumstances—and discusses them with the Audit Committee, recognizing that actual results could differ materially under different assumptions or conditions. In response to evolving customer and market expectations, we frequently expand and improve our technology to keep pace with change, providing enhancements to our tools to meet industry needs and support customers at each stage of their life cycle, and our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to increase revenue through a lower cost of entry, additional features and value, and a recurring, predictable revenue stream recognized ratably. Adoption of Creative Cloud has transformed our business model by enabling us to expand our customer base and drive long‐term revenue growth, while our marketplace integration—for example, the acquisition and integration of Fotolia into our Digital Media segment and TubeMogul into Digital Marketing—demonstrates our capacity to absorb new operations, reconstitute processes, allocate resources and pursue sustained demand across our portfolio. We believe that investments in research and development, including recruiting and hiring software developers, are critical to remain competitive and directly related to the timely development of new and enhanced offerings, and we will continue to focus on long‐term opportunities and make significant investments in our subscription and service offerings. We also employ a currency hedging program to mitigate foreign‐currency impacts on revenue, have entered into interest rate swaps to manage borrowing costs on our senior notes and maintain a $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility; based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe our cash, cash equivalents, investments, anticipated cash flows from operations and available credit will be sufficient to meet working capital and operating requirements for the next twelve months. We monitor backlog and unbilled deferred revenue backlog—recognizing that contract timing, billing cycles, renewals and foreign‐currency fluctuations may affect future billings and revenue—and view these items as subject to change based on customer financial circumstances. In evaluating goodwill impairment, we consider whether events or changes in circumstances—such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in management or strategy, or shifts in customer behavior—indicate fair values have declined below carrying values, and we reconfigure our qualitative and quantitative analyses, estimating future revenue, market factors and cash flows, to determine if impairment is required. In business combinations, we allocate purchase price to acquired tangible and intangible assets based upon estimated fair values, requiring significant estimates and assumptions about future cash flows, development costs, trade names and trademarks, discount rates and deferred revenue obligations, and we acknowledge that unanticipated events may affect the accuracy of these assumptions. We maintain reserves for income taxes, regularly assess the adequacy of our provisions in light of ongoing tax examinations and changing laws or interpretations, and recognize that fluctuations in tax rates and regulations across jurisdictions could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in additional costs. Finally, we utilize structured stock repurchase agreements to return value to our stockholders by repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount when the expected discount exceeds the foregone return on our cash prepayments, and we believe such actions support our strategic flexibility and financial resilience under varying market conditions.

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies, and on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates—including those related to revenue recognition, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, cash equivalents and marketable securities, stock-based compensation, and litigation, investigation and settlement costs—based on historical experience and various assumptions believed reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values and exposures. Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, failure to estimate customer demand properly or unexpected competitive pricing actions; in addition, cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory, and we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to such cancellations or deferrals. We manage our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities under an investment policy requiring high-grade instruments, diversification of asset types and limits on portfolio duration, and we believe our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated by operations, and although repatriation of foreign earnings for U.S. cash requirements would give rise to federal and state tax, we have access to external sources of financing, including a $575 million revolving credit facility for working capital and general corporate purposes, to preserve our financial flexibility. Since December 2013, we have managed our convertible notes through early conversions and repayments, employing U.S. cash to settle principal and anticipating the use of proceeds from our September 2016 note issuances to prefund future repayments and for general corporate purposes such as dividends and share repurchases; during fiscal 2017 we returned $1 billion to shareholders by repurchases and dividends and plan to return approximately $1.25 billion in fiscal 2018 under an extended repurchase program. We are constructing a new headquarters under a build-to-suit operating lease with up to $380 million of bank funding, again illustrating our approach to balancing capital commitments with operational continuity. If information becomes available indicating that a loss in any pending litigation, investigation or settlement is probable and reasonably estimable, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and we recognize current and deferred tax assets and liabilities based on estimates of future tax effects, recording valuation allowances for benefits not expected to be realized. In our product development and business operations, we have introduced new platforms and collaborations—with Microsoft, the National Cancer Institute, the U.S. Department of Energy and numerous automotive, gaming and cloud partners—to support our ability to absorb strain, manage external pressures and preserve or improve performance in the face of technological, market and regulatory disturbances.

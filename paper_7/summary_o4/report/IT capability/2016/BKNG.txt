We evaluate our results on both an as-reported and a constant-currency basis by converting non-U.S. dollar transactions using prior-year average exchange rates rather than current-year rates to isolate and mitigate the effects of currency fluctuations, and we enter into short-term derivative contracts to minimize the impact of translation changes on our consolidated operating results.  Our strategy to help people experience the world relies on six independently managed brands and continuous investment in building accommodation supply, content and distribution and improving the consumer experience on desktop and mobile platforms, thereby allocating resources to foster operational flexibility and service innovation in response to evolving customer needs and competitive pressures.  We have shifted a growing portion of transactions to our merchant model—where we process payments on behalf of customers—to extend flexible payment terms and broaden the range of accommodations we offer, accepting the associated payment processing costs in exchange for resilience in our gross bookings growth and customer retention.  To support long-term operating results, we intend to continue investing in marketing and promotion, technology and personnel even when such expenditures pressure near-term operating margins, thereby accepting temporary reductions in profitability in order to preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions.  Our treasury management focuses on maintaining substantial liquidity, with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $13.9 billion as of December 31, 2016, the majority held outside the United States and intended to be indefinitely reinvested, supplemented by a $2 billion revolving credit facility to ensure business continuity under unexpected circumstances.  We actively monitor macro-economic, geopolitical and health-related risks—including slow or negative growth, Brexit, sovereign debt concerns, currency volatility, terrorist attacks, natural disasters and pandemics—and maintain contingencies in our risk factors and forward-looking statements, recognizing that such external disturbances may cause volatility in transaction growth, cancellation rates and consumer behavior.  Competition from both online and traditional providers and rapid shifts to mobile platforms demand that we continuously adapt our performance and brand advertising strategies, even as we contend with decreasing returns on investment, in order to sustain traffic and market share.  Following our acquisition of OpenTable, we revised the post-acquisition growth strategy to pursue international expansion and other initiatives in a more measured and deliberate manner, updating our forecasts to reflect reduced long-term projections partially offset by improved near-term margins, and recording a goodwill impairment when updated cash-flow expectations indicated diminished fair value—a recalibration of our organizational response to unexpected outcomes.  We routinely evaluate strategic alternatives, including mergers and acquisitions, exemplified by our plan to acquire Momondo, and we reconfigure our operating model by expanding merchant transactions, adjusting platform features and diversifying revenue streams to preserve system integrity and maintain performance under pressure.  Our accounting policies require complex judgments—such as estimating the probable outcome of performance-based equity awards, assessing recoverability of goodwill and other long-lived assets, determining valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and recording allowances for travel transaction taxes—underscoring our emphasis on risk mitigation, adaptability and reconstituting financial trajectories toward the future.  We manage seasonal timing differences between advertising expense and revenue recognition to smooth operating results, and we deploy operational and financial resources dynamically to absorb strain from merchant transactions and preserve liquidity.  Throughout, we maintain a formal governance framework for forward-looking statements, risk disclosures and compliance with tax and competition regulations, reflecting our systemic perspective and commitment to organizational resilience through positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

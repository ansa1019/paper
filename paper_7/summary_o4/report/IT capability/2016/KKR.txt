KKR recognizes that broad market and economic forces beyond its control can materially affect the value and performance of its investments, its ability to exit holdings profitably and to deploy new capital. Periods of volatility and dislocation in the capital and credit markets present substantial risks, but also can create investment opportunities at reduced valuations that position the firm for future growth. The firm’s long-term investment horizon and the variability of capital deployment on a quarterly basis reflect operational flexibility and the capacity to adjust resource allocation under varying market conditions. Maintaining and growing revenues depends on the ability to attract new capital and investors, to execute attractive investments amid competition, high valuations and rising credit costs, and to realize investments through strategic exits or dividends. Although slowing global growth, currency volatility and changing interest rates may impair asset values and returns, they may also provide opportunities to invest at more attractive U.S. dollar prices in select regions. The fair value of private equity, credit and real assets investments is driven by global financial markets, and fluctuations therein directly influence recognized net gains or losses, carried interest accruals and distributable earnings, reflecting the firm’s ongoing adaptation and risk mitigation across its investment strategies.

Most of the services we provide are necessary for our clients to operate their businesses and are, therefore, non-discretionary in nature, with the majority of our revenue generated from recurring account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years and high renewal rates; we also offer fraud and risk management products and services designed to help clients mitigate exposures and maintain business continuity. We continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives—including active portfolio management of our businesses, enhancing the overall value of existing client relationships, improving operational effectiveness, disciplined allocation of capital, and differentiating our products and services through innovation—to enhance operational flexibility, resource reconfiguration and service innovation in response to a rapidly evolving and competitive environment. We anticipate that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information, maintain regulatory compliance and offer innovative new services, and we believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks necessary to be competitive are essential to justify these investments. We believe that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with our position as a leading provider of non-discretionary, recurring-revenue products and services, gives us a solid foundation for growth and that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition that supports clients’ ability to adapt to regulatory conditions, cybersecurity scrutiny and other external pressures. From a resource management perspective, our current policy is to use operating cash flow primarily to fund capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions and to repay debt rather than to pay dividends, and to maintain access to our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility and term loan to satisfy liquidity needs for operating expenses, debt service and capital commitments; we believe this approach to capital allocation and our disciplined review of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment reflect our ability to absorb strain, preserve performance and adjust proactively under challenging or unexpected conditions.

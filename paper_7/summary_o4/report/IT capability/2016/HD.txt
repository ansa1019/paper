Since the data breach we discovered in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we have recorded $198 million of pretax net expenses related to the breach and maintain network security and privacy liability insurance coverage to limit our exposure to losses from a significant compromise of our data security, reflecting our risk mitigation and crisis management capabilities; in fiscal 2016, we continued to invest in our interconnected capabilities and to blend our physical and digital assets in a seamless and frictionless way—completing the deployment of our new COM platform, rolling out our BODFS program and enabling a dynamic ETA feature for online orders—to absorb strain, preserve functioning and improve customer satisfaction under varying conditions; through disciplined capital allocation and continuous operational improvement in our stores and supply chain, advanced by our multi-year Project Sync program, we reduced supplier-to-shelf lead times, lowered transportation expenses and improved inventory turns, reconfiguring end-to-end processes to enhance operational flexibility; the $1.7 billion acquisition of Interline in August 2015 established a platform in the MRO market through inter-organizational collaboration to serve institutional customers; we generated $9.8 billion of cash flow from operations, issued $5.0 billion of long-term debt and $360 million of short-term borrowings, and maintained $2.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents along with $2.0 billion of commercial paper capacity and a $2.0 billion backup credit facility to ensure liquidity and business continuity; we manage market risk through interest rate swap agreements, resulting in 93% fixed-rate debt, and monitor foreign currency exposure to preserve financial resilience; we establish self-insured liabilities for general liability, workers’ compensation, medical and automobile claims and record vendor allowances and advertising co-op incentives to refine cost of sales and SG&A, while quarterly impairment assessments of long-lived assets and annual goodwill tests based on discounted future cash flows ensure maintenance of asset integrity, collectively demonstrating our capacity to absorb adversity, adapt to external pressures and sustain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

NEE’s management employs adjusted earnings—excluding unrealized mark-to-market effects of non-qualifying hedges and OTTI losses—to smooth earnings volatility and provide a more meaningful representation of fundamental operating performance for financial planning, board reporting and performance-based compensation, thereby preserving operational continuity under market fluctuations; at FPL, substantially all changes in the fair value of energy derivatives are deferred as regulatory assets until contract settlement and passed through the fuel clause, supporting cost recovery and rate stability in the face of fuel price and demand variability, while FPL’s securitized storm-recovery costs, storm fund and storm reserve, together with associated restricted liquidity investments, ensure the ability to absorb and fund hurricane-related operational disruptions without impairing service; the enterprise maintains committed bank revolving credit facilities, variable-rate bilateral term loans and shelf registration programs to secure liquidity for working capital, capital expenditures—including continued investments in plant in service, transmission and distribution additions, new wind, solar and natural gas pipeline projects—and acquisitions such as the Cedar Bay and Indiantown generation facilities, thereby sustaining financial flexibility and growth under adverse conditions; strategic reconfigurations—such as the sales of interests in natural gas generation facilities and of wind and solar projects to NEE Partners and revaluations of contingent consideration on pipeline acquisitions—demonstrate adaptive resource allocation to emerging opportunities while containing earnings impacts; NEE’s market-risk governance, through an Exposure Management Committee, Value-at-Risk analyses for trading and hedging portfolios and robust credit policies using collateral, netting and credit limits, mitigates counterparty and commodity price risks; regulatory mechanisms—including base rates with cost recovery clauses, reserve amortization under FPSC rate agreements and the advance funding of nuclear decommissioning obligations—reflect a systemic perspective on maintaining integrity and performance under internal and external perturbations; pension plan assets are invested and valued using market-related methods and actuarial assumptions to smooth net periodic costs and ensure benefit security; rigorous debt covenant compliance, credit-rating oversight and replacement capital covenants maintain access to capital markets; and detailed contractual commitments, asset retirement obligations and guarantee arrangements for purchased power, pipeline development and decommissioning establish anticipatory risk management and resource support systems that enable the organization to preserve or improve functioning despite regulatory, environmental and market challenges.

Bank of America 2016 describes organizational resilience in practice through a comprehensive risk management framework that “enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders” by embedding “strategic risk … in every business” and establishing a formal “risk appetite statement” that guides capital and liquidity planning. The corporation “employs a risk management process, referred to as identify, measure, monitor and control (IMMC)” to continuously adjust its balance sheet and business strategies, while “conducting capital scenario management and forecasting on a periodic basis to better understand balance sheet, earnings and capital sensitivities to … conditions that are more severe than anticipated.” In its liquidity framework, the bank maintains “liquidity buffer, referred to as global liquidity sources (GLS), … even during stressed market conditions,” and its “primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet all contractual and contingent financial obligations at all times, including during periods of stress.” In addition, the firm “maintains contingency funding plans … and a recovery plan … to increase capital, access funding sources and reduce risk through consideration of potential options.” Oversight by executive management and the board of directors, including the Management Risk Committee, ensures that operational risk, “the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events,” and “compliance risk … legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to the reputation of the corporation” are proactively managed. Through regular stress testing, governance, defined limits and capital allocation across its lines of business, Bank of America preserves and improves functioning under “challenging conditions,” evidencing its resilience capabilities.

We closely monitor the results of our discovery, research, clinical trials and nonclinical studies and frequently evaluate our drug development programs in light of new data and scientific, business and commercial insights, with the objective of balancing risk and potential, a process that can result in abrupt changes in focus and priorities as new information becomes available. We have established a corporate compliance program designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems and through the promotion of a culture of compliance. We dedicate substantial management and other resources in order to obtain and maintain appropriate levels of reimbursement for our products from third-party payors, and recognize our ex-U.S. reimbursement discussions may take a significant period of time. To enable business continuity and financial flexibility, we intend to rely on our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash flows from product sales as our primary source of liquidity, and we will manage our capital structure and consider all financing opportunities, including our revolving credit agreement, although there can be no assurance such opportunities will be available on acceptable terms. During 2016 we maintained a substantial and consistent investment in internal research and development and instituted accrual processes requiring significant estimates and judgments to ensure appropriate resource allocation for our clinical programs, and we capitalize inventories of product candidate drug supplies when regulatory approval is considered highly probable, performing periodic recoverability assessments and writing down excess and obsolete inventories when identified. We recognize that regulatory authorities retain substantial discretion to delay, limit or deny approval, which could harm our financial results and commercial prospects, and that collaborative and in-license arrangements require assumptions to value milestone and royalty payment obligations, the fair value of which we remeasure quarterly to reflect event-driven changes. This coordinated set of policies and practices is intended to enhance our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite regulatory, operational and market adversities.

The annual report highlights the firm’s business continuity plan, information security program, risk management and liquidity policies, as well as its resolution plan and strategy for orderly resolution, as key components of its capacity to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. It describes a comprehensive liquidity risk management framework based on semi-annual balance sheet planning, maintenance of global core liquid assets to pre-fund modeled cash and collateral outflows under intraday, 30-day and longer-term stress scenarios, and a contingency funding plan detailing risk factors, metrics and crisis communication protocols. The firm sets firmwide, business and product limits for liquidity, market and credit exposures, conducts CCAR, DFAST and internally designed stress tests, and maintains a contingency capital plan identifying potential capital deficiencies and mitigants. Resolution and recovery plans required by regulators further support rapid and orderly restructuring, reflecting a systemic perspective on preserving integrity and performance under variations and disturbances. Governance of these resilience strategies is provided by board and senior management committees—including the risk committee of the board, firmwide risk committee, risk governance committee, firmwide model risk control committee, firmwide operational risk committee, and global business resilience committee—each overseeing policy frameworks, scenario analysis methodologies, valuation and model risk controls, operational risk policies and self-assessments, and market-making and credit risk reviews. Credit risk management conducts annual counterparty reviews, assigns internal credit ratings, measures current and potential exposures and employs netting, collateral arrangements and economic hedges; market risk management uses historical VAR, sensitivity measures and scenario analyses to monitor and hedge exposures; operational risk management employs event‐tracking, self‐assessments, scenario analyses and independent audits to minimize losses from process, system and human failures; and model risk management provides independent review and validation of valuation and risk models. Collectively, these processes, controls and governance structures enable the firm to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning despite adversity, adapt to evolving conditions and reconfigure its trajectories toward the future.

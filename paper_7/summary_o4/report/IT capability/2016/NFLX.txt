Netflix’s management discusses how the company absorbs strain and preserves or improves functioning despite adversity by expanding and focusing on Netflix as a global internet TV network, growing paid streaming memberships by 25 percent in 2016, phasing out grandfathered pricing and adjusting plan mix and price changes to maintain revenue growth in the face of unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations. Resource allocation to content acquisition, licensing and production—particularly in exclusive and original programming—requires significant upfront cash payments, which are capitalized and amortized based on historical and estimated viewing patterns, with periodic review and changes to amortization methods reflecting an adaptive approach to internal and external perturbations. To sustain operating flexibility and business continuity, Netflix has built its own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) and scaled cloud-computing infrastructure, supported by increased marketing programs and personnel to address the demands of new international territories and volatile market conditions. The company manages liquidity and financial resilience through cash flows from operations, strategic debt issuances and access to financing, currently sufficient to meet cash needs for at least twelve months despite $14.5 billion of multi-year content obligations, while regularly assessing foreign exchange, contractual purchase obligations, tax liabilities and other risks to ensure partial maintenance of performance and integrity under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

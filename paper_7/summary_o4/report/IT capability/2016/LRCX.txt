Management’s discussion emphasizes that the semiconductor capital equipment industry has been highly competitive and characterized by rapid changes in demand, with cyclicality mitigated in recent years by market demands and consolidation among customers, and that, with a reduced number of customers, variability in their business plans leads to changes in demand for the Company’s equipment and services. During fiscal year 2016, demand improved as semiconductor device manufacturers, particularly non-volatile memory customers, made capacity and technology investments, and technology inflections such as 3D NAND, multiple patterning, FinFET and advanced packaging expanded the Company’s served addressable market for deposition and etch products, supporting its longer-term growth expectations and continued market share gains. The Company leverages its expertise in semiconductor processing to develop productivity solutions that enhance yields, lower defect rates and reduce customer costs, reflecting an emphasis on operational adaptability and innovation. Operating expenses increased primarily due to continued investments in research and development and increased employee headcount, including significant R&D outlays focused on leading-edge deposition, plasma etch, single-wafer clean and other semiconductor manufacturing requirements. Management further underscores that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustained investment in R&D and capital infrastructure in a historically cyclical environment and to provide resilience for anticipated operations, investments, debt service requirements and capital expenditures, while noting that access to capital markets, though expected to be adequate, cannot be assured on favorable terms under all market conditions. The discussion also makes clear that forward-looking statements regarding financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition, highlighting the Company’s ongoing need for risk assessment, resource allocation and strategic flexibility in responding to external pressures and disruptions.

Operating margin expansion in fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by sales leverage and lower commodity costs, partially offset by investments in partners (employees) and digital platforms, reflecting disciplined resource allocation to maintain performance under cost pressures. The company actively manages cash and investments—including $3.4 billion in cash and marketable securities, a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, and a $1 billion commercial paper program—to fund operating needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and shareholder returns, thereby ensuring business continuity and financial flexibility. Planned capital expenditures of $1.6 billion in fiscal 2017 for new stores, renovations, systems and technology investments underscore Starbucks’s future orientation and adaptability. Pricing features embedded in supply contracts and the use of financial derivatives to hedge commodity price volatility for green coffee, dairy and foreign currency exposures illustrate a market price risk management policy that limits risk and supports operational continuity. Management evaluates property, plant and equipment and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment using discounted cash flow models and qualitative assessments, enabling adaptive reconfiguration of assets under changing economic conditions. Contractual obligations—comprising $7.3 billion of operating lease commitments, $3.6 billion of debt principal, $932 million of interest, $1.2 billion of purchase commitments and $183 million of other obligations—are expected to be funded primarily through operating cash flows, demonstrating Starbucks’s ability to preserve integrity and performance amid internal and external pressures.

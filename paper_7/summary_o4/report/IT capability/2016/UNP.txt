In 2016, the company continued its focus on safety to reduce risk and eliminate incidents for employees, customers and the public, achieving its best ever reportable personal injury incidents per 200,000 employee-hours and improving its derailment incident rate by 3%, and further engaging the workforce through programs such as Courage to Care, Total Safety Culture, and UP Way (our continuous improvement culture). Core pricing gains, productivity initiatives, and efficient network operations partially offset lower volumes, and improvements in service metrics—namely a 5% increase in average train speed and a 4% decrease in average terminal dwell time—reflected the impact of lower volumes and improved network fluidity. Looking forward, management will continue employing a multi-faceted approach to safety utilizing technology, risk assessment, training and employee engagement, quality control, and targeted capital investments, expand the deployment of safety culture programs to identify and implement best practices, and align resources with customer demand to maintain an efficient network and ensure surge capability. The annual capital plan remains critical to the long-term strategic plan, focusing 65% to 75% of investments on renewing and improving existing track infrastructure, enhancing network efficiency through facility and track improvements, and making technology and equipment investments, including positive train control and new locomotives, intermodal containers, chassis, and freight cars, to meet customer needs and support opportunities for growth. Liquidity and capital resources are managed through cash from operations, a $1.7 billion revolving credit facility, a $650 million receivables securitization facility, access to commercial paper, bank loans, and bond issuances, with close monitoring of debt-to-net-worth covenants and bond ratings to preserve access to capital markets. The company continually performs environmental assessments on properties with potential remediation obligations, accrues costs when probable and estimable, and updates personal injury, asbestos-related, and environmental liabilities based on actuarial analyses, while depreciation is determined using group methods and periodic studies that consider historical retirement patterns, technology, maintenance practices, and expected salvage to ensure asset lives and rates reflect current operating conditions. These initiatives demonstrate the organization’s ability to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions, adapt to internal and external variations, and maintain integrity, performance, and operational continuity despite pressures, constraints, and volatility in volumes, fuel prices, and market conditions.

In 2016, Merck continued to execute its innovation strategy and the company’s sustained investment in research yielded a number of recent approvals and regulatory milestones across various therapeutic areas, reflecting a strategic allocation of resources to support core and emerging assets and maintain performance amid competitive pressures and environmental turbulence. During the past year, the company focused on productivity improvements, reallocating resources across the portfolio to grow its strongest brands and support the most promising pipeline assets, with marketing and administrative expenses declining as part of this prioritization to highest-growth areas. Research and development expenses in 2016 reflect increased clinical development spending as the company continues to invest in the pipeline, while restructuring programs designed to streamline its cost structure resulted in the elimination of approximately 2,625 positions and the sale or closure of certain manufacturing facilities, thereby enhancing operational flexibility and optimizing the supply network in response to evolving market conditions. The termination of collaborations and joint ventures, including the cessation of the Europe vaccines joint venture with Sanofi and the resolution of the AstraZeneca LP partnership, as well as strategic acquisitions and alliances with Iomet, Afferent and Moderna to develop novel therapies, illustrate the company’s systemic perspective and adaptive strategies toward external pressures and innovation opportunities. Hedging programs to reduce the variability caused by foreign-exchange fluctuations, including revenue and balance-sheet risk management to preserve cash flows and revalue net monetary assets in hyperinflationary environments such as Venezuela, demonstrate risk-mitigation mechanisms to preserve system integrity. Capital expenditures focused on enhancing manufacturing and research capacities, together with use of debt and credit facilities to ensure general corporate liquidity, reflect resource generation and preparedness for sustaining continuity under varying economic and industry challenges. Lessons learned from the discontinuation of certain drug-development programs, such as odanacatib and surotomycin, informed reconfiguration of the research portfolio to concentrate on higher-value projects. Across all operations, the company has executed dynamic capabilities in reallocating financial and human capital, adapting its organizational structure, and deploying strategic initiatives to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, optimize firm performance, and emerge stronger from adverse events.

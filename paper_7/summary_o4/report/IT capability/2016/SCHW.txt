The company describes operational risk as arising from potentially inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or external events and maintains a comprehensive risk management program, including an enterprise risk management framework approved by the board of directors that incorporates risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting, and risk mitigation to manage operational, credit, market, liquidity and compliance risks. Senior management oversight is provided by a global risk committee and functional risk sub-committees that establish risk appetite, metrics, limits and tolerance levels, support recovery and contingency planning, and report regularly to the board’s risk committee. To preserve system integrity and maintain performance under stress, the firm maintains backup and recovery infrastructure with geographically dispersed facilities and workforce, routinely tests business continuity and disaster recovery plans, and requires Schwab Bank— which has until the end of 2017 to develop and prepare its recovery plan under OCC guidelines—to describe how it will restore itself to financial health and viability in response to a wide range of internal and external stress scenarios. Information-security risks are managed through a layered security program with advanced monitoring systems, employee training and access controls, while vendor, model and fiduciary risks are governed by dedicated policies, control self-assessments and internal audit reviews. The company conducts regular liquidity and capital stress testing, holds high-quality liquid assets equal to projected net cash outflows, establishes contingency funding scenarios and maintains credit facilities and a capital contingency plan for low-probability, high-impact events, all of which reinforce operational flexibility, resource availability and the maintenance of performance despite adversity.

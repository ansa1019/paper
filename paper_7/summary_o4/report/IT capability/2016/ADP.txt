In the face of ever-increasing regulatory complexity, foreign currency pressures and the challenges presented by ACA compliance, ADP has demonstrated its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning by investing in product innovation and service capabilities, upgrading clients from legacy platforms to modern cloud-based solutions and reconfiguring its platform through a multi-year service alignment initiative. Fiscal 2016 was another exciting and dynamic year that showcased our agility as we continued to adapt to the evolving needs of our clients and the changing regulatory environment within our HCM industry as evidenced by our ability to respond to the challenges presented by the ACA. The disposition of non-core assets such as the AMD business and a broad-based workforce optimization effort illustrate ADP’s strategic reallocation of resources to support recurring revenues and strong client retention. Its high-margin, recurring-revenue business model, low capital expenditure requirements and consistent cash generation, reinforced by a balanced capital structure—including $3.2 billion of cash and equivalents, a $9.25 billion committed credit facility and access to commercial paper and reverse repurchase agreements for client funds—have enabled operational continuity and risk mitigation. ADP’s laddered investment strategy for funds held for clients, together with established credit quality, maturity and exposure limits, further reduces volatility and supports performance maintenance under varying interest-rate and market conditions. The resulting resilience is evidenced by 7 percent revenue growth (8 percent on a constant-dollar basis) despite two percentage points of headwinds, a 60 basis point increase in adjusted EBIT margin to 19.5 percent, and continued ability to foresee, confront and benefit from disruptive change, thereby maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

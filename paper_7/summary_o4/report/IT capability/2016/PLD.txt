We believe the quality and scale of our global operating portfolio, combined with the expertise of our team and the strength of our balance sheet, provide unique competitive advantages and underpin our capacity for positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Our strategic plan to grow revenues, earnings, NOI, cash flows and funds from operations is supported by expectations for continued rent growth, value creation from development and economies of scale in assets under management, all of which contribute to organizational flexibility and resource optimization. We anticipate market rents to rise or, if flat, that our in-place leases—estimated to be more than ten percent below market rates—will translate into increased future earnings, NOI and cash flow upon renewal, reflecting our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning. A successful development and redevelopment program is predicated on maintaining control of well-positioned land, and our land bank, capable of supporting $8.4 billion of TEI logistics space, represents a reservoir of resources for future adaptation. Over the last several years, investments in technologies have yielded operational efficiencies, enabling expansion of real estate holdings with minimal increases in general and administrative expenses; we will continue to leverage these technologies and advanced data analysis to streamline operations, reduce costs and enhance decision making. Operating fundamentals in our markets have improved, positively affecting rental rates, occupancy and fueling development activity, while our business evaluation framework—based on NOI by segment, property-level metrics and same-store analyses conducted on an owned and managed basis—provides a systemic perspective to monitor core operations, allocate resources and guide strategic responses across both consolidated and unconsolidated ventures. We generated net proceeds of $3.0 billion from contributions and dispositions of real estate assets and amended our global senior credit facility to increase borrowing capacity to $3.0 billion, ensuring ready access to liquidity. We consider our ability to generate cash from operations, distributions from co-investment ventures, asset dispositions and available financing sources to be adequate to meet anticipated development, acquisition, operating, debt service, dividend and distribution requirements, with primary cash needs including completion and leasing of development projects, new developments, capital expenditures, debt repayment, further venture investments, acquisitions of operating properties and potential repurchase of debt or equity securities. To support these needs, we plan to utilize unrestricted cash balances, operating cash flows, management fees and promotes, venture distributions, proceeds from contributions and dispositions, credit facilities with $3.2 billion of borrowing capacity and potential debt or equity issuances. Our financial resilience is further reinforced by investment-grade credit ratings of A3 (Moody’s) and A- (S&P), ongoing compliance with debt covenants and prudent risk mitigation measures, including environmental reviews that have revealed no material liabilities and continuity planning for geopolitical events such as the U.K.’s referendum to leave the European Union, where we have not seen, nor do we anticipate, material operational or financial impact given our predominantly domestic customer base and long-dated lease maturities.

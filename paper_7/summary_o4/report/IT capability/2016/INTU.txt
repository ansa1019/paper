Throughout fiscal 2016, management emphasized organizational resilience by adapting to a dynamic and highly competitive software and services environment characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements.  To support operational flexibility and business continuity as the Company transitions to increasingly connected services, the sustained operation and availability of information technology and communication systems—both internal and of external service providers—has become increasingly important, and the Company continues investing significant management attention and resources in IT infrastructure as well as privacy and security capabilities, including additional security measures and collaboration with state and federal governments to mitigate fraud risk.  Liquidity and capital resources were managed to ensure the maintenance of sufficient cash, cash equivalents, and investments, the availability of a $1.5 billion credit facility (including a $500 million term loan and a $1 billion revolving facility) to meet seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, and other liquidity commitments for at least the next twelve months, and to provide strategic agility for potential acquisitions or partnerships.  In response to evolving market conditions and risk assessments, the Company completed certain acquisitions (e.g., the acquisition of Check Inc.) and strategic divestitures (e.g., the sales of Intuit Financial Services, Intuit Health, Demandforce, Quickbase, and Quicken), reclassifying and segregating net assets of discontinued operations and recognizing related gains or impairment charges, thereby reconfiguring its portfolio to preserve or improve functioning despite adversities.  Management continuously assesses goodwill and intangible assets for impairment—applying discounted cash flow and market approaches—and made adjustments as necessary to reflect changes in forecasted cash flows and market valuations, demonstrating the organization’s capacity to absorb strain and maintain integrity under internal and external disturbances.  The Company also allocates resources to product development, marketing, and sales efforts to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, enter new markets, and strengthen third-party relationships, thereby sustaining competitive advantage and positioning for growth under challenging conditions.

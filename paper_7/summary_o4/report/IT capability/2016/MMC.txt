The company’s MD&A describes a suite of risk management and financial strategies that support its ability to absorb strain and preserve performance under diverse pressures. Its Risk and Insurance Services segment delivers “risk management activities (risk advice, risk transfer and risk control and mitigation solutions)” alongside insurance and reinsurance broking, while its Consulting segment recently merged its Investment and Retirement businesses into a new Wealth business and rebranded Talent as Career, illustrating organizational reconfiguration and strategic adaptation. Revenue is analyzed net of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions and dispositions, evidencing responsiveness to environmental perturbations, and the company maintains liquidity through a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, commercial paper issuances, senior notes and diversified debt maturities, ensuring operational flexibility and resource deployment. Operating cash flows of $2.0 billion in 2016 and the regular repatriation of foreign earnings, segregated from fiduciary funds, demonstrate resource generation and business continuity planning. Retirement plans were closed to new accruals and replaced with defined contribution arrangements, accompanied by deficit recovery funding plans and periodic re-measurements of assets and liabilities, reflecting dynamic capabilities in reconstituting benefit trajectories under adverse conditions. The company also conducts quarterly case-level reviews and actuarial analyses to establish or adjust liabilities for legal loss contingencies and unrecognized tax positions, and performs annual qualitative goodwill impairment assessments, all of which constitute proactive risk assessment, recovery mechanisms and performance maintenance measures designed to preserve system integrity and adapt to both nominal and extraordinary disturbances.

Mastercard’s management monitors material litigation judgments and settlements separately from ongoing operations and evaluates ongoing performance without the impact of special items, thereby isolating one-time disruptions to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The company continues to monitor political and economic conditions around the world to identify opportunities for growth and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry, reflecting a systemic perspective and future orientation in response to external pressures. While the global nature of its business helps protect operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries, management recognizes the significant concentration of revenue generated in the United States and actively assesses the impact of adverse economic trends on our customers, merchants and cardholders to mitigate potential disruptions. Mastercard attempts to manage foreign currency balance-sheet remeasurement and cash-flow risk through its foreign exchange risk management activities, and it maintains substantial liquidity—comprising cash, cash equivalents, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, an unused revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program—to fund global operations, settlement guarantees and strategic initiatives. In November 2016 the company issued $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes for general corporate purposes, and in December 2016 its board approved a new $4 billion share repurchase program, demonstrating resource reconfiguration and adaptability in capital deployment. Subject to legally available funds, the board intends to continue paying quarterly dividends, with future declarations based on assessments of financial condition, operating results and cash needs, underscoring sustained performance maintenance and strategic agility. The company also guarantees the settlement of branded transactions between issuers and acquirers and accrues liabilities for probable litigation losses after regular review of legal and regulatory proceedings, affirming its commitment to preserving system integrity and organizational effectiveness under uncertainty.

During 2016, we continued to deploy and adapt our “un-carrier” strategy—with successive initiatives such as #GetThanked, T-Mobile One, and Un-carrier Next—to eliminate customer pain points, improve network quality and customer service, and deliver predictable pricing structures that have driven continued branded customer growth and reduced churn, demonstrating our ability to reconfigure resources and maintain performance under competitive and regulatory pressures.  We have invested heavily in the build-out of our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum and 4G LTE network, capitalizing interest and leveraging capital leases to enhance network capacity and operational flexibility, while simultaneously realizing significant synergies and cost savings from the decommissioning of the MetroPCS CDMA network.  In response to a handset OEM recall, we immediately impaired device inventory to net realizable value, recognized the impact in cost of equipment sales, and secured OEM reimbursement for direct and indirect costs, illustrating our risk-mitigation and recovery mechanisms.  Our frequent refinancing and incremental debt issuances— including public and affiliate-purchased senior notes, revolving credit facilities, and term loan commitments with Deutsche Telekom—have provided financial resources and liquidity to fund spectrum auctions, capital expenditures and working capital needs, underpinning our capacity to absorb financial strain and preserve liquidity.  We recorded gains on disposal of spectrum licenses and optimized working capital via increased lease revenues under our JUMP! on Demand program, equipment installment plan receivables sales and vendor financing arrangements, which, together with disciplined cost control across services, equipment sales and SG&A, have driven adjusted EBITDA growth of 41% and free cash flow growth of 108% in 2016.  We maintain a forecasting process to project financial and operating performance, assess risks and uncertainties, and ensure our capital allocation aligns with strategic objectives such as network resilience, business continuity and regulatory compliance, recognizing that our ability to foresee, confront and benefit from disruptive change is critical to sustaining performance, supporting customer needs, and emerging stronger from challenging conditions.

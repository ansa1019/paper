The Company’s management’s discussion and analysis discloses forward-looking statements concerning, among other matters, the sufficiency of cash and investments, cash flows from operations, and available financing to meet requirements for at least the next twelve months and continuous evaluation of alternatives for efficiently funding capital expenditures and ongoing operations to support business continuity. To develop new product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality under challenging conditions, we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities and equipment, and research and development, estimating net cash expenditures in 2017 of $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion, subject to market conditions. In response to adverse market pressures and the need to sharpen focus on key priorities, in the fourth quarter of 2016 we initiated a restructuring plan expected to save approximately $80 million per quarter in 2017 through a more focused set of projects and programs, permanent closure of open headcount requisitions, workforce reductions in certain areas, and other non-headcount related spending reductions. We revised the estimated useful lives of equipment in our DRAM wafer fabrication facilities from five to seven years in the fourth quarter of 2016 to reflect lengthening periods between technology-node transitions, increased reuse of equipment, and industry trends, which we expect will reduce depreciation costs by approximately $100 million per quarter in future periods. Our supply-chain resilience is supported by long-term agreements, including the January 1, 2016 DRAM pricing formula that equally shares margin with Inotera and a structured three-year wind-down period that phases our purchase of Inotera’s capacity. Liquidity strategies include a revolving credit facility providing up to $488 million of additional financing based on eligible receivables, a single-draw term loan facility of up to NT$80 billion collateralized by certain Inotera assets and guaranteed by Micron, optional issuance of common stock or convertible notes to Nanya, and capped-call transactions designed to mitigate dilution from our convertible notes. We also recognize constraints on cash and investments held by MMJ Group and IMFT due to legal and contractual restrictions, commitments of approximately $780 million for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment, and contractual obligations across notes payable, capital leases, operating leases, purchase obligations, and other long-term liabilities. Critical accounting estimates relating to business acquisitions, inventory net realizable value, goodwill impairment testing, deferred tax asset realizability, and property, plant and equipment impairments underscore our rigorous risk assessment and resource allocation processes. Collectively, these measures reflect our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite internal and external variations and disturbances, thereby maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

In 2016 our cash generated from operations continued to be a significant source of funds for investing in our growth, including acquisitions and strategic alliances, managing our contingencies and reducing our debt levels; we believe our investment grade credit profile reflects the size and diversity of our product portfolio, our strong cash flow, our solid financial fundamentals and our financial strategy; as part of our strategic imperatives to drive global expansion, we are seeking to grow net sales and market share by expanding our global presence, including in emerging markets, and we have increased our investment in infrastructure in these countries in order to maximize opportunities; we invest excess cash on hand in short-term financial instruments that earn market interest rates while mitigating principal risk through instrument and counterparty diversification, and we limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer; our 2016 restructuring plan is expected to result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $175 million to $225 million and reduce gross annual expenses by approximately $115 million to $150 million by the end of 2020 as program benefits are realized, with a substantial portion of the savings reinvested in strategic growth initiatives; we record provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory based upon our estimates of forecasted net sales and review these estimates regularly; in response to reports of device malfunction, we suspended our limited launch and initiated a voluntary removal of field inventory of the lotus valve systems and expect to bring the platform back to market in Europe and other regions in the fourth quarter of 2017; we are in the process of integrating acquired businesses and capabilities into our core organizations, including the Neovasc advanced biological tissue business, the interventional radiology business of Celonova, the EndoChoice portfolio and Cosman Medical, with the integrations expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2017 or 2018; we manage market risk from currency exchange rate changes at the corporate level and exclude the impact of these fluctuations when reviewing revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and comparison to past performance; and we believe that our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents, future cash generated from operations and access to capital markets and credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations, invest in our infrastructure, pay legal-related liabilities, fund possible mergers and acquisitions and service and repay our existing debt, although our liquidity plans remain subject to macroeconomic conditions, adverse litigation outcomes and other risks and uncertainties outside our control.

The company describes a suite of practices and processes designed to preserve functioning and performance under pressure, reflecting the maintenance of “positive adjustment under challenging conditions.” It closely monitors and adjusts wholesaler inventory levels—targeting approximately one month of supply—and establishes conservative accruals for product returns, rebates, and discounts based on historical return rates, anticipated patent expirations, recalls, and evolving competitive and regulatory environments, thereby sustaining business continuity. Research and development spending is managed portfolio-wide so that a delay or termination of any single project does not materially alter total R&D investment, demonstrating resource reconfiguration and operational flexibility. The integration of major acquisitions, such as Novartis Animal Health and Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica’s vaccine business, has required asset impairments, restructuring and severance charges, and closure of facilities, evidencing strategic change management and organizational adaptation. To mitigate external pressures—from the Venezuelan financial crisis and foreign currency fluctuations to healthcare pricing reforms and off-balance-sheet contingencies—the company employs hedging and risk-management programs, maintains committed credit facilities and commercial paper access, and forecasts cash needs to ensure adequate liquidity. Contingent milestone and royalty payments are only recognized when development successes justify expense, retaining the option to terminate underperforming collaborations. Defined-benefit pension and retiree health-benefit assumptions are reviewed annually to preserve system integrity, while tax positions and valuation allowances are evaluated to manage potential liabilities. Together, these measures support the firm’s ability to absorb strain, reconstitute trajectories in response to disruptive events, and deploy strategic resources to emerge stronger under nominal, extreme, or exceptional conditions.

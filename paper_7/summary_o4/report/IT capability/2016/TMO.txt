Throughout its management’s discussion and analysis, the company describes a deliberate strategy to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions and to expand product lines and services by developing and commercializing its own technologies, integrating Life Technologies, FEI, Affymetrix and other acquired businesses into its core segments to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite market pressures. The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, focused research projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience, while its references to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. Restructuring and other actions—such as severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities—are intended to streamline operations and realize annual cost savings of approximately $100 million, reflecting the company’s focus on reconfiguring resources to maintain resilience. The company manages liquidity and business continuity by maintaining $786 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016, undrawn revolving credit capacity of $2.5 billion, and the equivalent of outstanding commercial paper under its revolving credit facility in the event commercial paper markets become unavailable, and believes these resources together with anticipated cash flows will be sufficient to meet operating requirements for at least the next 24 months. Its critical accounting policies—for allowances for doubtful accounts, inventory writedowns, the annual and interim impairment testing of intangible assets and goodwill under varying projections of cash flows, revenue recognition based on relative selling prices and customer acceptance criteria, and accruals for contingencies and litigation—demonstrate systematic risk assessment and mitigation practices designed to sustain performance under internal and external variations. Tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries, including distributions that generate U.S. foreign tax credits, underscore adaptive resource deployment across jurisdictions without net tax cost, while the change to a full yield curve approach in estimating pension and retiree benefit costs illustrates enhanced precision in financial projections and liability management. Cumulatively, these strategic, operational and financial measures portray a multifaceted approach to organizational resilience—maintaining integrity and performance amid acquisitions, currency translation effects, restructuring actions, market volatility and evolving regulatory conditions.

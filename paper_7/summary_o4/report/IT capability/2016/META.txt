We note that our discussion of forward-looking statements, including plans, estimates, and beliefs regarding our financial condition and results of operations, reflects our need to anticipate and manage risks and uncertainties in order to maintain business continuity and performance under changing conditions; during 2016 we continued to invest in our core ecosystem—Facebook app and platform, video, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp—and in long-term technology initiatives such as virtual reality and artificial intelligence, and we intend to sustain and expand these investments by hiring top engineering talent, increasing research and development, content, sales and marketing efforts, and expanding data center capacity and office facilities to support rapid growth, absorb operational strain, and enhance adaptability; we recognize and provision for loss contingencies arising from litigation, claims, and investigations on a quarterly basis, adjusting our estimates based on negotiations, settlements, rulings, and legal advice to mitigate potential adverse impacts; to ensure sufficient liquidity and resource flexibility, we maintain $29.45 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, have a $2 billion revolving credit facility, and have authorized a $6 billion share repurchase program, while adopting a net share settlement approach for employee equity awards to manage cash outflows and share issuance; our expanded capital expenditures—projected at $7.0–$7.5 billion in 2017—are focused on data centers, servers, network infrastructure, and facilities to preserve system integrity and performance under higher user engagement and new product delivery; and we are actively evaluating and planning for the adoption of new accounting standards on revenue recognition, lease accounting, income tax, and restricted cash to maintain compliance and resilience in our reporting practices.

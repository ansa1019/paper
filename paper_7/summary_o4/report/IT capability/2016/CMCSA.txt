Comcast’s 2016 MD&A discloses a range of strategic investments and operational initiatives supporting organizational resilience by sustaining service continuity and performance under evolving conditions. The company underscores “investments to improve the customer experience, including by hiring additional personnel and developing and deploying various technology and software tools” together with “an increased investment in line extensions, primarily for the expansion of our business services; an increased investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity; the continued deployment of wireless gateways; and the continued deployment of our X1 platform and our cloud DVR technology,” to absorb strain and preserve functioning amid growth and technological shifts. Recognizing its operation in “intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments,” Comcast seeks to “mitigate increases in operating costs and expenses by growing revenue… and through cost management,” and anticipates continued increases in programming expenses due to contract renewals and multi-platform delivery, noting, “we believe that adding more content and delivering it on various platforms will help us to attract and retain video customers.” The expansion of its network of residential, outdoor and business Wi-Fi hotspots and the ongoing enhancement of technical and product support and customer service—“development, delivery and support of our enhanced devices and services” and “increased support for improving the customer experience”—further contribute to operational flexibility and adaptation to seasonal and cyclical variations. Comcast also emphasizes resilience in liquidity and capital resources, citing sustained cash flows from operations, “significant availability under our consolidated credit facilities, net of amounts outstanding” under commercial paper programs, and proactive share repurchase and dividend programs to maintain financial stability and support long-term objectives under variable market conditions.

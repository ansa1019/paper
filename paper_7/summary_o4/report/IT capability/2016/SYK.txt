Stryker’s annual report discloses a multifaceted approach to sustaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions through disciplined resource deployment, operational flexibility and strategic adaptation. The company’s capital allocation strategy prioritizes acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases, evidenced by $4,332 million invested in acquisitions such as Sage, Physio-Control and Synergetics in 2016 to strengthen its technological portfolio and competitive positioning. Research, development and engineering expenses represented 6.3 percent of net sales each year, reflecting continued investment in internal innovation and knowledge generation. Selling, general and administrative expense improvement initiatives, cost containment efforts and disciplined expense management drove leverage in operating expenses despite unfavorable mix and foreign currency impacts. Stryker supplements strong cash generation from operations with debt and commercial paper to maintain high-quality liquidity and support business continuity, increasing its main credit facility and commercial paper capacity by $250 million each in 2016, issuing $3,500 million of senior unsecured notes and repaying maturing obligations. Non-GAAP measures such as percentage organic sales growth and adjusted operating income are used for trend analysis, performance assessment and incentive compensation, enabling forward-looking decision making and risk mitigation. Geographic and segment diversification mitigates the impact of currency fluctuations, while reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, uncertain tax positions and product liability recalls demonstrate proactive contingency planning. Intangible assets and goodwill are recorded at fair value and tested annually for impairment using discounted cash flow models that incorporate forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, preserving system integrity. Finally, investments in a global ERP system and a dedicated additive manufacturing facility underscore Stryker’s commitment to operational continuity, adaptability and resilience engineering.

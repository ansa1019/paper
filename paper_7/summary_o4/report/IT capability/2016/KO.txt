In 2016, management introduced a formal water risk management program executed locally that assesses source availability, improves water use efficiency, enhances wastewater treatment, supports shared watershed protection, engages communities, and addresses agricultural supply-chain water management, in collaboration with suppliers, governments and nongovernmental organizations to replenish used water, apply water-related knowledge, and advocate policy reforms to safeguard a critical resource and sustain production under resource constraints. The company’s integrated quality management program applies rigorous product and ingredient safety and quality standards across more than 200 countries, driving continuous improvement, risk identification and mitigation through strong governance, regulatory compliance, standardized laboratory testing and due diligence to preserve product integrity under varying conditions. In addressing the complex public health challenge of obesity and evolving consumer preferences, the company allocates resources to product and package innovation—offering lower-calorie options, transparent nutritional labeling, responsible marketing and partnerships to reduce sugar and calories—reflecting agility in its brand portfolio and strategic response to external pressures. Its strategic priorities—accelerating a consumer-centric brand portfolio, driving revenue growth led by sparkling beverages, strengthening the Coca-Cola system, digitizing the enterprise and unlocking people’s potential—are delivered through core capabilities in consumer marketing, commercial and franchise leadership that embed Coca-Cola in customers’ businesses, foster inter-organizational collaboration, align incentives, share bottling best practices and reconfigure business models and territories to achieve scalability and efficiencies. Under its expanded productivity and reinvestment program, it pursues global supply-chain optimization, zero-based work methods, operating expense leverage, IT systems standardization and integration of bottling operations to generate productivity savings that are reinvested in consumer-facing initiatives, targeting $3.6 billion in annualized productivity by 2019 to support sustained net revenue growth and margin expansion. Financial resilience is reinforced by generating $8.8 billion of operating cash flow in 2016, maintaining diversified short- and long-term debt facilities, an extensive commercial-paper program and global liquidity of cash, short-term investments and marketable securities, while hedging currency and commodity exposures to mitigate performance variability under a stronger U.S. dollar and fluctuating input costs. The company continuously tests asset recoverability using discounted-cash–flow models, performs goodwill and intangible-asset impairment reviews and monitors variable-interest entities to ensure organizational health and resource deployment decisions preserve firm performance despite internal or external disturbances such as currency devaluations, hyperinflationary environments and the refranchising of bottling operations. This multifaceted approach to risk assessment, crisis management, resource allocation and strategic adaptation exemplifies the preservation of operational continuity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

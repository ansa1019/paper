Throughout fiscal 2016, Lowe’s sustained its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under challenging conditions by leveraging its larger store formats and expertise in customer experience design to inspire and differentiate its offerings for both DIY and professional customers while driving convenience, inspiration, expertise, and efficiency across the customer project journey through enhanced omni-channel capabilities. The national rollout of interior and exterior project specialist programs provided a differentiated capability in capturing and serving home improvement demand, and the acquisition and integration of Rona accelerated the company’s growth strategy in the Canadian market by enhancing customer relevance, expanding customer reach, driving increased profitability through shared supplier relationships, scale and private-label brand capabilities, and eliminating redundant public company costs. Lowe’s demonstrated operational flexibility and resource reconfiguration through targeted promotional activity, value improvement efforts, optimized store payroll hours against customer traffic, and more efficient advertising, which collectively reduced costs, supported improved gross margin and SG&A leverage, and enhanced working capital management. To ensure business continuity and mitigate liquidity risks under internal and external variations, the company amended its credit facility to extend maturity to November 2021, maintained access to a $1.75 billion commercial paper-backed borrowing capacity, preserved favorable senior debt ratings, and affirmed continued access to capital markets. A fiscal 2017 capital forecast of approximately $1.4 billion was allocated across existing store investments and re-merchandising, new store expansion, corporate infrastructure enhancements to advance customer experience, and distribution network upgrades, preserving and improving performance amid a favorable macroeconomic backdrop. The company also returned excess cash to shareholders through $3.5 billion in share repurchases and $1.1 billion in dividends, while its self-insurance programs and conservative contractual obligations spanning debt, leases and purchase commitments reflected a systemic perspective on risk assessment, resource allocation and crisis preparedness. Looking forward, Lowe’s three strategic objectives—to expand reach and profitable share gains, to adapt to evolving customer needs by developing capabilities to anticipate and support their project journeys via omni-channel assets, and to enhance operating discipline and productivity as core strengths—underscore its dynamic capabilities, resilience strategies and commitment to maintaining performance and emerging stronger under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

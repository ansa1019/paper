We have continued to reinvest in our business by adding new stores and remodeling existing ones, while strengthening our infrastructure in support of our continuing growth, and maintained strong cash flows that allow us to return value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, reinforcing our financial flexibility.  We routinely enter into inventory‐related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases, and we leverage buying and occupancy costs as a result of same store sales growth to improve our profit margin on merchandise sold despite transactional foreign exchange pressures.  We have deployed strategic resource allocation through investments to support growth—including wage increases, supply chain enhancements and the opening of new distribution centers—and have refinanced higher‐cost debt by issuing $1.0 billion of ten-year notes to redeem 6.95% notes, recording a pre‐tax loss on early extinguishment, and offered lump‐sum pension settlements to former plan participants to manage our obligations.  Our operating cash flows, driven by net income adjusted for non‐cash items, have been supplemented by effective inventory and accounts payable management and increases in accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, gift cards, sales and income taxes payable.  We fund capital expenditures—approximately $1.2 billion in fiscal 2018 plans for offices, distribution centers, store renovations and new stores—through internally generated funds and maintain liquidity via cash and cash equivalents, revolving credit facilities and commercial paper issuance.  We carry non‐cancelable lease and purchase obligations, evaluate recoverability of long‐lived assets, goodwill and tradenames under varying assumptions of weighted average cost of capital and growth, and maintain reserves for casualty insurance and uncertain tax positions, altogether enabling the preservation and partial improvement of our integrity and performance under internal and external variations and disturbances.

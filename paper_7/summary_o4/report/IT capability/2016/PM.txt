In management’s discussion and analysis, the company describes the organization and resource allocation across four geographic segments—European Union; Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa; Asia; and Latin America & Canada—and a diversified portfolio of premium, mid-price and low-price international and local brands in over 180 markets, supporting operational flexibility and competitive positioning. The ongoing development and commercialization of reduced-risk products, which produce far lower quantities of harmful compounds than cigarette smoke, exemplifies a strategic innovation and risk mitigation initiative aligned with evolving customer needs. The company notes that net revenues and operating income are affected by volume, pricing, currency exchange rates and product mix, and it commits marketing, administration and research resources to new product development. As a holding company, it relies on dividends and debt repayments from subsidiaries, which are not constrained by long-term debt agreements, to maintain financial resources. During 2015, the company recorded pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs of $68 million related to severance costs for organizational restructuring in the European Union segment, reflecting reconfiguration of operations to achieve strategic objectives. It identifies unfavorable currency movements, notably a stronger U.S. dollar against several local currencies, as impacting profitability across primary markets, and recognizes the favorable impact on interest from lower effective debt rates and higher interest income. Improvements in 2016 operations—primarily higher pricing and lower marketing, administration and research costs, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix—demonstrate maintenance of performance under varying conditions. The 2017 forecast projects diluted EPS of $4.70 to $4.85, excluding currency effects and share repurchases, which represents a 9-12% increase over 2016 adjusted EPS, reflecting proactive planning, risk assessment and strategic foresight, while acknowledging continuing risks described in Item 1A.

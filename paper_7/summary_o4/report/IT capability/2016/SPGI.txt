S&P Global has proactively realigned its business portfolio, exiting non-core assets and executing divestitures while acquiring targeted businesses such as SNL, Pira and RigData to focus resources on scalable, interrelated industry-leading segments in the capital and commodity markets. Through segment realignment initiatives and ongoing restructuring actions, the company has enhanced operational flexibility and reduced costs in legacy operations, with resource allocation guided by segment operating profit metrics. S&P Global maintains strong liquidity and financial capacity—leveraging cash on hand, robust cash flows from operations and a committed $1.2 billion revolving credit facility subject to a conservative debt-to-cash-flow covenant—to ensure business continuity and support strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividend payments. The company’s strategic priorities of growth, operational excellence, digital transformation and innovation, as well as leadership and accountability, reflect a future-oriented framework for stimulating service innovation, expanding in high-growth international markets and strengthening competitive advantage. Proactive risk mitigation measures include comprehensive legal and regulatory compliance programs, professional fee and legal expense management following significant settlements, and adaptation to evolving credit rating and benchmark regulations globally. S&P Global continuously monitors market issuance volumes as operational indicators, employs rigorous forecasting and critical accounting estimates, and evaluates performance through free cash flow analysis to sustain financial resilience. While acknowledging potential adverse impacts from global credit market conditions, regulatory changes and foreign exchange variability, the company’s robust balance sheet, disciplined capital resources management and ongoing investments in its core businesses support its ability to absorb strain, preserve and improve functioning under challenging conditions.

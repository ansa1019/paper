Blackstone’s 2016 MD&A describes a systematic approach to maintaining continuity and performance under volatile and disruptive conditions—what organizational resilience scholars term “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions”—by structuring its operations into four core business segments (private equity, real estate, hedge fund solutions and credit) and by deploying resources dynamically to absorb strain and reconfigure trajectories toward future growth. Its private equity segment employs buy-and-build platforms and a tactical opportunities business that “seeks to capitalize on complex and dislocated market situations across asset classes, industries and geographies,” while its real estate group acquires high-quality, under-managed assets at an attractive basis, addresses property and business issues through active asset management and sells assets once its business plans are accomplished, reflecting continuous risk assessment and operational flexibility. The amendment and restatement of its $1.5 billion revolving credit facility—increasing capacity and extending maturity—underscores its emphasis on business continuity and resource allocation in periods of uncertainty. Blackstone monitors economic income, fee-related earnings and distributable earnings as key performance indicators to ensure that recurring revenues cover operating expenses, support strategic initiatives and strengthen organizational health, and it measures inflows, outflows, market appreciation and realizations across its fee-earning assets under management to assess performance under pressure, guide resource deployment and sustain resilience in a VUCA environment.

In the face of mixed U.S. economic conditions, uneven global growth, shifting trade patterns and fuel-price volatility, management continued to adjust air capacity and cost structure to better match prevailing volume levels, mobilized resources through activity-based costing and targeted expense allocations, and relied on the flexibilities inherent in its broad transportation network and product portfolio to adapt to changing trends. Strategic initiatives to enhance network resilience included improving transportation-network flexibility and capacity, strengthening yield management, boosting operational efficiency and containing costs across all segments—most notably through deployment of facility automation projects and accelerated rollout of the on-road integrated optimization and navigation system (“ORION”)—and by utilizing newly expanded operating facilities to improve regional time-in-transit. Productivity improvements were realized by realigning air and ground networks to volume shifts, leveraging ORION to contain average daily vehicle miles driven, optimizing delivery density via redirected SurePost volume and selectively managing customer and product mix. In supply chain & freight operations, UPS expanded capabilities through targeted acquisitions, managed fluctuating tonnage and customer mix with purchased transportation and disciplined revenue-management measures, and reconfigured service offerings to meet evolving demand. These operational responses, supported by robust liquidity and risk-mitigation measures—including cash and marketable-security holdings, self-insurance reserves, credit facilities, commercial-paper and debt-management programs, disciplined pension contributions and share-repurchase activities—demonstrate the company’s ability to absorb economic and operational variability, preserve system integrity and maintain or improve performance under challenging conditions.

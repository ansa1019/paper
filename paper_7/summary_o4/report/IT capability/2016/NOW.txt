Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, and investors should carefully consider the “Risk Factors” section for important factors that could cause actual results and the timing of certain events to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by these statements. We continue to invest in the development of our services, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth, offering subscription services with annual fees that include hosting, support, data backup and disaster recovery services, as well as future upgrades, thereby enhancing business continuity and system resilience. Facility costs and interconnectivity between data centers, depreciation of our cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment, and personnel costs directly associated with our infrastructure and customer support collectively underpin our operational continuity and scalability. We generate revenues through our direct sales force, channel partners and professional services—including implementation, configuration and training of customer and partner personnel—supporting adaptation and continuity in customer environments and ensuring knowledge absorption across our ecosystem. We generally bill customers annually in advance for subscriptions and monthly in arrears for professional services, which together with our global revenue base—32% of revenues from outside North America in 2016—provide cash flow predictability and geographic diversification to mitigate regional disruptions. As of December 31, 2016, we had $899.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, $262.7 million in long-term investments, and increased our overall headcount to 4,801, and we anticipate these resources, supplemented by net cash provided by operating activities—comprising net loss adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and changes in operating assets and liabilities—will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs (including data center expansion, lease obligations, workforce growth and acquisition of fixed assets, intangibles and office investments) for at least the next 12 months; if additional capital resources are required, we may fund our operations from existing balances or seek additional equity or debt financing. We consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States and have no off-balance sheet arrangements that expose us to unmanaged financing, liquidity, market or credit risk.

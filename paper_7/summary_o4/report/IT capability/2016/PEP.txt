PepsiCo’s 2016 Form 10-K describes numerous policies and practices reflecting an ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including the systematic monitoring of indicators such as safety, innovation, product and service quality, organizational health, employee diversity and productivity savings to sustain performance under pressure. Management’s “performance with purpose” strategy embeds sustainability into every aspect of the business, combining prudent capital allocation, lean cost structures, local sourcing, agricultural technology development, automation and skills upgrading to navigate geopolitical uncertainty, regulatory shifts, macroeconomic volatility, currency fluctuations, climate change and water scarcity. The company has set ten-year goals emphasizing healthier products, retail and foodservice growth, environmental stewardship, workplace culture and community support as means to strengthen long-term viability. To address external pressures and capitalize on arising opportunities, PepsiCo has deployed an integrated risk management framework—comprising board oversight, a corporate risk committee, division and country risk teams, a risk management office, internal audit and compliance and ethics functions—to identify, assess, prioritize, mitigate and communicate risks related to political and social instability, supply-chain disruptions, taxation changes and market fluctuations. Market-risk management relies on productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs, fixed-price contracts and the use of commodity, foreign-exchange and interest-rate derivatives to absorb cost inflation and safeguard margins, while multiyear productivity and restructuring plans, facility reorganizations, selective refranchising and the deconsolidation of Venezuelan operations demonstrate the company’s capacity to reconfigure resources, maintain continuity and emerge stronger from disruptive events. This combination of proactive measures, dynamic capabilities, resource reconfiguration and ongoing adaptation underscores PepsiCo’s commitment to system resilience, preserving integrity and performance in both nominal and extreme conditions.

In designing our products, we focus on making our technology easy and safe to use, and we have developed training technologies—including a skills simulator, remote case observation and mentoring tools, and a dual console for collaborative surgery—to build internal knowledge, capability, and operational flexibility. Procedure adoption is driven market by market by relative patient value and total treatment costs, reflecting our strategic adaptation to external pressures and support of business continuity through resource allocation in marketing, development, and training. Recurring revenue, which grew faster than system revenue and now represents over 70% of total revenue, underscores our ability to absorb strain and preserve performance on a growing installed base of systems. Our leasing program, offering flexible acquisition terms, expands surgery availability while leveraging our balance sheet, and we stand ready to extend it based on customer demand. We maintain rigorous risk mitigation and crisis management processes by notifying customers, providing documentation, and arranging product returns, replacements, or service visits in connection with field actions or recalls, and we acknowledge that such actions can affect reputation, purchase timing, system usage, and revenue. System demand and procedure growth are influenced by evolving healthcare policies, market dynamics, consolidation trends, reimbursement changes, and competitive entries, demonstrating our strategic agility under environmental turbulence. We plan substantial investments—up to $80 million more in 2017—in key product development and clinical initiatives, illustrating future orientation and resourcefulness. Liquidity is generated primarily by operations and employee equity exercises, providing substantial financial flexibility; we intend to reinvest foreign earnings indefinitely to support global operations. We manage inventory at the lower of cost or market with provisions for obsolescence, apply estimated selling prices under internal controls for revenue allocation, and conduct ongoing assessments of tax, legal, and regulatory contingencies, reflecting organizational intelligence and governance. Growth in instrument, accessory, and service revenue is driven by procedure volume increases, innovation in advanced instruments, and adaptive use of refurbished endoscopes, although expanding xi installations will necessitate greater service resources and higher replacement costs. We have secured necessary clearances and continue to manage variable regulatory statuses and reimbursement uncertainties, exemplifying regulatory risk management and strategic planning. A joint venture targeting robotic-assisted catheter-based medical devices for lung cancer diagnosis and treatment underscores our inter-organizational collaboration, strategic initiative, and willingness to accept pre-commercial losses in pursuit of long-term resilience.

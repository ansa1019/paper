Berkshire Hathaway reports that through its subsidiaries it “engage[s] in a number of diverse business activities” managed “on an unusually decentralized basis,” with minimal day-to-day headquarters involvement, enabling operational flexibility and localized decision-making; senior corporate management retains responsibility for “significant capital allocation decisions,” “investment activities” and monitoring corporate governance—communicating the appropriate “tone at the top” and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues—thereby preserving organizational health and coherence under external pressures. Its insurance operations “assume defined portions of the risks of loss” in primary insurance and reinsurance activities and “strive to generate underwriting profits in essentially all of our product lines,” while recognizing that “the timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility” and that “actual claim settlements and revised loss estimates will develop over time,” prompting regular updates of loss estimates and embodying adaptive risk mitigation processes. The firm maintains “ample liquidity” with cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury bills of $70.9 billion at December 31 2016, “insisting on safety over yield” as paramount for business continuity and resilience to internal or external variations; it funds substantial capital expenditures with “cash flows from operations and new debt issuances,” deploying resources to sustain functioning in adverse conditions. Burlington Northern Santa Fe (“BNSF”) adjusts employment levels, fuel usage and operating expenses in response to fluctuating volumes and shifts in the competitive landscape, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) employs derivative instruments—“forwards, futures, options, swaps and other agreements”—to “effectively secure future supply or sell future production generally at fixed prices,” recovering settled costs through regulated rates, both illustrative of strategic adaptation to environmental disruptions. In addition, Berkshire’s finance and financial products businesses manage exposures by writing derivative contracts, updating fair values under Black-Scholes models, and maintaining high credit ratings to preserve access to capital; the Company also cautions that its forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, reflecting its continual process of risk assessment and organizational learning to preserve positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

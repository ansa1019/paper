During 2016, our production capability continued to scale and gain operational efficiencies as production volume increased by 64% year-over-year and we greatly ramped model X deliveries, supported by enhanced vehicle offerings such as all-wheel-drive capability, Autopilot options and free over-the-air software updates. In early 2017, we completed the acquisition of Grohmann Engineering GmbH and began installing Model 3 manufacturing equipment at our Fremont facility and Gigafactory 1, positioning us to support volume production and deliveries in the second half of 2017 and meet our target to build 500,000 vehicles in 2018. In order to accommodate a much larger fleet and provide timely customer service, we are expanding our sales, service and charging infrastructure worldwide, opening new Tesla retail and service locations and investing in new supercharger sites across North America, Europe and Asia. In addition to expanding production and service activities, we expect to continue lowering manufacturing costs through economies of scale, material cost reductions from engineering and commercial actions, increased manufacturing efficiencies, better inventory control and minimization of scrap, which has already resulted in reduced warranty expense. We continue to invest heavily in capital expenditures for tooling, production equipment, construction of Gigafactory 1 and development of Gigafactory 2, and believe that our current sources of liquidity—including cash, cash equivalents, asset-based financing, warehouse facilities and potential equity or debt offerings—together with projected operating cash flows and working capital management, will provide adequate funding over at least the next 12 months to support ongoing operations, research and development, capital projects and global expansion, although additional funds may not be available on favorable terms or at all. We continually evaluate our capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations with suppliers to secure raw materials and manufacturing capacity, operating lease commitments and long-term debt financing, recognizing that future events could cause costs to exceed expectations or timelines to extend, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain performance and positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

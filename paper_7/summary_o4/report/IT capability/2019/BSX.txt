Management’s discussion and analysis describes the integration of acquired businesses and the reconfiguration of operations—“following the closing of the acquisition, the interventional medicine business was integrated into our peripheral interventions division”—as well as the execution of global restructuring initiatives, including the “movement of business activities; the elimination or combination of redundant roles and business processes; the consolidation or closure of facilities and legal entities; and the transfer of product lines between manufacturing facilities” and the implementation of end-to-end business process streamlining and automation, which collectively support operational flexibility, resource reallocation and performance preservation under external pressures. The adoption of the EU MDR regulatory framework is characterized as a “significant change to a regulatory framework,” with incremental compliance costs tracked separately from core operating measures to ensure business continuity and strategic foresight. The company’s use of non-GAAP financial measures—operational net sales (excluding foreign currency fluctuations) and adjusted net income (excluding acquisition/divestiture-related net charges, restructuring charges, litigation-related net charges, EU MDR implementation charges and discrete tax items)—provides management with “information management believes to be relevant to understanding the financial condition and results of operations,” enabling continued positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Liquidity and capital resource strategies, which include cash and equivalents, access to credit facilities, commercial paper and diversified short-term investments, demonstrate risk mitigation and resilience in funding operations and strategic initiatives even amid market volatility and currency swings. Ongoing assessment and remeasurement of contingent consideration liabilities, litigation reserves and tax settlements further reflect dynamic risk management and adaptation to adverse legal and economic developments. Finally, established internal control and cybersecurity escalation processes are maintained to preserve system integrity, ensure reliable financial reporting and support timely crisis response, all of which contribute to the company’s ability to absorb strain and maintain performance in the face of adversity.

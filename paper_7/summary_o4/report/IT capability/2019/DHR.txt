Danaher’s MD&A emphasizes its geographic and industry diversity, noting that “the range of its products, software and services help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results,” and describes management’s ongoing monitoring of competitors and customers worldwide to gauge relative performance and future outlook under external pressures. The company identifies that its “long-term growth and profitability will depend in particular on its ability to expand its business in high-growth geographies and high-growth market segments, identify, consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions, develop innovative and differentiated new products and services with higher gross profit margins, expand and improve the effectiveness of the company's sales force, continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality, and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated global environment,” reflecting strategic adaptation and resource deployment to maintain performance. To address rapid technological change, Danaher is “making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources… in order to be responsive to the company's customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the company's operations,” demonstrating capability to absorb strain and preserve functioning. In response to geopolitical uncertainty, the company “continues to monitor the status of Brexit and plan for potential impacts,” and “to mitigate the potential impact of Brexit on the import of goods to the UK, the company has increased its level of inventory within the UK,” illustrating risk assessment, business continuity planning and resource reconfiguration. Liquidity management is addressed through diverse financing sources—including commercial paper, credit facilities and debt and equity issuances—and a shelf registration statement intended “for general corporate purposes, including without limitation repayment or refinancing of debt or other corporate obligations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends and/or working capital,” underscoring preparedness to meet cash requirements under varying conditions. The company’s use of a non-GAAP core sales growth measure “provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in Danaher’s business and facilitating comparisons of Danaher’s revenue performance with its performance in prior and future periods and to Danaher’s peers” and is used internally “to measure the company's operating and financial performance and as one of the performance measures in the company's executive short-term cash incentive program.” Danaher also outlines productivity improvement initiatives, cost savings, and reinvestment in sales, service and marketing growth initiatives, while excluding currency translation and acquisition impacts from core sales “because the nature, size, timing and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from period-to-period and between the company and its peers and can… obscure underlying business trends,” reflecting an effort to maintain system integrity and clarity of performance metrics. Risk management approaches include diversification of credit risk, use of derivatives to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate exposure, and maintenance of liquidity via highly liquid investments and unused credit facility capacity. Capital allocation priorities cover operating, investing and financing activities, including “support [for] working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments, pay interest and service debt, pay taxes and any related interest or penalties, fund its restructuring activities and pension plans as required, pay dividends to shareholders, repurchase shares of the company's common stock and support other business needs,” which together demonstrate a systematic approach to ensuring operational flexibility, organizational health and business continuity—key facets of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

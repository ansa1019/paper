During the year, we continued to allocate and reconfigure resources across our operations to preserve and enhance performance amid evolving pressures, including investing $15.65 billion in data center capacity, network infrastructure, office facilities and expanded headcount to support user growth, engagement and the delivery of new products and services, as well as anticipating capital expenditures of $17 billion to $19 billion in 2020 to maintain operational continuity.  We apply complex measurement and estimation models—translating revenue on a constant currency basis, calibrating active user metrics with machine learning–based attribution techniques subject to error margins, and regularly evaluating critical accounting policies such as income taxes, loss contingencies, and goodwill and intangible asset recoverability—to absorb variability in foreign exchange rates, seasonal ad spending cycles, legal and regulatory developments (including a $5.0 billion FTC settlement accrual), and uncertain tax positions.  We recognize revenue and costs under uncertain conditions by estimating deferred tax assets and liabilities, assessing valuation allowances based on historical and forward‐looking evidence, and reviewing long‐lived assets for impairment when events suggest that carrying amounts may not be recoverable.  Liquidity management and risk mitigation measures include maintaining $54.86 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an undrawn $2 billion revolving credit facility, a flexible share repurchase program, and contractual commitments for network and data center operations to ensure the firm’s ability to foresee, confront and adapt to external disturbances, preserve system integrity and performance under pressure, and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

In fiscal 2019, Starbucks initiated continued streamlining efforts to accelerate growth in high-returning businesses, converted select market operations to fully licensed models, realigned its operating segment reporting structure by combining the China/Asia Pacific and EMEA segments into a single International segment, and reclassified company-owned store occupancy costs from cost of sales to store operating expenses—revising prior-period financial information for consistency without impacting consolidated net revenues, total operating expenses, operating income, or EPS. The licensing of its CPG and foodservice businesses to Nestlé under the global coffee alliance and the associated lapping of prior-year effects demonstrates a reconfiguration of resources to preserve margin and strengthen future flexibility. Starbucks actively manages cash and investments—including a diversified portfolio of readily marketable government and corporate debt securities—both to internally fund operations, capital expenditures (approximately $1.8 billion forecast for fiscal 2020), debt service, and shareholder distributions, and to maintain business continuity under a $2 billion five-year revolving credit facility, a $1 billion 364-day facility, and a $3 billion commercial paper program, all subject to covenant compliance. Through successive long-term note issuances across three- to thirty-year maturities and the use of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, the company preserves financial resilience against interest-rate variability. Commodity-price and foreign-exchange risks are mitigated via embedded contract pricing features and derivatives governed by market-risk policies and counterparty limits—generally not exceeding three-year maturities—while equity price exposures tied to the management deferred compensation plan are monitored for limited impact. Regular reviews of indefinite reinvestment assertions for unremitted foreign earnings, coupled with adjustments for tax-law changes such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, reflect adaptive tax planning. These strategic initiatives, resource reallocations, risk-mitigation mechanisms and organizational changes collectively support the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions and enable Starbucks to preserve or improve functioning despite internal or external disturbances.

Management’s strategy includes integrated activities intended to maintain and strengthen our competitive position in the industry. In 2019, we advanced our innovative pipeline, launched branded biosimilar programs, built our global geographic reach and expanded our next-generation manufacturing capabilities, while returning capital to shareholders and delivering strong financial results despite competition from biosimilars and generics. During the year, we continued to advance our pipeline, including AMG 510, launched Evenity® in the United States and Japan and secured marketing authorization in Europe, expanded our biosimilar program with the launches of Kanjinti™ and Mvasi™ in the United States and the approval of AVSOLA™ for all approved indications of the reference product, and made a regulatory submission for ABP 798. We have also continued to invest in external opportunities to augment our internal programs and products, completing our acquisition of worldwide rights to Otezla®, strengthening our international footprint through a strategic collaboration with BeiGene to expand our oncology presence in China, and expanding our human genetics capabilities by entering into a collaboration with a regional healthcare system and joining a consortium to perform whole genome sequencing of approximately 500,000 participants; our human genetics capabilities allow us to identify new development targets in our chosen areas of therapeutic focus. Our long-term success depends, to a great extent, on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. We devote considerable resources to research and development activities, while addressing increasing regulatory scrutiny, rising healthcare costs and economic pressures that pose challenges to our business. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income, and our liquidity framework—including a commercial paper program, a $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement and access to domestic and foreign debt and equity markets—enables us to fund our working-capital needs, capital expenditures, dividends, stock repurchases, debt maturities and strategic transactions while remaining in compliance with covenants and preserving operational continuity under challenging conditions.

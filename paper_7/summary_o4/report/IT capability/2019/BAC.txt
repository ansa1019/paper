Our enterprise‐wide risk framework, overseen by the board, integrates defined roles and accountabilities across the first line (businesses), second line (independent risk management) and third line (corporate audit) to enable the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, preserve organizational integrity and sustain performance through internal and external variations and disturbances.  We conduct periodic stress testing, scenario analysis and an internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) to project the impacts of baseline and adverse economic and market scenarios on our balance sheet, earnings and capital, and we maintain total loss‐absorbing capacity, regulatory capital buffers and diversified funding sources—including stable deposits, high‐quality liquid assets, secured and unsecured debt—to ensure operational flexibility and business continuity under unexpected situations or extreme conditions.  Contingency planning and a financial recovery plan establish monitoring, escalation and strategic de‐risking actions such as asset or business sales, capital issuance or portfolio reconfiguration to mitigate liquidity stress, while structured intercompany arrangements and global liquidity sources support a single‐point‐of‐entry resolution strategy, enabling rapid resource reallocation and continuity of critical functions.  Credit risk is managed through statistical models, internal risk ratings, concentration limits, lending standards, credit protection, loan modification programs and collection strategies to absorb strain, mitigate losses and adapt to borrower stress, and trading and banking‐book interest rate and foreign exchange mismatches are hedged with derivatives and combined hedge portfolios to stabilize net interest income and protect against yield‐curve shifts.  Our operational resilience is reinforced by comprehensive compliance and operational risk management programs, information security controls, governance committees, independent testing and regular back‐testing of market‐risk measures, all of which contribute to our capacity to foresee, confront and recover from disruptions, reconstitute trajectories in immediate response to events, and strategically reconfigure toward the future.

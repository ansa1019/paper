In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to quarantines, facility closures and travel and logistics restrictions that have disrupted our supply chain, supplier and vendor operations and created uncertainty in customer demand, we have reduced store operating hours, expanded our paid time off policy for associates, shifted certain store support operations to remote or virtual environments, implemented foot-traffic management measures and, in jurisdictions where required, ceased or delayed commencement of non-life-sustaining services, while actively monitoring the situation and retaining the flexibility to take additional actions as appropriate to protect the interests of our associates, customers, suppliers, vendors and shareholders. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows of $13.7 billion, commercial paper programs backed by credit facilities and access to long-term debt capital markets should be sufficient to fund our operating requirements, capital expenditures (projected at approximately $2.8 billion for fiscal 2020), dividend payments and debt obligations through the next several fiscal years, and we may adjust our capital investment plans or obtain alternative financing sources as necessary given ongoing uncertainty. In March 2020, we expanded our commercial paper capacity from $3.0 billion to $6.0 billion, entered into an additional 364-day $3.5 billion credit facility, and suspended share repurchases to preserve financial flexibility. Our disciplined management of working capital, non-GAAP measures such as ROIC to assess capital deployment effectiveness, rigorous evaluation of long-lived assets for impairment at the individual store level, self-insurance programs for general liability, workersâ€™ compensation, employee medical and automobile claims, and structured vendor allowance and inventory valuation processes under the retail inventory method collectively enable us to absorb strain, maintain system integrity and preserve or improve our functioning under both nominal and challenging conditions.

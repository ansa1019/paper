The Company reports that it relies on an extensive network of non-U.S. partners, key suppliers and subcontractors and continually monitors the global trade environment for changes in tariffs, trade agreements, sanctions and other geopolitical developments that may impact the Company, noting that exogenous developments such as fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics and increased environmental regulations render the industry vulnerable to disruptions. In response to the March 2019 FAA grounding of the 737 MAX, Boeing reduced and temporarily suspended production, concluded that suspension and gradual resumption at low rates would generate abnormal production costs to be expensed as incurred rather than inventoried, recorded a $6.1 billion charge for estimated customer concessions and established a $7.4 billion liability for future considerations, and continues to monitor supplier readiness and negotiate with customers while focusing on safely returning the 737 MAX to service, improving its products and services and implementing cost-reduction measures to protect its competitive position. Liquidity and capital‐resource strategies include a $12 billion delayed‐draw term loan facility, substantial unused revolving‐credit capacity, a commercial paper program and reliance on term‐debt markets to satisfy funding requirements, with the expectation that these sources will support short- and long-term commitments and provide financial flexibility for strategic opportunities. The Company’s risk-management and forecasting processes for long-term contracts and commercial‐airplane programs involve quarterly estimation and reassessment of total sales, costs and profit—recognizing cumulative catch-up adjustments and reach‐forward loss provisions—and it subjects goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets to impairment tests based on discounted cash flows. Pension and postretirement benefit obligations are measured annually using assumptions for discount rates and expected returns that the Company acknowledges can materially affect expense, projected benefit obligations and shareholders’ equity.

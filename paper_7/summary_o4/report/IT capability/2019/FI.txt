Management frequently reviews its portfolio to ensure the appropriate set of businesses to execute its strategy, acquiring businesses to meet compelling strategic needs such as new products, services or technology and divesting those misaligned with market, product or financial objectives, with segment realignment and First Data integration plans expected to be finalized in the first quarter of 2020. Primary liquidity needs—to fund operating expenses, service indebtedness and capital expenditures—are met through operating cash flow, $893 million of cash and cash equivalents, $3.3 billion available under the revolving credit facility and additional bridge and term loan facilities subject to leverage and interest coverage covenants, thereby preserving business continuity under nominal and extreme external pressures. In response to evolving industry trends including digital payments expansion and regulatory and cybersecurity complexities, the company emphasizes scalable recurring revenue solutions, outsourced infrastructure services and economies of scale to enhance operational effectiveness, compliance and competitive advantage. The acquisition of First Data expanded the portfolio of services, reconfigured resources to repay $16.4 billion of First Data debt via a combination of cash, senior notes and term loans, and prompted $56 million in restructuring charges to reduce vendor spend and eliminate duplicate costs, with further efficiency initiatives under evaluation to sustain system integrity and performance. Scalable revenue growth in recurring revenue businesses improved operating leverage by approximately 50 basis points in payments and 60 basis points in account processing in 2019, partially offset by a $48 million non-cash impairment on an international core processing platform and $633 million of acquired intangible asset amortization. Strategic initiatives—including active portfolio management, disciplined capital allocation, client-focused incremental investments and innovation—are designed to enhance adaptability, risk mitigation and resource reconfiguration, with ongoing judgments in fair value determinations, contract modifications, hedge accounting and capital structure management to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions and long-term organizational resilience.

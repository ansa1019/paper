Qualcomm’s 2019 Management’s Discussion and Analysis reflects multiple resilience strategies, such as its “cost plan designed to align our cost structure to our long-term margin targets,” under which “we initiated a series of targeted actions across our businesses with the objective to reduce annual costs by $1 billion,” actions that yielded $213 million in net restructuring charges and lower R&D and SG&A expenses; its negotiation and execution of settlement agreements with Apple and its contract manufacturers to “dismiss all outstanding litigation” and recognize minimum non-refundable royalties, thereby “enhanc[ing] stability for the long term” and preserving business continuity; proactive legal risk mitigation in FTC v. Qualcomm, where the company “filed a motion to stay certain of the remedies” and appealed injunctive relief, reflecting crisis response mechanisms and organizational flexibility; adaptation to evolving industry dynamics—from “lengthening of replacement cycles” and the transition to 5G to fluctuations in device demand—through adjustments in inventory levels, cash flow management, and revision of revenue recognition policies to estimate and accelerate sales-based royalties; financial resilience via tax restructuring in response to the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including “check-the-box” elections by foreign subsidiaries that generated a $570 million income tax benefit and a $2.5 billion deferred tax asset derecognition under new IRS regulations; strategic capital allocation through a $30 billion stock repurchase program, dividend increases, maintenance of $12.3 billion in cash, a $5 billion unused credit facility, and $15.5 billion in long-term debt issuances; continued investment in foundational technologies, 5G R&D and diversification into automotive, IoT and networking to sustain competitive advantage and support organizational transformation; and ongoing efforts to educate industry participants and governments, pursue inter-organizational collaboration in standard-setting and “anticipate, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change,” all of which contribute to the preservation or enhancement of functioning and performance under adverse conditions.

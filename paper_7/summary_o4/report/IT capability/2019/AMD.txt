In our 2019 fiscal year, we executed the multi-year product roadmap through the launch of our 7-nanometer product portfolio for PC, graphics and server markets, introducing high-performance Ryzen, Threadripper, Radeon and EPYC processors to address evolving market demand and maintain operational flexibility. Net revenue increased to $6.7 billion with gross margin improving to 43% in 2019 from 38% in 2018, driven by a richer mix of high-margin Ryzen and EPYC products, reflecting our ability to reconfigure resource allocation and preserve performance under a dynamic environment. We significantly strengthened our balance sheet, increasing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to $1.5 billion, reducing total debt from $1.5 billion to $563 million, and securing a revolving credit facility to ensure continuity of funding for capital expenditures and operations over the next 12 months while maintaining access to capital markets. Operating cash flow rose to $493 million from $34 million, largely attributable to changes in working capital, including higher cash collections and timing of payables, demonstrating our adaptability in financial resource management. We manage inventory risk by evaluating ending inventory for excess quantities and obsolescence based on projected sales outlook, adjusting inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value using historical activity and forecasted demand. Through seasonally and cyclically varying operating segments, we monitor market conditions and product transitions to mitigate potential strains on revenue. Our critical accounting processes, including revenue recognition provisions for returns and allowances, qualitative and quantitative goodwill impairment analyses, and ongoing reassessment of deferred tax asset valuation allowances, illustrate our systemic approach to risk assessment and preservation of organizational integrity under internal and external pressures. The recognition of a $60 million IP licensing gain and increased go-to-market activities reflect strategic inter-organizational collaborations and resource investments designed to enhance our resilience and competitive position in a turbulent market environment.

Visa has reinforced its resilience by operating a fast, secure and reliable global payments network across more than 200 countries and territories, supported by ongoing investments in technology, infrastructure and facilities to sustain business continuity and digital innovation; it manages external pressures such as exchange-rate volatility through a hedging program that mitigated net-revenue impacts by approximately 1.5 percentage points while maintaining forecasting and budgeting processes that project liquidity sufficiency for more than the next 12 months; treasury policies are designed to provide adequate working capital, ensure timely settlement of client obligations and fund litigation liabilities, including a $1.2 billion U.S. litigation escrow account under its retrospective responsibility plan and a U.K. plan for legacy litigation, thereby isolating shareholders from certain legal risks; to further mitigate interest-rate and currency exposures and reduce borrowing costs, Visa entered into interest-rate and cross-currency swaps on a portion of its debt; global credit settlement risk procedures, including collateral requirements for clients below credit standards, reduce settlement-related counterparty risk; and the company continuously reconfigures its capital allocation—through targeted share repurchases, dividend payments and adjustments to client incentives—so as to absorb strain, preserve system integrity and maintain performance under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

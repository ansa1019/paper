Within our integrated ecosystem, our products are designed to decrease variability in surgery by offering dependable, consistent functionality and user experiences for surgeons seeking better outcomes, reflecting a systemic perspective that maintains performance under internal or external variations. To provide operational flexibility and mitigate risks of underutilization and credit exposure, we have developed alternative financing structures such as sales-type leases, operating leases, and usage-based arrangements, which we have found effective and are prepared to expand in response to customer demand. We introduce new systems—such as the da Vinci SP and ION endoluminal platforms—in a measured fashion, placing systems first with experienced users while we optimize training pathways, supply-chain processes, and collect additional clinical data, thereby enhancing our capacity to absorb strain and preserve functionality under supply and market constraints. We have increased inventory levels to address growth and to mitigate risks of disruption arising from trade, supply, or other matters, and we deploy foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated foreign currency-denominated sales and expenses, preserving financial integrity under currency fluctuations. We believe that cash provided by operations, along with our cash equivalents and investments, will meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future, demonstrating resilience in our ability to generate and allocate financial resources. Furthermore, the acquisition of endoscope manufacturing assets from Schölly Fiberoptic is intended to integrate critical manufacturing operations across multiple sites globally, reducing reliance on external suppliers and enhancing our dynamic capabilities to respond to complex operational challenges. Our structured field action processes, including stringent documentation and customer support for recalls and corrections, serve as mechanisms to maintain system integrity and recover from exceptional conditions, ensuring continuity of operations and organizational adaptability under evolving regulatory and safety requirements.

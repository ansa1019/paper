In item 7, the company describes a strategic transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smoke-free future by replacing cigarettes with smoke-free products, leveraging multidisciplinary product development capabilities, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation to absorb regulatory and market pressures, reconfigure its product portfolio and meet consumer and regulatory requirements under challenging conditions. It operates in six geographic segments and dynamically adjusts its product mix and pricing to manage volume, mix and currency fluctuations, demonstrating operational flexibility and resource reallocation to preserve performance across EU, EE, ME&A, S&SA, EA&A and LA&C markets. The company’s optimization of its capital structure—using existing cash to repay long-term debt, implementing tax planning measures and recording fair value adjustments for equity investments—reflects proactive risk mitigation and financial resilience. The recognition of asset impairment and exit costs for manufacturing plant closures as part of global manufacturing infrastructure optimization and the deconsolidation of its Canadian subsidiary through the CCAA process, with minimal disruption to customers, suppliers and employees, illustrate adaptive reconfiguration and legal contingency management to maintain continuity and integrity of operations under adverse conditions. These measures collectively indicate the organization’s capacity to absorb strain, reconfigure resources and preserve or improve functioning and performance despite external disturbances and regulatory, legal and market challenges.

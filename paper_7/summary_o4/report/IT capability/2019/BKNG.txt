Management acknowledges that the recent coronavirus outbreak has had a significant and negative impact on the business and that the “ultimate impact of the outbreak on our business is impossible to predict with certainty,” underscoring the need for adaptive operational responses. The company describes increased collaboration, cooperation and interdependency among its brands, sharing resources and technological innovations, co-developing new services and coordinating activities across key markets to improve operational flexibility, resource deployment and systemic resilience. Booking.com’s strategic shift to merchant transaction processing “allows booking.com to process transactions for travel service providers and to increase its ability to offer secure and flexible transaction terms to consumers,” illustrating a reconfiguration of capabilities in response to evolving customer needs. The use of derivative instruments to minimize the impact of short-term foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and maintenance of a multi-year unsecured revolving credit facility to support working capital, acquisitions and general corporate purposes are cited as risk-mitigation and liquidity-management measures. Management further emphasizes ongoing investments in performance and brand marketing, technology, data center capacity and personnel, adjusting spend based on channel-specific returns on investment to sustain growth and profitability under volatile market conditions. The MD&A identifies uncontrollable factors—pandemics, natural disasters, economic and political uncertainties—that “can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumers” and notes that these events “have negatively affected our business and results of operations in the past and may do so again in the future,” highlighting the company’s preparedness orientation and its capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning in the face of adversity.

Managementâ€™s discussion and analysis is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the consolidated financial statements and related notes to enhance the understanding of our operations and our present business environment. Our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies, while technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and challenging existing business models. Consumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content, which has and likely will continue to reduce the number of our video customers and intensify audience fragmentation, even as it makes high-speed internet services more important to consumers. We believe our X1 platform helps us compete more effectively against this competition, and we continue to employ sales and marketing programs, including promotions, bundled service offerings and service offerings targeted at specific market segments. We offer a broad variety of products and services to businesses, including high-speed internet, voice, video, cloud-based cybersecurity and business continuity services, software-defined networking, cellular backhaul and advanced voice and video solutions, and larger enterprises may also receive support services related to business continuity risks, network security and router management. We believe adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses, including residential high-speed internet and business services, and we expect the number of residential voice customers and voice revenue will continue to decline. We anticipate our capital expenditures for 2020 will be focused on continued investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity, increased investment in line extensions for the expansion of both business services and residential, and the continued deployment of wireless gateways, our X1 platform, cloud DVR technology, Sky Q and international OTT platforms. We believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing credit facilities; and our ability to obtain future external financing. We maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facilities and our commercial paper programs to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, and as of December 31, 2019 we met our leverage covenant by a significant margin and do not expect to have to reduce debt or improve operating results in order to continue to comply. We paused our share repurchase program in order to accelerate the reduction of indebtedness we incurred in connection with the acquisition of Sky and no common shares were repurchased in 2019 under the authorization. In August 2019, we entered into a collateralized obligation, and in November 2019 we issued senior notes, with proceeds used to repay debt, and in January 2020 our board approved a 10% increase in our dividend to $0.92 per share on an annualized basis. We plan to launch Peacock in 2020 and expect to incur significant costs to develop and scale our direct-to-consumer streaming service. Each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations, and we assess the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including cable franchise rights, annually or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired, performing qualitative and quantitative assessments based on discounted cash flow analyses that consider estimated future cash flows and appropriate discount rates. We capitalize film and television production costs, including direct production costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest, and we amortize these capitalized costs using the individual film forecast computation method based on the ratio of current period revenue to estimated total remaining revenue, regularly updating our estimates of ultimate revenue based on historical performance and current market trends, and subject capitalized film and television costs to impairment testing when triggering events are identified. We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values using reproduction and replacement cost approaches for property and equipment and relief-from-royalty methods for trade names, periodically evaluating our reporting units and units of account to ensure impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level and to maintain the integrity and performance of our system under internal and external variations and disturbances.

Our MD&A emphasizes that our growth strategy depends on our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, enter new markets, and drive broad adoption of our products and services, and on strengthening third-party relationships; to remain competitive and continue to grow, we are investing significant resources in product development, marketing, sales, information technology infrastructure, and privacy and security capabilities, implementing additional security measures and collaborating with industry and government to protect our customers and ensure the ongoing operation and availability of our platforms and those of our external service providers; we recognize that disruptive start-ups, emerging ecosystems and mega-platforms are creating a more dynamic and highly competitive environment where customer expectations shift as services become digitized, and we view these external pressures both as risks to be mitigated and as drivers of strategic adaptation; our liquidity and capital resources—comprising cash from operations, investments, and borrowings under secured and unsecured credit facilities—alongside disciplined debt service, covenant compliance, and contractual obligations under leases and credit agreements, support our ability to absorb strain and preserve operational continuity under seasonal fluctuations and economic uncertainties, thereby enabling us to meet working capital needs, fund capital projects, execute strategic acquisitions, and sustain share repurchases and dividend programs; we continually evaluate the merits of acquiring technology or businesses and of establishing strategic relationships, leveraging our strong liquidity profile to reconfigure resources and respond quickly to emerging opportunities; we adopt new accounting standards and conduct annual impairment assessments of goodwill and acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate potential unrecoverability, estimate and adjust provisions for legal contingencies and uncertain tax positions as additional information becomes available, and update valuation models for performance-based awards to reflect changes in forecasted cash flows, market conditions, and probability of achievement, all of which reflect our ongoing commitment to maintain integrity and performance, at least partially, while under internal or external variations and disturbances.

Management’s discussion and analysis discloses that Procter & Gamble’s forward‐looking statements, based on current expectations and assumptions, are subject to risks and uncertainties from global macroeconomic conditions, commodity price volatility, foreign exchange fluctuations, government policies and competitive activities, and P&G undertakes no obligation to update these projections. The company’s organizational resilience is supported by its multi‐layered global structure of global business units, selling and market operations, global business services and corporate functions, and by recent organization design changes effective July 1, 2019, which reorganized ten product categories into six sector business units responsible for global brand strategy, innovation, supply plans and operating frameworks to drive growth and value creation across focus and enterprise markets. Since 2012, P&G has implemented a multi‐year productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in supply chain, research and development, marketing and overhead, streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes, engaging in outsourcing projects and workforce optimization, and delivering through June 30, 2019 approximately $3.6 billion in annual before‐tax gross savings. In periods of significant macroeconomic pressures, the company maintains a disciplined approach to investing so as not to sacrifice the long-term health of its businesses, balancing top-line growth, bottom-line growth and strong cash generation, reinvesting productivity improvements and cost savings in product and packaging improvements, brand awareness-building advertising, trial-building sampling programs, increased sales coverage and R&D programs. P&G manages risk through monetization of key metrics—unit volume growth, net sales growth, operating margins, adjusted free cash flow productivity and organic sales growth—through formal risk management policies governing pricing actions, cost savings initiatives, sourcing decisions, and derivative hedging of interest rates, currency rates and commodity exposures, and maintains strong short- and long-term credit ratings and undrawn bank credit facilities to ensure liquidity. Operating cash flow of $15.2 billion in fiscal 2019 provided the primary source of cash to fund operating needs, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions—including the Merck OTC acquisition and the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership—while segment results and overall financial condition reflect the company’s ability to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning despite internal and external variations, and emerge stronger from challenging conditions through continuous organizational change processes, operational flexibility, strategic initiatives, resource reconfiguration and a consumer-centric, innovation-driven business model.

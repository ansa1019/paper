We describe that in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions, judgments and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, evaluate those assumptions, judgments and estimates on a regular basis and discuss them with the audit committee of the board of directors, while acknowledging that unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. In connection with our acquisitions, we allocate the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date, making significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets, deferred revenue obligations, expected cash flows, attrition rates, acquired trade names and discount rates, and we recognize that unanticipated events and circumstances may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions. We believe that investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to remain competitive and directly related to timely development of new and enhanced offerings, and we continue to implement strategies to accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of our cloud subscription offerings. We utilize a direct sales force and an extensive ecosystem of partners, have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and enter into structured stock repurchase agreements to manage share price volatility and return value to stockholders. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from income tax examinations, maintain reserves for potential adjustments, and believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, anticipated cash flows from operations and available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.

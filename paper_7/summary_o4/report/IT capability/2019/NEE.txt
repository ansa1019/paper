Nextera Energy’s management discussion describes a suite of strategies and resource commitments that support the company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve performance under internal and external disturbances, including maintaining liquidity through cash flows from operations, borrowings, short- and long-term debt issuances, equity offerings, proceeds from sales of differential membership interests and asset disposals to support and grow its businesses; employing derivative instruments (energy, interest rate and foreign currency swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in commodity markets and interest rates, deferring mark-to-market changes under cost recovery clauses to reduce earnings volatility, and using value-at-risk models and master netting agreements to monitor market and credit exposure; establishing storm funds, reserve amortization mechanisms and operational efficiencies to handle restoration costs following hurricanes Irma and Dorian and maintain targeted regulatory return on equity; investing in plant in service and other property, including adding 1,125 MW of new wind generating capacity, 1,091 MW of wind repowering capacity and 512 MW of solar capacity and increasing its backlog of contracted renewable projects to adapt to changing environmental and customer demands; reconfiguring its asset portfolio through sales of NEP interests, deconsolidation of Nextera Energy Partners and the sale of its fiber-optic telecommunications business; allocating adjusted earnings as a non-GAAP measure for financial planning, board reporting and performance-based compensation to align incentives with fundamental earnings power; maintaining, on a long-term basis, a capital structure designed to support a strong investment-grade credit rating, complying with debt covenants, securing revolving credit facilities and issuing guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds to provide business continuity in the event of collateral requirements; and funding nuclear decommissioning and other asset retirement obligations through special use funds invested in diversified fixed-income and equity securities to ensure system integrity. These practices collectively reflect the organization’s multifaceted capabilities for risk mitigation, adaptation, resource reconfiguration and recovery, enabling sustained functioning and competitive resilience under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

The company reports that it “has pioneered the next generation of security through our innovative platform that empowers enterprises, service providers, and government entities to secure their organizations by safely enabling applications and data running in their networks, on their endpoints, and in the cloud, and by preventing breaches that stem from targeted cyberattacks,” and that its “innovative traffic classification engine … provides consistent security across the network, endpoint, and cloud,” thereby enabling end-customers “to pursue transformative digital initiatives … while maintaining the visibility and control needed to protect their valued data and critical control systems.” It believes this architecture “offers superior performance compared to legacy approaches and reduces the total cost of ownership for organizations by simplifying their security operations and infrastructure and eliminating the need for multiple, stand-alone hardware and software security products,” reflecting a strategic resource reconfiguration to enhance operational flexibility. The company states that “we continue to invest in innovation as we evolve and further extend the capabilities of our platform, as we believe that innovation and timely development of new features and products is essential to meeting the needs of our end-customers and improving our competitive position,” and that the “growth of our business and our short-term and long-term success are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to extend our technology leadership, grow our base of end-customers, expand deployment of our platform and support offerings within existing end-customers, and focus on end-customer satisfaction.” To “manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner,” all measures that preserve functioning under strain. It highlights that it “monitors cash flow provided by operating activities … to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business,” remains in compliance with its “$400.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility,” and believes that “our cash flow from operations with existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future,” while also deploying capital through acquisitions—“in October 2018, we acquired Redlock; in March 2019, we acquired Demisto; and in June and July 2019, we acquired PureSec and Twistlock”—and exercising share repurchases “funded from available working capital,” all of which serve as strategic resilience mechanisms to absorb external pressures, mitigate risk, and maintain performance under dynamic conditions.

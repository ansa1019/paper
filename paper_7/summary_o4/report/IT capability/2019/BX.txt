Blackstone’s management discussion acknowledges that “our business is materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in the U.S., Europe, Asia and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere in the world,” and that “the composition of our revenues will vary based on market conditions and the cyclicality of the different businesses in which we operate,” reflecting a systemic perspective on performance under pressure.  It notes that 2019 “was characterized by rising global markets and continued economic expansion, despite uncertainty related to trade disputes, geopolitical risks and yield curve inversions in the U.S. and around the world,” and that “volatility moderated slightly in 2019, with the VIX index averaging 15.4, down 5% from the 2018 average,” yet cautions that “geopolitical instability continues to pose risk.”  In particular, it highlights that “the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus in many countries … has disrupted global travel and supply chains, and has adversely impacted global commercial activity and a number of industries” and that “the rapid development and fluidity of this situation precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact … which may have a continued adverse impact on economic and market conditions and trigger a period of global economic slowdown.”  Throughout, Blackstone emphasizes its use of “certain financial measures and key operating metrics” to monitor productivity and the effectiveness of “our value creating strategies” across private equity, real estate, hedge fund solutions and credit segments, and describes how “fair values are affected by changes in the fundamentals of our portfolio companies … the overall economy and other market conditions,” underscoring its focus on adaptation, resource allocation and performance maintenance in the face of external pressures and unexpected events.

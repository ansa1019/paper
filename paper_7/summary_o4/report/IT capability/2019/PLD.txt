During the year ended December 31, 2019, operating fundamentals remained strong for our operating and managed portfolio, with high occupancy sustained at 96.5% despite a strategic focus on rental rate growth which produced a 23.7% weighted average net effective rent change. To enhance our adaptive capacity, we formed PBLV, a Brazilian co-investment venture, contributed a 7 million square foot portfolio and received $620 million of proceeds and, excluding that contribution, generated net proceeds of $2.4 billion and realized $719 million in net gains from property contributions to co-investment ventures in Europe, Japan and the U.S. We expanded strategic capital revenues through promotes aggregating $181 million and completed financing transactions that extended average debt maturities to 7.8 years while lowering our effective interest rate to 2.2%, including upsizing our $3.5 billion global senior credit facility, entering multiple unsecured term loans and issuing â‚¬1.8 billion of senior notes, thereby maintaining $3.7 billion of available borrowing capacity and $4.8 billion in total liquidity. Subsequent to year end, we executed a $13 billion Liberty transaction via equity issuance and debt assumption, demonstrating our capacity to reconfigure capital under external pressures. We manage business operations on an ownership-blind O&M basis across consolidated and unconsolidated properties, retaining over 70% of customers on lease commencements, and evaluate performance through NOI by segment as a supplemental measure to understand our operational resilience. We consider our ability to generate cash from operating activities, co-investment venture distributions, property dispositions and diverse financing sources as adequate to meet development, acquisition, debt service and dividend requirements and to sustain liquidity. Our financing strategy, supported by A3/A- credit ratings and compliance with all covenants, and our use of equity and debt commitments in multiple markets illustrate our systemic approach to risk mitigation and resource mobilization. Additionally, we routinely realign our portfolio through acquisitions, dispositions, development starts and stabilizations totaling multi-billion dollar capital investments while preserving sufficient unrestricted cash balances. Our disciplined capital allocation, diversified funding, contractual debt maturities management and comprehensive liquidity planning underpin our capacity to absorb strain, maintain performance, and evolve under varying environmental and financial conditions.

Goldman Sachs’ MD&A emphasizes an integrated enterprise resilience framework, anchored by its business continuity program, contingency funding plan and dynamic balance‐sheet planning, which collectively seek to maintain integrity and performance under challenging conditions by pre‐funding potential cash and collateral needs through a global core liquid assets portfolio and diversified funding sources across markets, products and maturities. Treasury and independent risk oversight collaborate to project balance‐sheet needs, set and periodically adjust risk limits and thresholds, and conduct regular and ad hoc stress tests—including internally developed severely adverse scenarios—which inform capital planning, intraday and 30-day liquidity models and strategic funding decisions. A multilayered governance structure, comprising firmwide and business-level risk committees, escalates limit breaches, oversees scenario analyses of liquidity, market, credit and operational risks, and reviews new activities for evolving complexity. Robust controls over valuation models, independent price and model validation processes, and collateral and hedge arrangements mitigate counterparty credit exposures, while continuous monitoring of technology resilience, third-party dependencies and key operational metrics ensures rapid reconfiguration of resources, operational flexibility and sustained delivery of critical functions through market volatility and system-wide shocks.

The company states that “strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, focused research projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience,” while “productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its practical process improvement (ppi) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing.” The augmentation of internal growth with complementary acquisitions and divestitures, including year-over-year acquisitions of $1.84 billion and divestiture proceeds of $1.13 billion, reflects resource reconfiguration and realignment toward core operations. The company reports that it “intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available” under its $2.50 billion revolving credit facility and believes that “its existing cash and cash equivalents of $2.40 billion as of December 31, 2019 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.” Risk mitigation is further supported by “accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims” based on probabilities and actuarial estimates, as well as by “off-balance sheet instruments such as letters of credit, bank guarantees, residual value guarantees under leases, surety bonds and other guarantees.” The company “evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value,” with triggering events that include “unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts.” Through targeted restructuring actions—“charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, net charges to selling, general and administrative expenses, principally transaction and integration-related costs related to acquisitions and a divestiture,” and “cash restructuring charges, net, primarily for employee severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities”—the company forecasts annual cost savings of $60 million beginning in part in 2019 and in greater measure in 2020. Income tax and deferred tax planning measures, including recognition of a $62 million benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes and foreign tax credit planning, illustrate adaptation of financial resource strategies under varying tax regimes. The consolidated summary of “contractual obligations and other commercial commitments” detailing debt maturities, interest, operating and finance lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations further underscores preparedness for future cash outflows and continuity under diverse financial conditions.

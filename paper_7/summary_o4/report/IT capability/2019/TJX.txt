In response to the emergence and rapid evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has engaged in continuous monitoring of governmental directives and public health guidance, closed all stores, online businesses, distribution centers and offices with associates working remotely where possible, committed to pay associates through specified periods, and is managing phased store reopenings by state and locality, actions designed to preserve continuity of operations and maintain organizational functioning under adversity. To further strengthen its financial resilience, TJX suspended its share repurchase program, reviewed operating expenses, evaluated merchandise purchases, reduced capital expenditures, drew down $1.0 billion on revolving credit facilities, withdrew near-term guidance and deferred dividend decisions, measures intended to shore up liquidity and flexibility in an uncertain environment. In parallel, the company has assessed and mitigated risks stemming from Brexit by evaluating a range of potential outcomes, pinpointing areas of concern, realigning its European supply chain to reduce cross-border merchandise flows, establishing dedicated resources and systems to support the plan, communicating new immigration requirements to associates and preparing for possible customs duties and economic headwinds. The company also actively monitors and hedges foreign currency and tariff exposures, routinely entering into inventory-related derivatives to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on merchandise costs and assessing U.S. import tariffsâ€™ effects on margin, pricing and consumer demand. TJX believes its existing cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and credit facilities are adequate to absorb strain, preserve operating flexibility and support the maintenance of positive adjustment and performance under challenging conditions.

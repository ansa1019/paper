The company’s discussion highlights its response to a 23% revenue decline in 2019 “primarily due to pricing declines resulting from the challenging memory market environment,” as well as the adverse impact of underutilization of IMFT assets on gross margin, prompting management to “continue to evaluate planned technology node transitions, capital spending and re-use rates for NAND equipment,” including a change in depreciable life to improve cost structure.  It emphasizes that cash generated from operations “is highly dependent on selling prices” that “can vary significantly,” and that the company is “continuously evaluating alternatives for efficiently funding our capital expenditures and ongoing operations,” expects its “cash and investments, cash flows from operations, and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through the next 12 months,” and intends to invest $7 billion to $8 billion in 2020 “focused on technology transitions and product enablement.”  To manage financial risk and preserve operational continuity, it maintains undrawn revolving and term credit facilities, “to mitigate credit risk, we invest through high-credit-quality financial institutions and by policy generally limit the concentration of credit exposure,” and pursues capital markets transactions—including the issuance of notes and a discretionary share repurchase authorization of $10 billion—to reconfigure its capital structure.  Collaborative R&D cost-sharing agreements with Intel support new product and process development while reducing net R&D expense, and the planned draw on a term loan to acquire Intel’s IMFT interest reflects proactive resource deployment to reconstitute joint‐venture capabilities.  Inventory lower-of-cost-or-net-realizable-value adjustments are based on forecasts of selling prices and volumes, and impairment reviews of property, plant and equipment and goodwill use forward-looking cash-flow estimates and discount rates, evidencing ongoing risk assessment and adaptation of accounting resources.  These strategic initiatives, financing arrangements, resource reallocations, collaborative agreements and valuation practices collectively illustrate the company’s efforts to absorb strain, maintain liquidity and preserve or improve functioning under market volatility.

We continually adjust our air and ground network to better align capacity with demand and deploy technology to increase package sorting and delivery productivity by reducing manual touchpoints, underpinned by ongoing investments in automated facilities and transformation initiatives designed to absorb strain and preserve functioning under volume fluctuations. Our fuel surcharges, indexed to DOE energy prices and adjusted weekly, and our hedging programs for foreign currency and interest rate exposures, help mitigate revenue and cost volatility arising from external disturbances. We supplement GAAP results with adjusted financial measures that exclude transformation strategy costs, legal contingencies and mark-to-market pension charges to remove short-term volatility in market interest rates, equity prices and other financial perturbations, thereby providing a clearer baseline for assessing underlying performance, guiding resource allocation and supporting business continuity. We believe our strong cash position, access to commercial paper programs and debt capital markets, and cash flow from operations should be adequate not only for operating requirements but also to fund capital expenditures, transformation strategy, dividend payments, share repurchases, pension contributions and long-term debt obligations through the next several years, while our ongoing evaluation of capital structure—including periodic debt or equity issuances to refinance existing obligations—enhances our ability to respond effectively and emerge stronger from challenging situations. Commitments to acquire aircraft, vehicles, equipment and real estate ensure the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated growth, and our activity-based costing methodologies, refined periodically, enable the continuous alignment of expense allocations to changing business conditions, all of which contribute to our organizational resilience through strategic flexibility, risk mitigation and maintenance of performance under pressure.

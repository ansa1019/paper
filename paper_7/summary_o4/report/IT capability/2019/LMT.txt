Operating in an environment characterized by both complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures, management focuses on program execution by improving the quality and predictability of delivery and placing security capabilities quickly and affordably into the hands of customers, while recognizing resource constraints and extending the portfolio in adjacent markets. We continuously strengthen our portfolio through independent research and development and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities to adapt to changing conditions, and we collaborate internationally via partnerships, joint technology efforts and foreign military sales. Our contracts are monitored for technical, schedule and cost risks, and profit booking rates are adjusted as risk retirements occur or conditions deteriorate; reserves have been recorded for performance issues on programs such as the ground-based radar, EADGE-T command and control system, LM 2100 satellite platforms and the Warrior turret upgrade. To mitigate supply chain risk on the F-35 program after Turkey’s suspension, we are working with the DoD to identify and qualify alternate suppliers to ensure continuity of production. Our balanced cash deployment strategy—leveraging strong operating cash flows, credit facilities and cash from operations—supports capital expenditures, R&D and selective acquisitions, preserves liquidity, funds dividends and share repurchases, and underpins business continuity. We have de-risked pension obligations by completing the freeze of salaried defined benefit plans and executing annuity buy-out and buy-in contracts to stabilize future funding requirements. Environmental remediation liabilities are measured and recovered under U.S. government regulations, reflecting reasonable estimates for potential costs while maintaining operational integrity. Backlog growth, forward-looking net sales and operating profit projections, ongoing risk assessment and strategic resource allocation demonstrate our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity.

Microsoft’s MD&A notes that its industry “is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models,” and that “each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business.” The company asserts that “we must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment,” directing investments in infrastructure, devices, research and development and acquisitions aligned with its strategy, while acknowledging that “the investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.” It emphasizes that its “success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees” and that it “competes for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.” The MD&A further recognizes that aggregate demand is “correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic,” and describes the use of derivative instruments “to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; enhance investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification.” In support of liquidity and business continuity, Microsoft holds cash, cash equivalents and short‐term investments “primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation,” consisting “predominantly of highly liquid investment‐grade fixed‐income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers,” with “credit risk and average maturity of our fixed‐income portfolio … managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed‐income indices.” The company also provides indemnifications against intellectual property and security claims, evaluating “the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss,” and is subject to a one‐time transition tax on deferred foreign income payable interest‐free over eight years. Microsoft maintains operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, retail stores and equipment, and states that “we expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short‐term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities … for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.” Finally, the company acknowledges that preparing its consolidated financial statements “requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses,” and identifies as critical its accounting policies and judgments in revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes and inventories.

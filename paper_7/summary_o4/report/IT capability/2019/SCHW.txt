Charles Schwab has established a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework approved by the Board of Directors that defines risk appetite and engages executive management, a Global Risk Committee, and specialized sub-committees covering operational, compliance, financial, model, incentive compensation and new-product risks to identify, assess, measure and monitor risks inherent in people, processes, systems and third-party relationships. Policies, procedures and internal controls—reinforced by regular risk and control self-assessments, internal audits and reporting—are designed to keep operational, credit, market, liquidity and compliance risks within pre-approved tolerance levels and to mitigate potential financial and reputational impacts. To preserve business continuity and system integrity under internal or external disruptions, the firm maintains a geographically dispersed backup and recovery infrastructure, routine testing of disaster-recovery plans, backup communications and a robust incident-management program. An information-security program integrates complementary tools, controls and technologies to protect systems, client accounts and data, while dedicated fraud prevention, conduct, fiduciary and model-governance programs address unauthorized activity and decision-support errors. Liquidity and capital management policies require regular stress testing under normal and stressed conditions, maintenance of diverse funding sources and committed facilities, insurance coverage and a capital contingency plan that is reviewed annually. The company conducts net interest-revenue and economic-value-of-equity simulations, monitors early-warning indicators, and employs these resilience strategies to ensure access to resources, operational flexibility and the preservation of performance and integrity through fluctuating interest rates, market volatility and other challenging conditions.

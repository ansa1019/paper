The Company reports that it continuously monitors global macroeconomic conditions and adapts its operating model to sustain performance under pressure, including the adoption of new revenue recognition rules and evolving data‐capture methodologies for end‐market categorization, the maintenance of diversified cash and credit facilities (including a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility and term loans refinanced to match cash‐flow requirements), and the use of interest rate and foreign currency hedges to mitigate market volatility. In response to shifting demand and cost pressures, the Company has undertaken restructuring actions—repositioning its global workforce skill set, writing off nonstrategic intellectual property, consolidating wafer and test operations, closing select facilities and reallocating capacity to internal sites and external foundries—expected to yield approximately $108 million of net annualized savings. The Company maintains substantial liquidity, with $648 million in cash and equivalents held in high‐credit counterparties and anticipates that existing resources and anticipated financing will support operations, R&D, capital expenditures and dividend payments for at least the next twelve months. A robust R&D program with hundreds of ongoing projects, coupled with disciplined inventory valuation and impairment reviews, underscores the Company’s commitment to innovation and risk assessment. Through comprehensive analyses of long-lived assets, goodwill, business combinations and contingent liabilities, the Company applies judgment and historical experience to preserve system integrity and performance, ensuring positive adjustment under challenging conditions and reinforcing organizational resilience in a turbulent environment.

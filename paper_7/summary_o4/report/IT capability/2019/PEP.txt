In our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we describe an integrated risk management framework that seeks to identify, assess, prioritize, manage, monitor and communicate risks enterprise‐wide—leveraging board and committee oversight, cross‐functional senior management risk committees and a centralized risk management office—to support business continuity, positive adjustment under challenging conditions and performance maintenance despite economic, political, social and environmental disturbances. Our “Winning with Purpose” strategy explicitly addresses shifting consumer preferences, a highly competitive operating environment and macroeconomic, regulatory and political volatility by investing in consumer‐centric capabilities and technology, optimizing cost structures, fortifying our manufacturing and supply chain footprint, transforming our organizational structure and talent, and focusing our sustainability agenda on areas such as water stewardship, climate change and packaging innovation to enhance adaptability, resource reconfiguration and long‐term sustainable growth. We continuously monitor unstable jurisdictions facing civil unrest, natural disasters, currency fluctuations, taxes and regulatory changes and employ global purchasing programs, commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate hedging, and working capital management to mitigate potential disruptions. Through multi-year productivity plans, we are simplifying, harmonizing and automating processes; re-engineering go-to-market and information systems; and streamlining our organization to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning while deploying resources effectively toward strategic initiatives. We maintain substantial liquidity and capital resources—through operating cash flow, commercial paper programs, revolving credit and bridge-loan facilities, share repurchases and disciplined dividends—to ensure financial resilience and operational continuity in turbulent markets. Our use of non-GAAP measures, including organic revenue growth, free cash flow and return on invested capital, aligns our performance evaluation and resource allocation with our resilience objectives. Finally, our selective acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures—such as the acquisition of Sodastream, refranchising initiatives and pension risk mitigation through group annuity purchases—demonstrate our ability to reconstitute and reconfigure organizational trajectories and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

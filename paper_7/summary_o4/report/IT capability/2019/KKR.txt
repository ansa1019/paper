The Company’s disclosures describe its resilience in terms of maintaining business continuity and adaptability amid challenging and volatile market conditions by diversifying across geographies and asset classes, dynamically reallocating resources and capital, and having robust liquidity and financing structures in place.  Management highlights that “global and regional economic conditions have substantial impact on our financial condition and results of operations,” yet also that “periods of volatility and dislocation in the capital markets present substantial risks, but also can present us with opportunities to invest at reduced valuations that position us for future growth and investment returns.”  The firm’s ability “to grow our revenues depends in part on our ability to attract new capital and investors,” and its “ability to maintain and grow our revenue base is dependent upon our ability to successfully deploy the capital available to us and participate in capital markets transactions,” reflecting its strategic agility in resource deployment.  The Company “manages our liquidity and capital requirements by focusing on our cash flows before the consolidation of our funds and cfes,” maintains access to “funding under various credit facilities, debt offerings, and other borrowing arrangements,” and holds capital commitments and underwriting commitments that it expects to call or syndicate over time.  Risk management and forward‐looking assessment of economic, political, regulatory, market and technological pressures are integral to its approach, with ongoing “forward‐looking statements” and “risk factors” disclosures detailing potential disturbances and constraints.  This systemic perspective on capital raising, investment flexibility, financing and contingency planning, together with continuous monitoring of macroeconomic developments and contractual liquidity sources, illustrates the Company’s capacity to absorb strain, adapt its operations, preserve financial health and sustain performance under external pressures and disruptions.

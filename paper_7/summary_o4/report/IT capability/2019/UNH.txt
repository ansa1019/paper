In item 7, the company emphasizes its management of liquidity and financial position through continuous forecasting and management of cash, investments, working capital and capital structure to meet short-term and long-term obligations while preserving liquidity and financial flexibility; explains that operating cash flows from regulated and nonregulated businesses, supported by a commercial paper program backed by committed credit facilities, are deployed to expand operations through acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt repayment and shareholder returns via dividends and share repurchases; and notes the maintenance of a defined debt-to-debt-plus-equity covenant to ensure prudent leverage. It details regulatory adaptation and market-sustainable strategies such as actuarially sound pricing, ACA tax adjustments and a prudent posture on new and existing business, alongside care-delivery and payment modernization initiatives that leverage data analytics and value-based payment models to close gaps in care, control medical costs and foster provider collaboration. The MD&A further discloses critical accounting estimates for medical costs payable—applying completion factors and per-member per-month trend factors with sensitivity analyses to reserve for variable claim submission patterns and cost trends—as well as annual or event-driven goodwill impairment testing using qualitative and quantitative assessments and discounted cash flow models corroborated by market multiples to validate reporting unit fair values. Finally, the company highlights its investment policy limiting single-issuer exposure, diversified accounts receivable, and absence of significant credit concentrations, illustrating its risk management, resource reconfiguration and operational flexibility to absorb strain and preserve or improve performance under internal or external variations and disturbances.

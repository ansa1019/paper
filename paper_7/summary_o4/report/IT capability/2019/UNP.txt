In 2019, despite heavy snowfall, harsh winter conditions and widespread flooding that disrupted our network, we remained focused on implementing Unified Plan 2020, the company’s plan for operating a safe, reliable and efficient railroad by increasing reliability of our service product, reducing variability in network operations and improving resource utilization costs. Throughout significant operational change we continued to identify and manage risk and train our employees as their work environment changed, and in 2020 we will build on this multi-faceted approach to safety—utilizing technology, risk assessment, training and employee engagement, quality control and targeted capital investments—while expanding the deployment of Total Safety Culture, Courage to Care and Commit and forming an Operating Practices Command Center to identify causes of mainline service interruptions, develop solutions, and assist employees with best practices. We will also leverage data to detect rail defects, mitigate risk, improve or close crossings and educate the public and law enforcement about crossing safety. As part of Unified Plan 2020 and G55+0 initiatives, we will further increase service reliability, reduce variability, improve asset utilization and achieve at least $500 million of productivity savings by utilizing existing network capacity, running longer trains, reducing “car touches” and consolidating terminals, all while better aligning our management structure and decision-making processes to be more agile and responsive to customer needs. Looking ahead to 2020, our capital plan—approximately $3.1 billion—will devote 75 to 80 percent of investments to renew and improve existing infrastructure and make targeted capacity and facility enhancements designed to improve productivity and operational efficiency, with significant investments in locomotive modernization and freight car replacements. To preserve operational continuity under internal or external pressures, we maintain adequate liquidity resources—including a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, an $800 million receivables securitization facility, access to commercial paper and capital markets—and plan to fund our capital expenditures, share repurchases and strategic initiatives with cash provided by operations, asset dispositions and long-term debt issuances. Our 2019 record 60.6 percent operating ratio, flat operating income of $8.6 billion, free cash flow of $2.6 billion and improved workforce and locomotive productivity metrics underscore our ability to absorb strain and maintain or improve functioning under adverse conditions. We also employ actuarial analyses to estimate and accrue personal injury and environmental remediation liabilities across hundreds of sites, reinforcing our capacity to identify, assess and respond to hazards and legal contingencies. These combined measures of risk mitigation, resource reconfiguration, strategic agility and capital resilience reflect our ongoing effort to preserve system integrity and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

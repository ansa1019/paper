Management’s discussion and analysis emphasizes that certain statements are forward-looking and subject to substantial uncertainty and that there can be no assurance of success in implementing strategic initiatives amid prolonged credit-market difficulties or regulatory change.  The company underscores its resilience through initiatives to modernize the workplace for improved productivity and innovation, standardize and simplify technology, reduce cybersecurity risk while enhancing process maturity consistent with its risk appetite, maintain a strong commitment to quality via shared data processes and capabilities, and sustain a robust risk, internal control and compliance environment.  It highlights its strong financial position—cash on hand, operating cash flows and available revolver capacity are expected to meet foreseeable operating and recurring needs—and notes that its sole financial covenant, an indebtedness-to-cash-flow ratio limit, has never been exceeded.  Liquidity is managed through disciplined allocation of resources to ongoing investments, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends, debt repayment, capital expenditures and infrastructure.  A forward-looking framework launched in 2018 seeks to enhance foundational capabilities, evolve core businesses and pursue growth via adjacencies.  The company continuously reviews and implements changes required by new laws, regulations and self-regulatory rules—such as MiFID II, the EU Benchmark Regulation and IOSCO principles—while acknowledging that evolving regulatory regimes may increase costs or legal risks.  Across its segments, the company adapts to market volatility, competitive pressures and regulatory inquiries by adjusting contract terms, expanding product offerings, leveraging technology and reallocating resources to sustain operations, preserve margins and support future growth.

Our management discussion and analysis discloses a range of strategic and operational measures designed to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions, including sustained investments in generative AI across our product portfolio to enhance adaptability and customer responsiveness, the continual expansion and integration of our Customer 360 platform and Slack digital headquarters to improve systemic efficiency and cross-functional coordination, and targeted go-to-market refinements that allocate resources toward engagements generating higher revenues and lower attrition.  We have executed a multi-phase restructuring plan—reducing workforce by approximately ten percent, optimizing office footprints and realigning cost structures—to improve operating margins while maintaining core capabilities, and we anticipate further restructuring initiatives to drive ongoing operational efficiencies.  Supported by $14.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, a $3 billion unsecured credit facility and $10.2 billion of operating cash flow, we have the financial resources and liquidity flexibility necessary to manage external pressures such as foreign currency volatility, elongated sales cycles and macroeconomic uncertainty, to invest in scalable data center and infrastructure enhancements that reinforce system integrity, and to ensure continuity of operations and resilience in our service delivery.  We continue to manage attrition through customer programs and professional services adoption to sustain our subscription-based revenue stream, assess contractual and capital commitments to maintain working capital and support future growth, and uphold environmental, social and governance standards that promote transparency, stakeholder trust and long-term organizational strength.

Management emphasizes the company’s capacity for positive adjustment under challenging conditions by “managing our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis,” preserving operational flexibility across its diverse activities and maintaining “ample liquidity” through substantial holdings in cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury bills, with the principle that “financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire” and insisting “on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments.” Acknowledging that “to varying degrees, our operating businesses have been impacted by government and private sector actions … supply chain disruptions and government actions to slow inflation” and that “we cannot reliably predict the future economic effects of these events on our businesses,” the company applies systematic risk assessment practices in its insurance operations—considering “pre-tax incurred losses exceeding $150 million from a current year catastrophic event” significant, testing “the adequacy of the aggregate claim liabilities using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models and paid and incurred loss triangles,” revising unpaid loss estimates and deferred charges when expectations change, and utilizing “time-value-of-money” in pricing retroactive reinsurance to ensure long-term underwriting earnings. Its senior corporate management participates in “significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the chief executive” at operating businesses, and it “normally receives premiums at the contract inception date … available for investment,” reflecting strategic resource generation, deployment and reconfiguration in response to volatility. The company’s planning for recurring capital expenditures, structured debt maturities and contractual obligations further underscores its systemic perspective and future orientation, collectively forming a multifaceted resilience strategy to preserve performance and adapt under a broad array of external pressures.

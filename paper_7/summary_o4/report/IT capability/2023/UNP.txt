The company describes a range of initiatives and processes that contribute to its ability to absorb strain and maintain operations under challenging conditions, including changes to its safety program centered on training, culture and enhanced team communication informed by analysis of historical injury data and a focus on a small number of critical operating rules; the ongoing refinement of proprietary “precision train builder” software to simulate in-train forces, evaluate route characteristics and enable proactive intervention by its operating practices command center to prevent derailments; industry-wide adoption of enhanced data sharing standards, first responder training and real-time railcar condition monitoring technologies; strategic deployment of additional locomotives and the aggressive hiring and graduation of more than 1,900 train, engine and yard employees to backfill attrition and address operational challenges; continuous efforts to improve network fluidity—as measured by faster freight car velocity, lower terminal dwell, average train speed and locomotive productivity—to optimize resource utilization and operational flexibility; sustained free cash flow generation and scenario-based liquidity planning, including stress analyses of economic scenarios, maintenance of a revolving credit facility and a receivables facility, and readiness to access capital markets to ensure business continuity during extended periods of lower volumes; a 2024 capital plan focused on hardening infrastructure, replacing older assets, modernizing the locomotive fleet and targeted investments to enhance safety, resiliency and operational efficiency; a forward-looking approach to risk assessment and mitigation through data analytics to identify service interruptions, detect rail defects, improve crossings and educate stakeholders; and ongoing climate scenario analyses to understand environmental risks and guide investments in fuel-efficient operations, renewable fuels and low- or zero-emissions propulsion technologies—all of which, together, reflect a systemic perspective on resilience, enable positive adjustment under internal and external perturbations, and support the preservation or improvement of performance under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

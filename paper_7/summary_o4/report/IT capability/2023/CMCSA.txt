As disclosed in Note 2, we changed the presentation of our segment operating results in 2023 under a new segment structure, reflecting a reconfiguration of our reporting that supports strategic decision-making. We continue to focus on growing higher-margin businesses through disciplined operating cost management and by investing in our network to deliver higher-speed broadband and expand our coverage footprint, adapting our resource allocation to evolving market demands. An increasingly competitive environment and continued low domestic household move levels have had negative impacts on our customer relationships, and global economic conditions and consumer sentiment have in the past, and may continue to, adversely impact demand for our products and services and our results of operations, underscoring our ongoing risk assessment and operational flexibility. We operate our Media segment as a combined television and streaming business, mitigating declines in traditional network viewership by driving growth in Peacock subscribers and advertising revenue to address shifting consumption patterns, and we continue to incur significant content and marketing investments to support this transition. In our Theme Parks segment, we invest in existing and new attractions, hotels and infrastructure—including Epic Universe in Orlando—to reconstitute our growth trajectory following prior operating constraints, reflecting a focus on strategic resource deployment and future orientation. Our businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities and maintain substantial liquidity through available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, with quarterly testing of leverage covenants to ensure financial health and continuity. We anticipate allocating substantial portions of future cash flows to debt service, capital expenditures and intangible investments, business development and shareholder returns, thereby preserving our operational continuity and organizational functioning under diverse internal and external conditions. In addition, we routinely test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as cable franchise rights, for impairment when triggering events or economic pressures arise and apply qualitative and quantitative assessments to ensure the maintenance of integrity and performance in our carrying values.

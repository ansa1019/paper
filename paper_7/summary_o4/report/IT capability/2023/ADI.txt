During fiscal 2023, the company initiated global repositioning actions and a fourth‐quarter plan to reorganize its business—comprising voluntary and involuntary reductions‐in‐force, other cost‐savings initiatives and strategic workforce shifts—to adjust its cost structure and business activities in response to weaker market demand and continued economic uncertainty, while committing to ongoing research and development as essential to maintain product leadership and deliver innovative new offerings. The company invested $1.3 billion in property, plant and equipment to enhance its global resiliency and expects to invest $600 million to $800 million in fiscal 2024, funding these expenditures through cash on hand, future operating cash flows and existing and anticipated short‐ and long‐term financing. At October 28, 2023, its principal source of liquidity was $958.1 million of cash and cash equivalents held in the United States and various foreign subsidiaries, which it actively manages by reviewing available funds, assessing the cost effectiveness of repatriation, diversifying investments to minimize credit risk, and maintaining compliance with a $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and a $2.5 billion commercial paper program (of which $547.2 million was outstanding) to ensure continued funding of operations, capital expenditures, research and development and dividends for at least the next twelve months. Working capital management efforts included balancing manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels to support forecasted sales and mitigate supply‐chain variability, while the use of forward foreign‐currency exchange contracts, primarily to hedge euro exposure, further demonstrates its systematic approach to absorb strain, preserve operational integrity and maintain performance under internal and external pressures.

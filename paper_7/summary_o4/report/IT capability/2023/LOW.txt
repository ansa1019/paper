During fiscal 2023, in response to persistent macroeconomic pressures and uncertain customer demand, the company maintained operational flexibility and preserved profitability by emphasizing value and convenience, investing in omnichannel technology capabilities and pro customer offerings, and executing perpetual productivity improvement initiatives that controlled costs and enabled adaptive responses to demand fluctuations. Inventory management was aligned with sales trends and spring product build timing while tax payment deferrals were leveraged to optimize cash flows, reflecting resource reconfiguration and risk mitigation. Strategic capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividend increases were calibrated to support long-term growth objectives and enhance shareholder value, with capacity under revolving credit facilities and commercial paper programs ensuring business continuity and liquidity to fund operations, strategic investments and debt maturities. Ongoing self-insurance programs and excess coverage limits cap exposures to workers’ compensation, liability and medical claims, while impairment testing of long-lived assets and credit agreement compliance underscore the use of performance assessments, scenario projections and covenant monitoring to mitigate risks and preserve system integrity. The application of non-GAAP measures such as adjusted diluted earnings per share and return on invested capital further evidences management’s systemic perspective on resource deployment and financial resilience in maintaining performance under challenging conditions.

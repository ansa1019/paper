Goldman Sachs maintains a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework, overseen by its board and senior committees, that integrates capital planning, balance-sheet and liquidity planning, business continuity and operational resilience, model risk, cybersecurity and compliance disciplines to preserve critical functions and support recovery under stressed conditions.  The firm conducts regular stress tests and scenario analyses—covering market, credit, liquidity and operational shocks—to pre-fund potential 30-day and longer-term cash and collateral needs, holds an unencumbered pool of high-quality liquid assets, implements a contingency funding plan and staggers debt maturities to mitigate refinancing risk, and reviews capital adequacy through CCAR/DFAST and resolution capital models to ensure sufficient buffers above regulatory minimums.  Business continuity planning and resilience assurance programs require incident reporting, control self-assessments, third-party risk assessments and crisis management rehearsals to minimize disruption and maintain operational continuity, while technology and cybersecurity risk teams deploy preventive and detective controls, monitor vulnerabilities, perform penetration tests and oversee cloud security to safeguard data integrity, availability and confidentiality.  Independent second and third lines of defense—including compliance, conflicts resolution and internal audit—validate policies, limits, controls and training to manage legal, reputational and conduct risks, ensuring that the firm can adapt, absorb strain and sustain performance even in extreme or exceptional conditions.

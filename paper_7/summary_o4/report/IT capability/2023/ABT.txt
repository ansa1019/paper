Over the period from 2020 through 2023, Abbott’s diversified health care businesses demonstrated organizational resilience by mobilizing its teams across multiple fronts to develop and launch multiple types of new diagnostic tests to detect COVID-19 pursuant to emergency use authorizations in the U.S. and CE marks in other countries, adapting to volatile demand as case numbers fluctuated and, despite availability issues and inflationary pressures on raw materials, packaging materials and transportation costs, managing various supply chain challenges without significant supply disruption or shortage for services, raw materials and supplies and partially mitigating cost increases through price increases and gross margin improvement initiatives. In response to a voluntary recall and manufacturing stoppage at its Sturgis infant formula facility, the Company entered into a consent decree with the FDA to resume production and maintain operations, restarted partial production beginning with specialty formulas and ultimately Similac, and in 2022 mitigated the impact on U.S. supply by shipping formula from its facility in Ireland, prioritizing production at its Columbus, Ohio facility, converting liquid lines to manufacture Similac liquid ready-to-feed, increasing powder production in Casa Grande, Arizona, and importing product from Spain, actions that supported its recovery of market share in the fourth quarter of 2023. Abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation segments, despite procedure volume declines from surges, lockdowns and staffing challenges, saw overall volume trends improve in 2022 and growth continue in 2023; its branded generic pharmaceuticals business recovered volumes after pandemic impacts, and its nutritional and diabetes care segments remained least affected, reflecting the partial maintenance of integrity and performance under extreme and nominal disturbances. Strategic initiatives further bolstered organizational resilience, including the acquisition of Bigfoot Biomedical to advance connected diabetes management solutions and of Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. to complement vascular device offerings; sustained R&D spending targeted at approximately 7 percent of sales to drive innovation across pharmaceuticals, medical devices, diagnostics and nutritionals; quarterly and annual impairment assessments of goodwill and intangible assets; proactive management of rebates, uncertain tax positions, pension funding and litigation contingencies; and financial measures such as maintaining an investment-grade rating, $7.3 billion of cash and short-term investments, $5 billion in unused unsecured credit facilities, a balanced debt maturity profile, consistent operating cash flow exceeding capital expenditures and dividends, share repurchases, and dividend increases, enabling the Company to absorb strain, preserve functioning and sustain performance under internal and external variations and disturbances.

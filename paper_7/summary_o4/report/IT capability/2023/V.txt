During fiscal 2023 Visa faced volatility from U.S. bank failures and continuously monitored and managed balance sheet and operational risks from clients in its portfolio, including their settlement obligations, and maintained more than $10.1 billion of liquidity to fund daily settlement in the event of client non‐performance; in response to economic sanctions and the war in Ukraine during fiscal 2022, Visa suspended its operations in Russia, ceased generating revenue there and continues to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to its business; the company employs a $7.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and holds cash, cash equivalents and a debt securities portfolio designed to support working capital and strategic flexibility across nominal and extreme market conditions; global settlement risk policies and procedures, including collateral requirements for clients that do not meet credit standards and a U.S. retrospective responsibility plan funded through a litigation escrow account, are maintained to address litigation and settlement uncertainties; Visa’s systematic recognition of client incentive accruals, based on forecasts of payments and transaction volume, transactional data, market and economic conditions and client performance, illustrates its adaptability in measuring and managing performance under changing conditions; the use of non-GAAP financial measures provides transparency into management’s assessment of its ongoing operating performance; strategic initiatives such as the pending acquisition of Pismo Holdings, the authorization of a new $25 billion share repurchase program and a quarterly dividend of $0.52 per share demonstrate resource allocation and future orientation designed to preserve financial strength and operational continuity amid external pressures and regulatory variations.

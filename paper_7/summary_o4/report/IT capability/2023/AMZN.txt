The Company’s forward-looking statements caution that actual results may differ materially due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand, inflation, interest rates, regional labor constraints, world events, supply-chain disruptions, and other external pressures, highlighting management’s ongoing risk assessment and strategic agility. In pursuing long-term, sustainable growth, the Company allocates resources to improve free cash flows by enhancing operating income and efficiently managing inventory, receivables, payables, and capital expenditures, including decisions to purchase or lease property and equipment, while making targeted investments in strategic initiatives focused on enhancing the customer experience and process efficiency. To maintain operational flexibility and resilience, the Company seeks to reduce variable costs per unit through direct sourcing, supplier discounts, and defect reduction; to leverage fixed costs by improving process efficiencies and preserving a lean culture; and to turn inventory rapidly while managing variability in turnover and accounts payable driven by product mix, supply-chain lead times, geographic expansion, and third-party fulfillment. The Company expects technology and infrastructure spending to increase as it adds computing, design, software, and hardware engineering capacity, with investments supporting cross-functional systems for AWS and retail operations—including development of satellite broadband networks and autonomous vehicles—thereby fortifying its systemic perspective and dynamic capabilities. Cash flow generation from operations, together with cash and marketable securities balances and access to debt and equity markets, is viewed as a primary source of liquidity for meeting operational needs, funding investments, and executing financing strategies for acquisitions, refinancings, and share repurchases, while recognizing that projections remain subject to substantial uncertainty. Macroeconomic factors such as inflation, interest rates, capital market and supply-chain volatility, and geopolitical developments are expected to continue impacting sales growth, operating costs, and the Company’s ability to forecast consumer spending and enterprise demand, underscoring its emphasis on adaptability and resilience strategies. Guidance for net sales growth and operating income incorporates anticipated foreign exchange impacts and operational adjustments, including lower depreciation expense from revised useful lives, assuming no additional material acquisitions or legal settlements, reflecting the Company’s planning under varying scenarios to preserve system integrity and maintain performance under challenging conditions.

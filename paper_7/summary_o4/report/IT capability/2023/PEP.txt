In response to global adversity – including supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, shifting consumer behaviors, climate issues and geopolitical volatility such as the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East – the company has adopted pep+ as an end-to-end business transformation with sustainability at its center, leveraging regenerative agriculture, digital innovation and service evolution to reconfigure its value chain and improve resource deployment and continuity under pressure. To foresee, confront and derive benefit from unexpected disruptions, PepsiCo employs an integrated risk management framework in which the board and its committees oversee the identification, assessment, prioritization and mitigation of top strategic, financial, operational, compliance, safety and reputational risks, supported by a cross-functional Pepsico Risk Committee, division-level and country-level risk forums, and a risk management office. The company maintains organizational flexibility and preserves performance through productivity initiatives, global purchasing agreements, hedging of commodity, foreign exchange and interest-rate risks, and a multi-year productivity plan to simplify processes, harmonize systems and optimize its manufacturing and supply chain footprint. By continuously monitoring macroeconomic and industry trends, adapting its retail and e-commerce models, forging inter-organizational collaborations and securing adequate liquidity, PepsiCo seeks to absorb strain, maintain integrity and emerge stronger from extreme or exceptional conditions.

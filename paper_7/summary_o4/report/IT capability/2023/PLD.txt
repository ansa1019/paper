While uncertainties remain in the economic and geopolitical environment, management states that “our 2023 results are representative of the prospects we see for our business” and “we believe we are well positioned to organically grow revenues over the long-term,” reflecting an ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under challenging conditions. The company maintains significant liquidity—“total available liquidity of $6.0 billion, including borrowing capacity on our credit facilities of $5.5 billion and unrestricted cash balances of $530 million”—and has extended and restated its global and regional credit facilities (increasing borrowing capacity to $3.0 billion and extending maturities to 2027), demonstrating resource allocation, operational flexibility and preparedness for future funding needs. Risk mitigation practices include naturally hedging foreign currency exposure by borrowing in local currencies, using derivative financial instruments to manage currency and interest rate risk, and remaining in compliance with all financial debt covenants, thereby preserving system integrity and business continuity. Capital deployment is diversified across acquisitions, developments, co-investment ventures and strategic capital initiatives, with primary funding sources identified as “net cash flow from property operations … fees earned for services … distributions from co-investment ventures … borrowing capacity … and proceeds from the issuance of debt,” illustrating resource generation, adaptability and resilience strategies. The formation of unconsolidated co-investment ventures in Europe, Japan, Mexico and China and the allocation of property management and leasing costs across segments reflect inter-organizational collaboration, knowledge sharing and strategic initiatives to sustain performance under external pressures. Prudent dividend policies aligned with REIT distribution requirements further support continuity, while long-term debt issuances with a nine-year weighted average maturity underpin the firm’s capacity to anticipate, confront and adapt to disruptions in a turbulent business environment.

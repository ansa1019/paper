We make assumptions, judgments and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, recognizing that actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates on a regular basis; we continuously monitor the direct and indirect impacts of evolving macroeconomic conditions—including inflationary pressures, interest rate increases, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, potential economic slowdowns and geopolitical pressures—on our business and financial results, and mitigate currency risks in part through our foreign currency hedging program; to ensure business continuity and sufficient resource allocation, we maintain diversified sources of liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments managed by professional investment management firms, a $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement, a senior unsecured term loan agreement, a $3 billion commercial paper program and $3.65 billion of senior notes, and believe these, together with anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital, operating resource expenditure and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future; we regularly assess our working capital uses and sources—such as increases in prepaid expenses, deferred revenue recognized ratably over subscription periods, maturities and sales of short-term investments, ongoing capital expenditures, repayments of debt and structured stock repurchase agreements—to preserve operational flexibility and adapt to unexpected conditions; we execute long-term supplier commitments, lease arrangements for facilities and data centers and contractual indemnifications to uphold operational integrity and manage potential exposures; and we continue to focus on long-term opportunities available in our end markets and make significant investments in research and development, subscription and service offerings, apps and tools to maintain performance, foster innovation and adapt to customer needs amid an increasingly digital and turbulent environment.

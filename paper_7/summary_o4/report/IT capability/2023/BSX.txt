In its discussion of financial condition and operations, management describes a series of strategic, operational and financial measures that collectively reflect the company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite internal and external pressures.  Early in 2022 the company reorganized its operational structure by aggregating core businesses into two reportable segments, thereby simplifying reporting and aligning resources to better support business continuity and customer needs.  In February 2023 the board approved a new global restructuring plan to advance its global supply‐chain optimization strategy by transferring certain production lines among facilities, simplifying the manufacturing and distribution network, optimizing functional capabilities and driving operational efficiencies and resiliency; these activities, expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2025, are forecast to reduce gross annual pre-tax expenses by approximately $225 million to $275 million and generate $350 million to $450 million of cash outlays, with a substantial portion of resulting savings to be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives.  The company continues to manage global supply chain disruptions—mitigating raw-material shortages, inflationary cost pressures, labor and freight constraints—through rigorous inventory provisioning based on forecasted net sales, supplier and counterparty diversification and hedging foreign‐currency exposures.  On March 1, 2023, the company amended its $2.75 billion revolving credit facility—extending the maturity to May 10, 2027, adopting SOFR and revising financial covenants to permit exclusions for restructuring and litigation charges—to support operational flexibility, and maintains a commercial paper program and disciplined cash‐management practices (“invest excess cash on hand in short-term financial instruments that earn at market interest rates while mitigating principal risk through instrument and counterparty diversification”), bolstered by projected cash generation sufficient to fund operations, debt service, acquisitions and contingencies over the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future.  The use of non-GAAP financial measures—excluding amortization, impairment, acquisition- and restructuring-related charges, litigation credits, EU MDR implementation costs and other nonrecurring items—illustrates a systemic perspective and forward orientation in assessing core performance and resource allocation.  Sustainability and ESG commitments, including a “C3” strategy to cut energy use, convert to renewable sources and compensate with carbon offsets, ISO 50001 and ISO 14001 certifications at key sites and LEED-certified facilities, and a goal of carbon neutrality for Scope 1 and 2 emissions in manufacturing and distribution by 2030, demonstrate resilience engineering in response to environmental perturbations.  Finally, robust internal control over financial reporting, critical accounting estimates for revenue recognition, inventory provisions, valuation of intangible assets, contingent consideration and litigation accruals, and governance measures such as targeted trading policies and 10b5-1 plans reinforce the integrity, adaptability and continuity of organizational processes under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

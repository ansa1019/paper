Gilead continues to invest in its business and research and development pipeline through acquisitions and collaborations while providing shareholder returns, reflecting strategic resource allocation and the ability to maintain performance under changing conditions. Management regularly evaluates liquidity and capital resources—including cash, cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and access to external capital through revolving credit facilities—to ensure adequate financing of operations and to meet both short- and long-term obligations without material impact, thereby preserving business continuity and operational flexibility. The company employs foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a portion of its currency exposures, mitigating volatility and protecting product sales under external perturbations. In managing research and development expenses, Gilead identifies and prioritizes activities based on scientific data, probability of technical and regulatory success, market potential and available human and capital resources, and reallocates resources among internal and external opportunities to support long-term growth, demonstrating adaptability and dynamic capability. Risk assessment and mitigation are further evident in the recording of litigation and tax contingencies based on probability-weighted outcomes, with periodic reassessment of legal and tax positions, underscoring resilience to regulatory and legal uncertainties. Gilead’s process for estimating gross-to-net deductions, which requires judgment around contractual and statutory discounts, rebates, chargebacks and payer mix, enables maintenance of performance under both nominal and exceptional conditions by preserving expected revenues. Finally, the belief that existing capital resources supplemented by operating cash flows will satisfy foreseeable capital needs reflects strategic foresight and proactive planning to preserve organizational strength and continuity.

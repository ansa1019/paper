Since 2020, the company has demonstrated its ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions by scaling and evolving its molecular diagnostics, plastic consumables, biosciences, bioproduction and clinical research operations to support global COVID-19 testing and vaccine manufacturing, expanding capacity and reconfiguring service offerings to meet surges in demand and then partially offsetting the subsequent decline in pandemic-related revenue in 2023 through strong commercial execution under its “trusted partner” status, high-impact innovation and an unparalleled commercial engine. In response to lower COVID-19 volumes, the company implemented continuous productivity improvements via its Practical Process Improvement business system, global sourcing initiatives, headcount reductions and facility consolidations, incurring $0.2 billion of restructuring charges in 2023 that are expected to yield approximately $0.5 billion in annual cost savings to streamline operations and mitigate revenue pressure. Strategic growth investments have targeted enhancements in commercial capabilities, geographic sales reach, e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, service and operational infrastructure, research and development projects and employee incentives to sustain performance amid a challenging macroeconomic environment and low economic activity in certain regions. The acquisitions of the Binding Site Group and Corevitas, LLC have broadened the company’s portfolios with pioneering innovation in diagnostics and real-world evidence solutions, improving decision-making, resource allocation and time-to-market for drug development. Management’s use of organic revenue growth metrics, adjusted operating income measures and free cash flow forecasts informs its liquidity and capital deployment strategy—bolstered by a revolving credit facility, share repurchases and dividends—to ensure the firm’s operational flexibility, risk mitigation and system integrity under both nominal and exceptional disturbances.

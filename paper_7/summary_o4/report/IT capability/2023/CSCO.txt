In fiscal 2023, we delivered strong results with growth in revenue and profitability and remained focused on delivering innovation across our technologies to assist our customers in executing on their digital transformations; in past periods, we took multiple actions in order to mitigate component shortages and address supply constraints seen industry-wide, and during fiscal 2023 we saw an overall improvement of supply constraints and, as a result, we were able to increase the delivery of products to our customers, which positively impacted product revenue, and further continued to make progress in the transition of our business model delivering increased software and subscriptions.  While the overall environment remains uncertain and highly competitive, we continue to aggressively invest in priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term, and we believe that we have made continued progress on our strategic priorities.  The mitigating actions we took included partnering with several of our key suppliers utilizing our volume purchasing ability and extending supply coverage, including, in certain cases, revising supplier arrangements; paying and committing to pay in the future significantly higher costs for certain components; modifying our product designs in order to leverage alternate suppliers, where possible; and continually optimizing our inventory build and customer delivery plans, among others.  These mitigating actions have resulted in increased inventory balances, inventory purchase commitments, and inventory deposits and prepayments compared to prior fiscal years, which, in turn, has increased our supply chain exposure and could result in negative impacts to our product gross margin in future periods, including material excess and obsolete charges, if product demand significantly decreases for a sustained duration or we are unable to continue to mitigate the remaining supply chain exposures; we believe these mitigating actions have helped us to optimize our access to critical components and meet customer demand for our products as a result of the component shortages and significant supply constraints we saw in past periods.  We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments, manage our financing receivables and guarantees with third parties to mitigate credit risk, and maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities that we classify as short-term based on availability for use in current operations, believing the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong.  Our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends.  We target to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to our stockholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock, and we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment, acknowledging that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including shipment linearity, accounts receivable collections, inventory and supply chain management, deferred revenue and timing of tax and other payments.  In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in goodwill or intangible asset impairments; we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist.  Our contractual obligations, including long-term purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, operating leases, senior notes, and other purchase obligations, are managed through our annual budgeting process, and we believe that our cash and investments, together with cash generated from operations and access to capital markets and committed credit lines, will satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months.

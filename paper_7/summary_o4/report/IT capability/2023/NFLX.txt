In its discussion and analysis, management describes a series of operational and financial initiatives that reflect the maintenance of performance under challenging conditions, including the April 2023 decision to discontinue its DVD-by-mail service—which was executed with immaterial impact on operations—and the ongoing testing of plan and price variations to respond to evolving customer needs and market dynamics. The company has built and deployed its own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) to efficiently stream high volumes of content, demonstrating systemic adaptability and resource reconfiguration to ensure service continuity. During 2023, operating income rose 23 percent and operating margin expanded three percentage points as revenues grew faster than cost of revenues and marketing while technology and development expenses decreased, underscoring Netflix’s capacity to preserve and improve functioning despite external pressures. Management anticipates that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to its $1 billion revolving credit facility will remain sufficient to meet cash requirements for the next twelve months and beyond, illustrating proactive liquidity management and risk mitigation. Significant investments in original content, which require upfront cash outlays relative to licensed content, and the management of approximately $21.7 billion in content obligations under non-cancellable talent and licensing agreements further exemplify strategic resource deployment and risk assessment. The company generated $6.9 billion of free cash flow—defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures—enabling debt repayment, strategic acquisitions, investments and stock repurchases, thereby sustaining organizational strength. In its critical accounting policies, management applies historical experience and considerable judgment to amortize content assets on an accelerated basis over each title’s contractual window or estimated period of use and regularly reviews these estimates, reflecting adaptive learning processes and the maintenance of system integrity. Similarly, its capital structure strategy, which includes $14.5 billion of short-term and long-term debt, $8.4 billion of remaining share repurchase capacity and careful management of foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses, evidences strategic agility, financial resilience and the ability to preserve performance under pressure.

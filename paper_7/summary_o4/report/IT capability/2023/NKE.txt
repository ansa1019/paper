During fiscal 2023, Nike continued to invest in an enterprise resource planning platform, data and analytics, demand sensing and insight gathering to build an end-to-end technology foundation intended to accelerate digital transformation, unlock efficiency and enhance speed and responsiveness in serving consumers globally. The company navigated supply chain volatility and inflationary pressures by taking actions to reduce excess inventory—decreasing future purchases and increasing promotional activity—and by stabilizing inventory transit times, which resulted in the normalization of the seasonal flow of product in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. It managed temporary store closures and reduced retail traffic in Greater China due to COVID-19 restrictions and realized improved physical retail traffic following the lifting of mandated restrictions. To mitigate the risk of foreign currency fluctuations on product costs, external sales and translated financial results, Nike employs a centrally managed foreign exchange risk program that leverages natural offsets, correlation benefits and derivative instruments, including forward contracts and options, and further minimizes translational risk by using excess subsidiary cash to acquire U.S. dollar-denominated available-for-sale investments hedged for variability on purchase and sale. Liquidity is supported by cash, equivalents and short-term investments, access to committed credit facilities and a commercial paper program, which the company believes will be sufficient to meet its capital needs in the foreseeable future while it executes the consumer direct acceleration strategy—focused on creating premium, consistent and seamless consumer experiences through digital platforms, owned retail and select wholesale partners—to deliver long-term revenue growth and build a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories.

In our Management’s Discussion, we describe our historical success in adapting the business to changing economic and competitive conditions through adjustments to pricing and merchandise mix, increased penetration of private-label items and expanded online offerings, as well as through operational strategies to manage cost increases—working with suppliers to share cost escalations, early-and-bulk purchasing, selective price reductions to drive traffic, and holding prices steady to absorb inflationary pressures—while maintaining what we believe is our “pricing authority.” We also outline our approach to mitigating external risks and ensuring business continuity, including the use of bank credit and commercial letter-of-credit facilities, self-insurance and a captive insurance subsidiary with reinsurance coverage, forward deployment of inventory to accelerate delivery times under supply-chain constraints, flexible management of purchase and construction obligations, and funding capital expenditures for new and remodeled warehouses, information systems and distribution facilities with operating cash flows, cash and short-term investments. We note that expanding our warehouse base and membership format contribute to long-term resilience by providing recurring fee revenue, and that our gasoline business, despite lower margins, enhances warehouse traffic and helps smooth sales volatility. Government actions such as tariffs, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and gasoline prices, inflation or deflation and vigorous competition are recognized as external pressures that we cannot control but have historically mitigated through pricing, mix and operational adjustments. We acknowledge that our operations on very low margins make modest changes in merchandise costs, foreign-exchange rates, gasoline prices or tariffs capable of substantially impacting net income, and we believe that our liquidity position, with available credit under existing agreements, is sufficient to meet foreseeable capital and working-capital requirements. We maintain that our U.S. and international asset positions are adequate for our liquidity needs, and we plan to continue opening new warehouses—subject to potential changes in the economic environment—while managing cost structures, maintaining compensation levels above industry averages to reduce employee turnover and enhance organizational health, and monitoring various risk exposures in our inventory, operations and financial obligations to preserve performance under challenging conditions.

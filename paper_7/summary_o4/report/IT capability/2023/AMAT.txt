Each of our segments is subject to variable industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips, display technologies and other electronic devices, as well as global economic, political and market conditions and the nature and timing of technological advances, requiring operational flexibility and adaptability. We experienced supply chain and logistics constraints in fiscal 2022, and although there have been significant improvements in supply chain performance in fiscal 2023, we expect some shortages to persist and managing these supply chain constraints to increase shipments to customers remains a top priority. Our strategic priorities—including developing products that help solve customers’ challenges at technology inflections, expanding our served market opportunities and growing our services business—reflect a systemic perspective and future orientation designed to sustain performance under pressure. Our long-term growth strategy requires continued development of new materials engineering capabilities and significant investments in research, development and engineering to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand, thus enabling early-stage technology selection by customers and reinforcing our competitive advantage. We work closely with our global customers to design systems and processes that meet their planned technical and production requirements, demonstrating inter-organizational collaboration and strategic response to disruptive change. Management believes that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability under committed revolving credit agreements, commercial paper programs and credit facilities, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months, illustrating our commitment to risk mitigation and financial resource management. We regularly monitor the credit risk in our investment portfolio and take appropriate measures to manage such risks prudently in accordance with our investment policies. We may seek to refinance our existing debt and may incur additional indebtedness depending on our capital requirements and the availability of financing, thereby maintaining operational continuity and resilience in our capital structure. In response to evolving regulatory pressures—including additional export regulations, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act capitalization of R&D, the CHIPS and Science Act investment tax credit and the Inflation Reduction Act’s corporate minimum and excise taxes—we evaluate and recognize the effects on our deferred tax assets, effective tax rates and cash tax liabilities, adapting our tax planning to preserve organizational integrity and performance.

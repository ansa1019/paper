We continue to ramp production, build new manufacturing capacity and expand our operations to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products, invest in research and development to accelerate our AI, software and fleet-based profits for further revenue growth and vertically integrate and localize our supply chain while improving vehicle performance, decreasing production costs and increasing affordability. We are focused on increasing vehicle production, capacity and delivery capabilities, improving and deploying our FSD capabilities, expanding global service and charging infrastructure and ramping energy storage and solar product deployments, recognizing uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations—which may be exacerbated by new product and manufacturing technologies, multiple concurrent international projects, industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages and events outside our control—and responding to a cyclical industry sensitive to political and regulatory uncertainty, inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, interest rate fluctuations, trade conditions and competitor actions. We will continue to adjust our cost reduction efforts, localized procurement and manufacturing, production innovation and efficiencies at our newest factories and lower logistics costs to maintain our momentum and operating leverage, even as we experience pre-planned shutdowns for factory upgrades. As our production increases, we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so it does not become a bottleneck, and as other manufacturers adopt the North American Charging Standard, we must correspondingly expand our Supercharger network to ensure adequate availability. In our energy business, we remain committed to growing retrofit solar and Megapack deployments by improving installation capabilities, price efficiencies and ensuring adequate battery cell supply and qualified personnel. Our capital expenditures remain difficult to project beyond the short term due to the breadth of global projects, ramping new products and facilities, piloting battery cell technologies, expanding our Supercharger network and investing in autonomy and AI-enabled products, and may vary based on project priorities, milestone pacing, production adjustments, capital efficiencies and inflationary and supply chain variables. Our business has consistently generated cash flow from operations in excess of capital spend, with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding; accordingly, we expect to continue to self-fund growth, adjust capital and operating expenditures by operating segment, slow the pace of capital expenditures if manufacturing ramps more slowly than expected and utilize or raise financing—drawing on $16.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $12.7 billion in short-term investments and $5.03 billion of unused credit commitments—to preserve liquidity, mitigate risks and maintain performance under internal and external variations and disturbances.

Schwab’s annual report describes a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework that integrates risk identification and assessment, risk response, risk measurement and monitoring, and risk reporting and escalation under board‐ and management‐level oversight.  The firm has established an integrated risk governance structure—comprising the board risk committee, audit committee and functional risk subcommittees—and a global risk committee charged with identifying emerging risks, reinforcing accountability for operational and compliance controls, and escalating material issues.  Operational risk arising from process, people, system failures or external events—including natural disasters, cyber attacks, linkages with third‐party systems, extreme weather and power failures—is managed through policies, a system of internal controls, insurance programs and a well‐established incident management program; the firm maintains backup and recovery infrastructure, geographically dispersed operations, routine business continuity and disaster recovery testing, and ongoing monitoring to ensure continuity of critical functions under stress.  Third‐party risk is governed by contractual standards, control requirements, performance monitoring and testing, and fraud risk is mitigated through policy, surveillance and training.  Model risk is addressed via a formal governance policy with risk‐based model assessments, independent validations and performance monitoring.  Compliance, anti‐money laundering and fiduciary risks are overseen by dedicated committees and programs designed to monitor employee conduct, client suitability, conflicts of interest and regulatory obligations.  Schwab manages market risk and liquidity risk through net interest revenue and economic value of equity simulations, liquidity stress testing, contingency funding plans, early‐warning indicators, and maintenance of high‐quality liquid assets to preserve system integrity and performance under varying rate environments and cash‐flow stresses.  Capital resilience is supported by semi‐annual and annual stress tests, a formal capital contingency plan for low‐probability/high‐impact scenarios, maintenance of regulatory capital ratios, and disciplined dividend and share repurchase policies.  The phased integration of TD Ameritrade is managed through staged client transitions, monitoring of client asset attrition, tracking of acquisition and integration costs, and operational restructuring—including position eliminations and real estate rationalization—to maintain continuity and strengthen the firm’s operational and strategic capabilities in a complex, evolving business environment.

TI’s strategy to maximize long-term free cash flow per share growth rests on four sustainable competitive advantages—a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology providing lower costs and greater control of the supply chain; a broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products offering more opportunity per customer and greater value for investments; the reach of market channels that gives access to more customers and better insight and knowledge of customer needs; and the diversity and longevity of products, markets and customer positions that provide less single-point dependency and longer returns on investments—together helping the company absorb strain from volatile customer demand and maintain performance under changing conditions. The company makes its investments with an eye towards long-term strengthening and leveraging of these advantages, demonstrates discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities spanning R&D projects, new manufacturing capacity, digital capabilities and shareholder returns, and emphasizes efficiency by constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent. Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed. When factory loadings decrease, our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins decrease; conversely, as factory loadings increase, our fixed costs are spread over increased output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins increase, reflecting operational flexibility to absorb demand variability. Cash flow from operations remained the primary source of liquidity, supplemented by cash, short-term investments and an undrawn revolving credit facility, enabling the company to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividends and debt obligations for at least the next 12 months. During 2023, the company continued to strategically build inventory, invested $5.07 billion in capital expenditures primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and facilities, and invested $3.69 billion in R&D and SG&A to strengthen competitive advantages, reflecting preparedness for future market disruptions. The expectation to receive the cash benefit associated with the investment tax credit under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act and the submission of applications for manufacturing grants illustrate strategic foresight and resource reconfiguration. The inclusion of free cash flow and related ratios as non-GAAP measures provides insight into liquidity, cash-generating capability and resilience, while the application of judgment and estimates in income taxes and inventory valuation allowances, including statistical allowances for raw materials, work in process and finished goods, demonstrates risk assessment, mitigation and adaptive decision making in financial reporting.

During fiscal 2023 the Company responded to a sharply deteriorated memory and storage market by recognizing $1.83 billion of inventory write-downs to net realizable value and $382 million of facility underutilization charges, reducing capital expenditures and wafer starts significantly below peak capacity levels to manage inventories and control supply, and initiating a 2023 restructuring plan expected to yield approximately $130 million of quarterly cost savings across cost of goods sold, R&D, and SG&A following headcount reductions of up to 15 percent through voluntary attrition and personnel actions. The Company also implemented productivity programs, suspended its 2023 bonus, reduced external spending, curtailed select product programs, and lowered discretionary and executive compensation to preserve operating flexibility. In response to the China CAC cybersecurity review, it continues to work to mitigate uncertain revenue impacts and quarter-to-quarter variability with the long-term objective of retaining global DRAM and NAND market share. The updated portfolio strategy announced in 2021 ceased 3D XPoint development, classified related assets held for sale, and realized a $435 million impairment charge with associated tax benefits, reflecting strategic reconfiguration of investment focus. To support future demand, the Company continuously evaluates funding alternatives, maintains high-quality cash and marketable investment portfolios with $10.44 billion in cash and investments, preserves a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, and expects cash flows and available financing to satisfy requirements through at least the next twelve months. It plans over $7 billion of 2024 capital expenditures, contingent on partner contributions and government incentives, and has commenced construction of two CHIPS Act-subsidized DRAM fabs in Boise, Idaho and Clay, New York, as well as expansions of its global back-end assembly and test network in Xi’an, China and Gujarat, India. The Board’s ongoing review of share repurchase authorizations of up to $10 billion and quarterly dividend declarations further illustrate its strategic allocation of financial resources. Cash flows from operations, investing, and financing activities were adjusted for non-cash items including depreciation, amortization, write-downs, asset impairments, and stock-based compensation, and the Company’s continuous inventory lower-of-cost-or-net-realizable-value assessments, goodwill impairment testing, and contingent liability evaluations demonstrate its governance processes to preserve system integrity and maintain performance under adverse conditions.

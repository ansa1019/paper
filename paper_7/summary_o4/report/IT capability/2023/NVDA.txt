In response to surging demand and evolving market conditions, the company has enhanced the resiliency and redundancy of its supply chain by increasing supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, integrating new vendors, and entering into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to buffer against lead-time variability and component shortages. The company maintains finished goods inventory in advance of anticipated demand, continuously manages product availability and costs with vendors, and adjusts long-term supply and capacity commitments based on demand visibility across multiple product transitions. Although shipping new and prior architecture products in parallel poses complexity and execution risk, such practices enable operational flexibility and risk mitigation in manufacturing lead times, quality, and demand forecasting. The company monitors macroeconomic factors—including inflation, interest rates, capital market volatility and global trade regulations—and adapts its product portfolio by offering alternative solutions where export controls apply, thereby preserving market access and business continuity. Financial resilience is supported through substantial cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, a diversified investment policy with maturity limits, and continuous evaluation of liquidity and capital resources to fund operating requirements, capital investments, debt maturities and shareholder return programs. Through these supply chain redundancy measures, inventory provisioning, demand-driven capacity planning, risk assessment processes and adaptive product management strategies, the company seeks to absorb external and internal variations, preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions and maintain performance despite the presence of adversity.

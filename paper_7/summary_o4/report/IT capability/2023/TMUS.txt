Management’s efforts to preserve functioning under adversity have included extensive integration and decommissioning initiatives to rationalize our network infrastructure—accelerating or terminating certain operating and financing leases for cell sites, switch sites and network equipment—and the retirement of legacy Sprint CDMA and LTE networks, accompanied by impairment assessments of wireline assets. Upon closing the merger, we implemented restructuring initiatives to realize cost efficiencies from contract terminations, severance of redundant processes and functions, and decommissioning of small cell sites and distributed antenna systems, with the remaining restructuring and integration costs expected to be incurred by the first half of 2024 and cash expenditures extending beyond. To maintain operational continuity and absorb external pressures, we continue to monitor macroeconomic trends, including potential recessionary impacts, changes in monetary policy and geopolitical risks, and have established diversified liquidity sources—cash generated from operations, a $7.5 billion revolving credit facility, an unsecured $2 billion commercial paper program, securitization of receivables and up to $8.7 billion of financing leases—thereby ensuring funding for capital expenditures, spectrum license acquisitions, network modernization and other strategic initiatives. Our capital allocation has been driven by spectrum license purchases—$9.3 billion in C-band and $304 million in 2.5 GHz auctions—and network expansion, with anticipated reduced capital intensity in 2024. We have entered into license purchase agreements in the 600 MHz band for $3.5 billion and with Comcast for $1.2–$3.3 billion, subject to FCC approval, and plan to acquire Kaʻena Corporation for up to $1.35 billion to enhance wholesale partnerships. We regularly review and update projections for financial and operating performance, competitive dynamics and risk exposures, maintain compliance with debt covenants and manage contractual obligations and purchase commitments so as to adapt to environmental perturbations, reconfigure resource deployment and sustain performance under varying and extreme conditions.

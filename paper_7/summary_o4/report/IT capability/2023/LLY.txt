Management’s discussion and analysis outlines the Company’s recognition of various risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from forward‐looking statements and describes proactive measures to maintain operational continuity, including managing research and development spending across its pipeline so that a delay or termination of any one project will not materially change total research and development expenditure, and continuously evaluating liquidity and capital resources—comprising available cash, operating cash flow generation, and access to borrowings—to ensure sufficient funding of existing and planned capital requirements. It details responses to significant demand pressures for incretin products, noting intermittent supply delays, implementation of demand‐management measures to minimize patient impact, development of alternative delivery presentations, and the ongoing expansion of internal and contracted manufacturing capacity at multiple sites to address tight supplies. The discussion further explains the Company’s risk management program, which employs derivative financial instruments to limit the impact of interest‐rate and foreign‐currency fluctuations, and its self‐insurance approach to mitigate liabilities in a restrictive insurance market, including assessment of policy coverage limits and insurer solvency. Business development activities are described as strategic initiatives to enhance the product pipeline through acquisitions, collaborations, and licensing arrangements, with judgments made on accounting for asset versus business combinations and related fair‐value and impairment assessments to preserve performance under uncertainty. The Company also describes its processes for reviewing long‐lived and indefinite‐lived assets for impairment based on projected undiscounted cash flows, establishing accruals for product returns, rebates, and discounts at the time of sale—incorporating historical trends, contract terms, and changes in sales patterns—and recognizing that subsequent revisions may affect net product revenue. Finally, the MD&A addresses the evaluation of litigation, environmental, and tax contingencies based on the merits of claims, technical tax interpretations, and changes in facts or regulations, with reserves adjusted accordingly to support the Company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite external pressures and adverse conditions.

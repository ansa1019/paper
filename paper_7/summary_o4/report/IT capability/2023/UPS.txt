Our management’s discussion and analysis describes how we continue to enhance customer engagement through combining our network with digital capabilities and to invest in the most attractive parts of the market, including healthcare, Asia trade lanes and small‐ and medium‐sized businesses, as well as our acquisitions of MNX Global Logistics and Happy Returns and the opening of a state‐of‐the‐art UPS Velocity Fulfillment Center and planned air hub in Hong Kong, to reach new markets and better serve our customer base while absorbing operational strain. Faced with challenging macroeconomic headwinds, including inflationary pressures, changes in consumer behavior and volume diversion arising from labor negotiations, we remain focused on executing a customer‐first, people‐led and innovation‐driven strategy by taking action to right‐size our business for the future, exploring strategic alternatives for our truckload brokerage business and reducing headcount through our “Fit to Serve” initiative to create a more efficient operating model and enhance responsiveness to changing market dynamics. We have implemented ongoing productivity initiatives, reductions in purchased transportation, strategic rate and surcharge actions and fuel surcharges indexed to Department of Energy spot prices, enabling us to maintain industry‐leading service levels despite cost pressures and volume declines. Despite the suspension and liquidation of operations in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, we reported these actions as having no material impact on our consolidated results, reflecting our ability to preserve operational continuity under external disturbances. Our disciplined and balanced capital allocation approach, including maintaining $6.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, accessing commercial paper and capital markets, issuing and refinancing debt and planning pension contributions, supports business continuity, mitigates liquidity risk and funds ongoing investments in network enhancement, technology initiatives and environmental sustainability, thereby underlining our capacity to adapt and preserve functioning despite internal or external disturbances.

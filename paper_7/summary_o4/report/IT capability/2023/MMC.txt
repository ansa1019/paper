The company emphasizes its capacity to adapt and maintain performance under varying external pressures, citing collaborative risk management activities—risk advice, risk transfer and risk control and mitigation solutions—across its market‐leading businesses and the strategic reallocation of resources through investments in talent and capabilities to support business continuity and growth. It describes operational flexibility in response to macroeconomic and geopolitical disruptions, including multiple major wars and market volatility, and the formal isolation of foreign currency impacts to preserve comparability of results. The company undertook restructuring actions—workforce actions, technology rationalization and reductions in real estate—realizing estimated savings of $400 million to preserve organizational health, while refining detailed plans for each business and location to ensure agility and sustain functioning under adversity. Risk mitigation is further evidenced by insurance and indemnity recoveries related to legacy errors and omissions, contingent commissions arrangements, and maintenance of segregated fiduciary funds. Strategic resource deployment appears in acquisitions and dispositions designed to reinforce competitive advantage, support continuity in new business and renewals, and diversify revenue streams, while share repurchase programs, senior debt issuances, liquidity management via revolving credit and commercial paper facilities and dividend policies underscore the preservation of financial resilience and the ability to absorb strain. In financial risk management, the company maintains defined benefit plans with funding policies aligned to legal requirements, employs probabilistic models to set long-term return assumptions and discount rates for pension obligations and reevaluates deferred tax assets in light of sustained profitability. The firm’s use of net investment hedges against currency risks, continuous monitoring of liquidity and capital resources, and quarterly reassessment of contingent loss reserves and purchase price allocations illustrate a systemic perspective on hazard mitigation and adaptation strategies. Finally, the annual goodwill impairment assessments and accounting policy estimates for legal contingencies, tax uncertainties and asset valuations reflect a forward-looking orientation and robust decision-making framework designed to maintain integrity and performance under both nominal and disruptive conditions.

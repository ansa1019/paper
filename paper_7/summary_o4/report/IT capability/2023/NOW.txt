ServiceNow’s management discussion highlights how the Now Platform unifies and digitizes workflows by connecting disparate departments, systems and silos in a seamless way to unlock productivity while increasing customers’ resiliency and security. The company monitors evolving geopolitical conflicts and macroeconomic pressures—such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Israel–Gaza conflict, rising interest rates, global inflation and bank failures—and, although it does not currently expect these events to have a material impact on its business, maintains ongoing risk mitigation and monitoring processes, including the distribution of cash and cash equivalents across multiple financial institutions, policy restrictions on its available-for-sale debt securities, hedging of foreign currency exposures with derivative contracts and the inclusion of data backup and disaster recovery services in its offerings. ServiceNow generates positive operating and free cash flows from subscription services paid in advance, reports $8.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2023, and believes these resources, together with anticipated cash flows, are sufficient to meet liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months. The company allocates capital expenditures to expand data centers and develop new services and core technologies, enters into non-cancelable purchase commitments and operating leases to support growth, sustains a 98% renewal rate on subscription arrangements, and executes a $1.5 billion share repurchase program to manage its capital structure and preserve or improve functioning under internal and external disturbances.

Management’s discussion and analysis discloses that the company’s management uses adjusted earnings for internal financial planning, performance analysis, board reporting and as an input to performance-based compensation, reflecting a systemic perspective and proactive resource allocation to maintain fundamental earnings power under challenging conditions. FPL secured regulatory approval to recover approximately $1.3 billion in storm restoration costs related to Hurricanes Ian and Nicole and implemented an interim storm restoration charge in April 2023, demonstrating operational flexibility and adaptation to extreme weather events. FPL also employs reserve amortization under its 2021 rate agreement to adjust accrued asset removal costs and achieve its targeted regulatory return, with resulting regulatory assets and liabilities reflecting changes in storm cost reserves and asset retirements. Both FPL and NEER continued significant investments in solar generation additions, ongoing transmission and distribution expansions, the Dania Beach clean energy center, and in 2023 NEER added 1,651 MW of new wind capacity and 2,073 MW of solar capacity while increasing its backlog of contracted renewable development projects, illustrating the reconfiguration of its operational trajectory toward future growth and resilience. NextEra segregates mark-to-market gains and losses into non-qualifying hedges and trading activities, acknowledging earnings volatility inherent in energy derivative positions and excluding non-qualifying hedge impacts from its adjusted results as a meaningful measure of stability under market perturbations. The company and its subsidiaries require diverse funding sources—including operating cash flows, short- and long-term debt, equity issuances, differential membership interests, tax-credit sales and asset sales—to support and grow their businesses while maintaining a strong investment-grade credit rating; at December 31, 2023, total net available liquidity was approximately $12.2 billion. Credit and market risks are managed through established policies, counterparty credit limits, collateral arrangements, master netting agreements and oversight by a dedicated committee, and derivative instruments are used to manage fuel, electricity, interest rate and foreign currency exposures, with value-at-risk models measuring potential losses. The company accrues asset retirement obligations for nuclear decommissioning and generation plant dismantlement based on actuarial estimates of future costs and records corresponding regulatory assets and liabilities to ensure continuity of system integrity. Liquidity and risk mitigation are further supported by syndicated and bilateral credit facilities aggregating $15.97 billion, standby letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantee arrangements in support of purchase agreements, project-level financing and trading obligations. Capital covenant provisions govern subordinated debt redemptions to preserve organizational capital structure, and defined benefit pension plan assumptions are reviewed annually to align pension income with expected asset returns and discount rates, underpinning long-term organizational health and resilience.

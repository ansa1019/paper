As part of our risk mitigation and business continuity efforts, we maintain a robust liquidity position—$65.40 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2023—concentrated with large financial institutions and invested in highly rated securities, and we anticipate sufficient capital to meet operational needs and fund share repurchases and dividends for at least the next twelve months. We regularly evaluate legal, regulatory and tax contingencies, accruing liabilities when losses are probable and estimable and adjusting provisions based on the merits of defenses, negotiations and evolving regulations to preserve organizational health and performance. In response to significant macroeconomic and geopolitical pressures, including inflation, rising interest rates, market uncertainty and jurisdictional access restrictions, we invest in AI-driven discovery engines and new ad formats such as Reels; develop privacy-enhancing technologies and data-sharing tools; and adjust headcount, consolidate facilities and substantially complete data center initiatives launched since 2022—incurring pre-tax restructuring charges to reconfigure resources and realign strategic priorities. To address changes in privacy laws and platform policies, we announced plans to shift the legal basis for behavioral advertising in Europe from “legitimate interests” to “consent,” introduced a subscription option for no ads and continue active engagement with regulators; we also evolve our advertising systems to improve ad delivery, targeting and measurement, leveraging generative AI and exploring industry-wide open standards for secure data processing. Supported by disciplined capital allocation—allocating eighty percent of costs to our Family of Apps segment for headcount, data centers and technical infrastructure and twenty percent to long-term, cutting-edge research and development in Reality Labs—we believe these measures strengthen our ability to absorb strain, adapt to environmental disruptions and preserve or improve our functioning under challenging conditions.

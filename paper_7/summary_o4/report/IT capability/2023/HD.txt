We generated $21.2 billion of cash flow from operations and issued $2.0 billion of long-term debt, using that cash, together with cash on hand, to fund $8.4 billion of dividends and $8.0 billion of share repurchases, while investing $3.2 billion in capital expenditures and $1.5 billion in acquisitions and repaying $1.3 billion of long-term debt, reflecting a disciplined capital allocation approach that prioritizes investing in the business and accelerating strategic initiatives to enhance capabilities and customer experience, followed by dividends and share repurchases, thereby deploying resources to support operations, mitigate risk, and preserve or improve functioning under adverse conditions; at January 28, 2024, we held $3.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, had no outstanding borrowings under our $5.0 billion commercial paper program and remained in compliance with all covenants, and maintained $42.2 billion of senior notes outstanding (with $1.1 billion maturing within 12 months), underpinning business continuity and liquidity; we had $14.6 billion of aggregate lease payment obligations, $2.5 billion of purchase obligations and $689 million of unrecognized tax benefits, and we believe our current cash position, cash flow generation, commercial paper capacity and access to long-term debt markets are sufficient not only for operating requirements and contractual obligations but also to enable investment in operations and strategic resilience; net cash provided by operating activities increased by $6.6 billion in fiscal 2023 primarily through working capital management—in particular, lower inventory purchases, timing of vendor payments and normalized inventory levels—demonstrating adaptability to environmental perturbations and supporting performance maintenance; we use non-GAAP measures such as return on invested capital (36.7% for fiscal 2023) to measure how effectively we deploy capital, and for fiscal 2024 we plan approximately $3.0 billion to $3.5 billion in capital expenditures focused on new stores, technology and other differentiated capabilities, with the ability to adjust in response to economic conditions to maintain operational flexibility, system integrity and organizational resilience.

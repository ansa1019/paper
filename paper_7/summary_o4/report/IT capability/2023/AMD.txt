During 2023, AMD demonstrated its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning in the face of a mixed demand environment by successfully launching multiple leadership products across data center, client, gaming and embedded segments, including fourth-generation EPYC processors, Instinct MI300 accelerators and Ryzen 7000 series offerings, while adjusting its product mix to mitigate weaker PC market conditions and inventory correction pressures. The Company advanced its artificial intelligence strategy by bringing together multiple AI teams, making strategic acquisitions of Mipsology and NOD to develop an open software ecosystem and extending collaborative engagements with hyperscaler customers to accelerate large-scale deployments, reflecting dynamic capabilities, resource reconfiguration and inter-organizational collaboration to respond effectively to technological disruptions. Management maintained operational flexibility and business continuity through active working capital management, including a $1.7 billion cash inflow from operations, a disciplined inventory build to support new process nodes, timing of supplier payments, and the maintenance of $5.8 billion in cash and equivalents along with $3 billion revolver and commercial paper facilities, illustrating risk mitigation, contingency planning and forward-looking liquidity management. Seasonal revenue variability and shifts in segment performance were addressed by reallocating resources to R&D—up 17% year-over-year—to support AI and cloud-native computing investments, while critical accounting estimates for revenue allowances, inventory valuation and goodwill impairment were continually assessed to maintain financial integrity under evolving macroeconomic, technological and regulatory pressures, including forthcoming global minimum tax legislation.

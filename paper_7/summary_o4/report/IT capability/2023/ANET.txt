Arista continues to evolve and adapt to its rapidly changing environment by making significant supply chain investments, including funding additional working capital and incremental purchase commitments in response to extended visibility to customer deployment plans, and by working closely with contract manufacturers and supply chain partners to ramp production following delayed component sourcing and workforce disruptions. This increased capacity has allowed the company to ship products against previously committed demand plans, balance customer lead times with supplier constraints and limit excess inventory even as lead times shorten and demand-planning horizons return to normal. Management actively monitors macroeconomic factors—such as inflation, monetary policy shifts, geopolitical conflicts and supply chain pressures—and evaluates their impact on financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers and workforce to preserve operational continuity under adverse or exceptional conditions. To maintain flexibility and competitive advantage, Arista’s development model engineers EOS software to be agnostic to underlying merchant silicon architecture, enabling rapid expansion of software applications, integration with third-party virtualization, automation and orchestration services, and focused allocation of research and development resources on core competencies. The company continues to invest in R&D to enhance platform functionality, introduce new products and features, expand its sales force and partner relationships worldwide, and rapidly develop market-leading applications to address evolving customer needs and unexpected disruptions. Arista believes its ability to reconfigure resources, deploy innovations swiftly and leverage a robust network of channel, technology and system-level partners is critical to preserving positive adjustment under challenging conditions. With $5.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held largely in highly rated instruments, together with cash generated from operations, the company expects to meet its working capital requirements and growth strategies for at least the next 12 months. The company also regularly evaluates inventory valuations, contract manufacturer and supplier liabilities, and material cash requirements—including purchase obligations, lease commitments and capital projects—to ensure resilience and preserve functioning despite internal or external variations and disturbances.

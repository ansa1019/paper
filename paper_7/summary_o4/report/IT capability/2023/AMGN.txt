Amgen acknowledges its exposure to uncertain macroeconomic conditions, including higher inflation, rising interest rates, instability in the financial system, increasing healthcare costs and ongoing geopolitical conflicts, and it continuously monitors and mitigates the potential effects of health-related events such as future COVID-19 variants on physician-patient interactions and clinical trial enrollment, while hedging foreign currency exposure to partially offset exchange-rate pressures on net income. The company maintains a strategic and disciplined approach to capital allocation, deploying cash flows from operations—$8.5 billion in 2023—to support investments in business expansion, acquisitions, research and development, debt reduction and returns to shareholders, and aligns human capital resource management, compensation, benefits and development programs to attract, develop and retain talent, promote accountability and foster a diverse, inclusive culture that supports innovation and patient service. Sustainability targets, including carbon neutrality by 2027, water consumption reduction and waste minimization, reflect a systemic perspective on environmental responsibility, while R&D investments and collaborative licensing bolster the organization’s dynamic capabilities to discover, develop and commercialize innovative therapies under regulatory and competitive pressures. A robust liquidity position, diversified financing arrangements, revolving credit and commercial paper facilities, hedging strategies and adherence to risk management practices aim to preserve operational continuity and financial flexibility. Amgen’s forward-looking statements acknowledge inherent risks, uncertainties and assumptions inherent in forecasting product sales, regulatory outcomes, clinical-development milestones and macroeconomic variables, reflecting an organizational commitment to continuous adjustment, resilience and performance maintenance amid evolving external disturbances and market volatility.

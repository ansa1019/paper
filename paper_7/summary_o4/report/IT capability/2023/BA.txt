Boeing reports that, while its principal operations are in the U.S., it conducts operations in an expanding number of countries and relies on an extensive network of non-U.S. partners, key suppliers and subcontractors, and it continues to monitor the health and stability of the supply chain despite production quality issues, global supply chain constraints, labor instability and inflationary pressures that have reduced overall productivity and adversely impacted its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The company states that airline financial performance “has benefited from the resilient demand for travel” even as the industry “remains vulnerable to exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics, pandemics and increased global environmental regulations.” Boeing “continually monitors the global trade environment in response to geopolitical economic developments, as well as changes in tariffs, trade agreements or sanctions that may impact the company” and is “mitigating import costs through duty drawback customs procedures,” “complying with all U.S. and other government export control restrictions and sanctions imposed on certain businesses and individuals in Russia,” and supporting its employees and customers amid conflicts in Israel and the Gaza Strip by “closely monitoring developments, supporting our employees and customers, and taking mitigating actions as appropriate.” In response to regulatory actions on its 737-9 aircraft plug incident, Boeing is “following the lead of the FAA as we work through the certification process of the 737-7 and 737-10 models,” performing “enhanced maintenance and inspection” on grounded fleets, incorporating engineering solutions that will delay certification and first deliveries, and acknowledging that it is “currently unable to reasonably estimate what impact the accident, the related FAA actions and certification delays will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.” To maintain operational continuity and financial flexibility, Boeing expects to “fund cash requirements through cash and short-term investments and cash provided by operations, as well as continued access to capital markets,” to “enter into revolving credit agreements” as back-up liquidity, and to work with third-party financiers to reduce its customer financing commitments, while warning that “a number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets.” Its strategy is “centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses—Commercial Airplanes, Defense, Space & Security and Global Services”—with BDS “integrat[ing] its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security, space and services to deliver capability-driven solutions,” BCA “committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, safety, quality, efficiency and value,” and BGS providing “innovative, comprehensive and cost-competitive product and service solutions,” all designed to absorb strain, preserve functionality under challenging conditions and position the company to capture long-term growth even amid supply chain disruptions, regulatory scrutiny, labor instability and environmental turbulence.

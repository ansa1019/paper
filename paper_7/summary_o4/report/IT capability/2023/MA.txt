Mastercard employs a multi‐layered approach to help protect the global payments ecosystem in which it operates, underpinned by its franchise model that balances value and risk across all stakeholders and enables interoperability, and it continues to invest in new networks—such as open banking solutions and digital identity capabilities—to support and strengthen its payments and services solutions and ensure operational continuity under internal and external variations and disturbances. To mitigate currency and settlement exposures, Mastercard may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts designated as cash‐flow hedges, guarantees the settlement of many customer transactions through its credit and settlement risk framework, and maintains an $8 billion revolving credit facility and commercial paper program to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes and business continuity. The company relies on existing liquidity, cash generated from operations and access to capital resources to fund its global operations, capital expenditures, investments and potential obligations—including litigation provisions and credit and settlement exposures—and believes these resources are sufficient to absorb strain and preserve functionality despite market pressures and geopolitical disruptions. In 2022 and 2023, Mastercard recorded charges related to imposed sanctions and the suspension of its business operations in Russia and adjusted its reported metrics to exclude sanctioned volumes, reflecting its capacity to reconfigure trajectories of response and adapt to unexpected conditions while maintaining performance.

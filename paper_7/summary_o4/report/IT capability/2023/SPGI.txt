The MD&A emphasizes the importance of maintaining operational flexibility and business continuity through active resource deployment, risk mitigation and strategic response to both internal and external pressures. Management’s forward-looking framework—“powering global markets”—underscores efforts to sustain performance under challenging conditions by enhancing foundational capabilities, pursuing cost and revenue synergies from the merger with IHS Markit, and executing disciplined capital allocation to meet organic revenue and EBITA margin targets. This includes strengthening data management and cybersecurity controls, “eliminating known risk areas vulnerable to threat actor exploitation,” and formulating an enterprise-wide AI strategy to accelerate innovation and drive productivity. The company’s liquidity and capital resources strategy—anchored by strong cash generation, available credit under a committed facility, and prudent use of proceeds for strategic acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends—aims to preserve or improve functioning despite market volatility. Management further commits to continuous risk management, compliance and control across the enterprise, while regulatory developments such as the EU’s Digital Operational Resilience Act, benchmark regulation and MiFID II have prompted governance enhancements, operational resilience investments and alignment with IOSCO principles. Together, these actions reflect S&P Global’s pursuit of adaptability, systemic integrity and partial maintenance of performance in the face of disruptions, thereby supporting its ability to absorb strain, reconfigure trajectories in response to events, and emerge stronger under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

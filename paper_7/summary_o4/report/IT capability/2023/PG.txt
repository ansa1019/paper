Management’s discussion underscores the company’s organizational resilience through “the ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements (including execution of supply chain optimizations and sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements) and to manage disruption of business due to various factors, including ones outside of our control, such as natural disasters, acts of war … or disease outbreaks,” as well as “the ability to successfully manage global financial risks, including foreign currency fluctuations, currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility,” “the ability to successfully manage cost fluctuations and pressures, including prices of commodities and raw materials and costs of labor, transportation, energy, pension and healthcare,” and “the ability to successfully manage the financial, legal, reputational and operational risk associated with third‐party relationships, such as our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors and external business partners.” The report highlights resilience enablers such as productivity improvements, supply chain optimization, extended payment terms and supply chain financing arrangements that have delivered significant cost and cash‐flow benefits, including increased safety stock levels “to strengthen supply chain sufficiency,” along with investments in innovation and digital marketing to “stay on the leading edge of innovation” and adapt to changing consumer habits and technological advances. It stresses the capacity to protect reputation and brand equity by managing product quality, safety and supply chain practices, to maintain key customer relationships, to rely on and safeguard critical information and operational technology systems, and to navigate geopolitical, regulatory and environmental uncertainties. Further, the company’s strategic focus on developing “next‐level supply chain capabilities to enable flexibility, agility, resilience and a new level of productivity,” on sustainability, digital acumen and organizational culture enhancements, and on disciplined capital allocation through acquisition, divestiture and joint‐venture activities supports its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions.

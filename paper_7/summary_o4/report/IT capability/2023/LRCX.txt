Management acknowledges that forward‐looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect, including trade restrictions, supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures that may negatively impact revenue and gross margin. During fiscal 2023, while experiencing supply chain constraints in the first half, the company achieved improvements and fulfilled nearly all outstanding backorder systems in the second half of the year. In response to expected reduced business levels, a restructuring plan was initiated to better align the company’s cost structure with its outlook, resulting in workforce actions and related charges of approximately $107 million and projected expenditures of approximately $250 million over calendar 2023 for business process improvements and other initiatives. The company continues to make significant research and development investments focused on leading‐edge deposition, etch, clean and other semiconductor manufacturing processes, leveraging cycles of learning from its broad installed base and collaboration with semiconductor ecosystem partners. To balance customer requirements with resource availability and performance objectives, management exercises discretion in the timing and prioritization of manufacturing and deliveries, which has impacted revenue recognition timing. The company expects that secular demand for semiconductors combined with technology inflections such as three‐dimensional device scaling and advanced packaging integration will drive sustainable growth and expansion of its served available market. Strong liquidity is maintained, with cash, cash equivalents and investments increasing from $3.9 billion to $5.6 billion and net cash provided by operating activities of $5.2 billion deployed for capital expenditures, dividends and stock repurchases, while preserving sufficient reserves to support ongoing R&D and capital infrastructure. Anticipated cash flows based on the current business outlook are expected to support operations, investments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, capital redistributions and dividends for at least the next twelve months. The company recognizes that factors outside its control—including global economic and industry uncertainty and credit market disruptions—may affect customer demand and commercial relationships, and that longer‐term liquidity will depend on future revenues and its ability to manage costs effectively, with access to capital markets expected if required.

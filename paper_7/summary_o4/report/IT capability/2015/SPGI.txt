In 2015, we continued to focus on investments in targeted financial assets and on divesting selected non-core assets, reducing our real estate footprint and increasing shareholder return, using after-tax proceeds from asset sales to make selective acquisitions, investments, share repurchases and for general corporate purposes; our actions included the acquisition of SNL, Petromedia and UCG and the consolidation of our corporate headquarters in New York City. We began exploring strategic alternatives for J.D. Power, committed to an active program to sell it and classified its assets and liabilities as held for sale. We are aligning our efforts against two key strategic priorities—creating growth by executing our strategic initiatives, strengthening core capabilities and collaborating across businesses, and driving performance by delivering operational excellence, managing and mitigating risk and enhancing leadership and accountability. We recorded costs related to identified operating efficiencies primarily related to restructuring of $56 million in 2015 (versus $86 million in 2014) and achieved cost containment efforts at S&P Ratings through compensation cost containment and restructuring actions. We maintain a strong financial position, with cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities and availability under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program that we expect will be sufficient to meet operating and recurring cash needs into the foreseeable future. We use free cash flow—a non-GAAP measure reflecting cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends and other payments paid to noncontrolling interests—as a means to assess cash available for debt service, strategic acquisitions and investments, share repurchases and ongoing operations. We evaluate contingent legal and regulatory liabilities, recognizing reserves when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and we continually assess our liquidity, contractual obligations and capital resources to preserve or improve our functioning under varying market conditions.

We report our activities in our periodic disclosures to include statements about the objectives and effectiveness of our business continuity plan, information security program, risk management and liquidity policies, underscoring our focus on maintaining operations under stressed or exceptional conditions. One of our most important risk management disciplines is our ability to manage the size and composition of our balance sheet, and in order to ensure appropriate risk management, we seek to maintain a liquid balance sheet and have processes in place to dynamically manage our assets and liabilities, which include quarterly planning, business-specific limits, monitoring of key metrics and scenario analyses. We prepare a quarterly balance sheet plan that combines our projected total assets and composition of assets with our expected funding sources for the upcoming quarter, the objectives of which are to develop near-term balance sheet projections, determine the target amount, tenor and type of funding to raise, and allow business risk managers and managers from our independent control and support functions to objectively evaluate balance sheet limit requests in the context of the firmâ€™s overall balance sheet constraints. We maintain liquidity to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in a stressed environment and maintain our global core liquid assets to enable us to meet current and potential liquidity requirements of our consolidated organization in advance of potential cash and collateral outflows. We have in place a contingency funding plan that provides a framework for analyzing and responding to a perceived or actual capital deficiency, including identification of drivers of a capital deficiency, mitigants and potential actions, and we conduct various scenario analyses covering short-term and long-term time horizons under a range of macroeconomic and firm-specific assumptions to assist us in developing our longer-term balance sheet management strategy, including approaches for maintaining appropriate funding, liquidity and capital across a variety of situations, including a severely stressed environment. Our capital planning process incorporates an internal capital adequacy assessment with the objective of ensuring that we are appropriately capitalized relative to the risks in our business and stress scenarios to hold sufficient capital to ensure we remain adequately capitalized after experiencing a severe stress event, with this assessment of capital adequacy viewed in tandem with our assessment of liquidity adequacy and integrated into our overall risk management structure, governance and policy framework. Additionally, we maintain a comprehensive control framework designed to provide a well-controlled environment to minimize operational risks, enable timely escalation and remediation of process failures, and ensure continued service delivery and operational continuity under adverse conditions.

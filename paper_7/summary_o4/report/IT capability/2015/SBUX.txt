Starbucks’ 2015 annual report emphasizes the continued strength of our global business model underpinned by disciplined investments in our partners (employees), digital platforms and retail footprint expansion, demonstrating our ability to absorb pressures from ownership changes, foreign currency fluctuations and commodity‐price volatility while preserving and improving performance.  The acquisition and full consolidation of Starbucks Japan, including the related transaction and integration costs, illustrate our capacity to reconstitute and reconfigure strategic trajectories in response to disruptive events.  Supply‐chain improvements in sourcing, risk mitigation through forward‐starting interest rate swaps and commodity and foreign‐currency hedges, and proactive liquidity management via a revolving credit facility and commercial paper program further reinforce our operational flexibility and business continuity under varying internal and external constraints.  Our focus on service innovation—such as mobile order and pay—paired with continued net new store openings across the Americas, China/Asia Pacific and EMEA segments, reflects adaptive strategies and strategic agility designed to maintain integrity and market competitiveness in turbulent environments.  Capital expenditures for new stores, remodels, technology systems and capacity expansions, alongside measured use of debt and equity returns to shareholders, underscore a systemic perspective on resource allocation, risk assessment and resilience, enabling Starbucks to sustain functioning and grow despite challenging conditions.

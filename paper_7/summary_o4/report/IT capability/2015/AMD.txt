In 2015, amid volatility in the greater China region, reduced OEM demand ahead of the Windows® 10 launch and broader competitive pressures that led to a 28 percent decline in net revenue, the company undertook a series of measures to preserve operational continuity and adapt its organizational footprint. Management introduced a broader product portfolio—launching sixth-generation APU designs, new processor and GPU lines and server-class FirePro products—while accelerating expense reduction through a restructuring plan that reduced global headcount by approximately 5 percent, outsourced IT services, consolidated real estate facilities and drove approximately $8 million in operational savings in 2015 (with an estimated $48 million anticipated in 2016). The company also impaired inventory by $65 million, recorded a $33 million technology node transition charge and, following an annual goodwill impairment analysis, exited non-core businesses (including the dense server systems segment) with related intangible assets written off to realign resources around strategic priorities. To secure manufacturing continuity and mitigate supply-chain risks, the company amended its wafer supply agreement with GlobalFoundries to maintain fixed pricing and volume commitments, entered joint ventures for assembly, testing and packaging services under an equity interest purchase agreement, and leveraged sale-leaseback transactions and a secured revolving line of credit to redeploy resources, absorb external perturbations and sustain performance under adverse market conditions.

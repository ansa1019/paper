In its discussion of liquidity and capital resources, Nextera Energy notes that it and its subsidiaries, including FPL, require funds to support and grow their businesses, with primary sources being cash flows from operations, borrowings, issuances of debt and equity and proceeds from differential membership investors, thereby maintaining resource generation, deployment and continuity under varying conditions. Nee and FPL rely on access to credit and capital markets as significant sources of liquidity for requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows and maintain bank revolving lines of credit available to provide additional liquidity in the event of a loss to operating facilities, demonstrating operational flexibility and business continuity measures. At December 31, 2015 FPL had capacity to absorb up to approximately $119 million in future prudently incurred storm restoration costs without seeking recovery through rate adjustment, reflecting preemptive risk mitigation and crisis preparedness. Risk management policies include the use of derivative instruments—such as commodity, interest rate and foreign currency swaps, forwards and options—to manage exposure to fuel, electricity, interest rate and currency volatility, with unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses either deferred as regulatory assets or recognized in income, and a Value-at-Risk model that monitors positions at a 95% confidence level. FPL’s deployment of reserve amortization under its rate agreement to earn targeted regulatory returns, combined with adjustments to reserve reversals and amortization to achieve a specified ROE, exemplifies adaptive financial and accounting strategies to preserve performance. Capital initiatives—including the modernization of the Port Everglades power plant, the replacement and upgrade of gas turbines and the strengthening of transmission and distribution infrastructure, as well as planned solar projects—illustrate proactive system transformation and adaptation strategies for sustainable operations. Nee’s and FPL’s maintenance of nuclear decommissioning and dismantlement funds invested in fixed income and equity securities, along with the accrual of asset retirement obligations, demonstrates long-term resource planning for extreme conditions. Strategic actions such as the formation of renewable energy partnerships, acquisitions, divestitures and the authorization of at-the-market equity purchase programs for NEP common units further reflect organizational agility, resource reconfiguration and a systemic perspective to emerge stronger from disruptive market and regulatory events.

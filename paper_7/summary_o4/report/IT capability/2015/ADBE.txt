During fiscal 2015, the company demonstrated its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning by integrating acquired businesses—such as Fotolia into its digital media segment and Neolane and Behance into its reportable segments—and by transforming its business model from perpetual licensing to subscription-based offerings (Creative Cloud and Document Cloud) that deliver more frequent updates, cloud storage and community features, thereby generating more recurring, ratable and predictable revenue streams and expanding its customer base. Management regularly evaluates and revises its assumptions, judgments and estimates underpinning revenue recognition, deferred revenue, provisioning for returns and royalty obligations—based on historical data, channel inventory levels, sell-through rates and market conditions—to adjust for unanticipated changes and mitigate risks to its financial position. The company proactively invests in network and data center infrastructure, utilizes currency hedging programs to offset foreign exchange impacts, employs interest rate swaps to convert fixed-rate debt to floating-rate obligations, and maintains a $1 billion revolving credit facility, short-term investments and cash reserves to ensure liquidity and operational continuity under adverse conditions. Strategic initiatives—including structured stock repurchase agreements, targeted promotions and new mobile applications—along with restructuring plans to realign resources and ongoing critical accounting policy reviews with the audit committee, further illustrate the firm’s capability to reconfigure trajectories toward the future, maintain integrity under internal and external disturbances, and emerge stronger from challenges.

Management’s discussion and analysis emphasizes business continuity and operational flexibility through a capital allocation strategy prioritizing acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases, disciplined expense management and a global cash management approach to mitigate liquidity and economic risks. Stryker’s commitment to internal innovation and investments in research, development and engineering, coupled with focused acquisitions such as CHG and the planned acquisition of Sage Products, reflects resource deployment and reconfiguration designed to maintain or improve functioning under challenging conditions. The Company’s global manufacturing footprint and use of forward currency exchange contracts to hedge nonfunctional currency exposures serve as risk mitigation mechanisms to absorb external pressures and preserve profitability amidst foreign currency fluctuations. Operating cash flow, which provided $899 million in 2015, constitutes the primary source of funding for operating needs, capital expenditures and significant recall-related payments associated with the Rejuvenate and ABG II recalls, demonstrating the capacity to respond effectively to disruptive events and extreme conditions. Stryker maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, self-insured product liability claims and uncertain tax positions, and conducts quarterly impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived and long-lived intangible assets to assess and adjust asset recoverability, supporting adaptation to evolving market and regulatory environments. Strong credit ratings, unused borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities and the suspension of share repurchases reinforce the organization’s resilience in addressing both anticipated and unexpected financial demands. Continuous monitoring of receivables in the southern European region and the evaluation of potential losses from legal and regulatory contingencies further evidence a systemic perspective on risk assessment, recovery and organizational robustness. The highlighted ability of its people to execute effectively, combined with disciplined management of operating, investing and financing activities, underpins Stryker’s capacity to maintain performance and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations, aligning with the maintenance of positive adjustment under adverse conditions.

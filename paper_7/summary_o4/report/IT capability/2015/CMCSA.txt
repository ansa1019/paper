Comcast’s 2015 Annual Report describes a suite of strategic initiatives and investments that collectively support its ability to absorb strain and preserve—if not improve—functioning under internal and external variations.  To mitigate upward pressure on programming and other operating costs, the company seeks to grow revenue in its high‐speed internet, video and business services lines, deploys advanced customer premise equipment such as X1 set‐top boxes, cloud DVR technology and wireless gateways to enhance network capacity and in‐home performance, expands its network of residential and outdoor Wi-Fi hotspots and broadens enterprise service offerings for large multi-location customers in order to adapt resource deployment to emerging customer needs.  Comcast maintains substantial liquidity and working-capital flexibility through commercial paper programs supported by revolving credit facilities, disciplines covenant compliance and actively manages debt maturities to ensure business continuity amid seasonal and cyclical advertising patterns, intense competitive pressures and other environmental perturbations.  The company continually allocates capital to original and sports programming rights, theme-park attractions and strategic acquisitions—including a 51% interest in Universal Studios Japan and an equity‐method investment in Atairos Group—to reinforce operational flexibility, dynamic capabilities and future orientation, while diversifying distribution platforms (on-demand, online, mobile) and service innovation to retain and attract customers, all of which align with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

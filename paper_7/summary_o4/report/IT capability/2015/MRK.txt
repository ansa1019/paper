During 2015, Merck continued to execute its research and development–focused strategy, advancing its pipeline and commercial portfolio while maintaining a disciplined approach to cost management and delivering capital returns to shareholders. Business development remained a critical element of the company’s strategy as Merck combined internal and external innovation to enhance its pipeline, acquiring Cubist Pharmaceuticals and CCAM Biotherapeutics, entering collaborations with NGM Biopharmaceuticals and acquiring Iomet Pharma, and out-licensing or discontinuing selected assets under its portfolio prioritization process, which also led to divestiture of its remaining ophthalmics business and ongoing review of existing assets to ensure optimal resource allocation. As part of global restructuring programs initiated in 2010 and 2013, the company sharpened its commercial and research focus by eliminating positions in sales, administrative, headquarters and R&D organizations, reducing its global real-estate footprint, and improving the efficiency of its manufacturing and supply network, thereby achieving or exceeding $2.5 billion in annual net cost savings and investing the proceeds to support its highest-growth areas. Merck continually monitors and refines provisions for aggregate indirect customer discounts and product returns based on inventory levels, evolving market dynamics and anticipated demand, and capitalizes inventory in preparation for product launches to support initial market needs. The company also evaluates, adapts and improves its organizational practices, portfolio and business continuity measures to meet customer needs and respond to evolving healthcare cost-containment pressures, competitive landscapes, regulatory changes and broader market volatility, believing that these strategic initiatives and resource reallocations position it well to sustain performance and emerge stronger under challenging conditions.

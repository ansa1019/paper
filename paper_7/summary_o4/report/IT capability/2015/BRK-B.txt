Berkshire Hathaway describes its operating businesses as managed on an unusually decentralized basis, with essentially no centralized or integrated functions and minimal corporate headquarters involvement in day-to-day activities, while senior management retains ultimate responsibility for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities, CEO selection, and the establishment and monitoring of corporate governance practices—including communicating the appropriate “tone at the top” and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues—to ensure strategic coherence and continuity under varying conditions. Our insurance operations emphasize the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength, with combined statutory surplus of approximately $124 billion at year-end 2015, enabling negotiation of bespoke reinsurance contracts, absorption of significant catastrophe losses (defined as losses in excess of $100 million), continuous adjustment of loss reserves and pricing, and management of underwriting volatility from shifting claim estimates, foreign currency fluctuations and tail-risk exposures in casualty, retroactive reinsurance and mass tort liabilities. Burlington Northern Santa Fe’s 9.8 percent increase in after-tax earnings in 2015 reflected service level improvements, higher system velocity and lower fuel costs, driven by capacity additions through line expansions, system improvement projects and fleet investments, and accompanied by proactive workforce adjustments and fuel-efficiency initiatives in response to weakening demand and fuel price declines; management anticipates potential volume declines in key categories and is positioning for lower coal volumes in 2016. Berkshire Hathaway Energy secures revenues and preserves performance through regulatory cost-recovery rate mechanisms, adaptive rate structures, diversified investments in wind, solar and transmission assets, and management of fuel and gas cost fluctuations, while PacifiCorp, MidAmerican and NV Energy adjust retail rates, wholesale contracts and customer loads to recover costs and sustain margins. Our manufacturing businesses responded to commodity cost deflation, foreign currency headwinds and slowing oil-related markets by restructuring cost structures, exiting lower-margin operations, pursuing bolt-on acquisitions and lowering raw-material and energy costs. In services and retailing, NetJets and FlightSafety increased revenues and adjusted labor arrangements, bookstore and newspaper subsidiaries acquired third-party logistics and broadcast assets, and home-furnishing, automotive dealership and direct-to-consumer retail businesses opened new outlets and integrated acquisitions to diversify revenue streams. Finance subsidiaries like Clayton Homes maintained low delinquency rates and current installment loan portfolios, funded growth through BHFC debt issuances tied to prevailing market conditions, and leveraged transport equipment leasing to raise lease rates, expand fleets and absorb rising maintenance and depreciation expense. Across the enterprise, Berkshire maintains substantial liquidity—approximately $61 billion in cash and cash equivalents at year-end 2015—prioritizes safety over yield, adheres to repurchase policies that preserve minimum cash balances, and continually evaluates market, regulatory, catastrophic and credit risks through forward-looking disclosures and rigorous reserve-setting processes to preserve organizational integrity and performance under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

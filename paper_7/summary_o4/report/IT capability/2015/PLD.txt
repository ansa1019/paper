Management believes the scale and quality of its operating platform, the skills of its team and the strength of its balance sheet provide unique competitive advantages and support the firm’s capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning under market perturbations. The plan to grow revenue, earnings, net operating income, cash flows and core FFO is based on rising rents driven by strong demand for logistics facilities, with in-place leases originating during low-rent periods offering room for growth and quarterly positive rent change on rollovers for the last three years. A successful development program involves maintaining control of well-positioned land and sustaining a land bank capable of supporting over 154 million additional square feet of industrial space, while acquisitions and development stabilizations are integrated with minimal increases in general and administrative expenses, reflecting operational flexibility and efficient resource allocation. To mitigate financial and currency risk and enhance continuity, the company borrows in functional currencies, employs derivative hedges to offset fluctuations, issues lower-cost debt to refinance higher-cost borrowings, maintains significant available credit facilities and monitors debt covenants. Operating fundamentals—improved occupancy and rental rates—are evaluated through a same-store analysis that removes compositional and foreign-exchange effects to measure consistent performance. Cash needs for development completion, new starts, property acquisitions, capital expenditures and debt service are funded through operating cash flow, strategic capital fees, distributions from and contributions to co-investment ventures, asset dispositions and diversified financing sources. The dividend policy balances REIT distribution requirements with retention of cash for capital improvements and future investments, while critical accounting policies for consolidation, revenue recognition, impairment assessments and derivative valuation underpin organizational intelligence, risk assessment, reconfiguring and system integrity.

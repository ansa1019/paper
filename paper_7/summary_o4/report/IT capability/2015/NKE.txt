Nike’s management discussion underscores the company’s capacity to maintain performance under challenging conditions, noting that “despite significant foreign currency headwinds, we delivered record revenues and earnings per share in fiscal 2015,” and that “while foreign currency markets remain volatile, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the long-term by executing against the operational strategies outlined above.” Central to this resilience is a strategic focus on expanding gross margin by “delivering innovative, premium products that command higher prices while maintaining a balanced price-to-value proposition for consumers,” “reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency, product design and innovation,” and “making our supply chain a competitive advantage by investing in new technologies that increase automation, help reduce waste and have long-term potential to increase both customization of our products and speed to market.” The company further reinforces its adaptive capabilities by “optimizing selling and administrative expense” through targeted consumer-engagement and infrastructure investments, “improving working capital efficiency,” and “deploying capital effectively,” all of which support operational flexibility and resource reallocation. In response to disruptive events such as west coast port congestion, Nike incurred “higher air freight costs … in part to mitigate the negative impacts from product delays,” and continues to diversify distribution by expanding direct-to-consumer operations globally. To mitigate external pressures, its foreign exchange risk management program “is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows,” employing centralized, portfolio-based hedging of material exposures. Finally, Nike affirms that “existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds … will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future,” reflecting a forward-looking orientation toward sustaining organizational health and continuity under adversity.

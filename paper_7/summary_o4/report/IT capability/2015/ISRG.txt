Management’s Discussion and Analysis describes a range of organizational measures and responses that together serve to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning under adversity, and position the company to emerge stronger from challenges.  These include obtaining and coordinating multiple regulatory clearances and approvals (FDA, CE mark, MHLW) across geographies to sustain market access, terminating and reacquiring distribution rights in Japan to secure control over sales and service, and implementing a sales‐type and operating lease program to offer customers flexible acquisition options while leveraging the company’s balance sheet.  The company has continuously developed and launched successive generations of da Vinci surgical systems and advanced instruments—standard (1999), S (2006), Si (2009), Xi (2014), integrated table motion and stapler products—thereby reconfiguring its technology trajectory, expanding functional reach, and responding effectively to environmental disruptions.  When field issues arose—such as the suspension of the EndoWrist Stapler 45 and safety notice on drapes—the firm initiated voluntary recalls and refinements in design and manufacturing processes, deployed replacement instruments, and maintained stringent documentation and customer communications to mitigate risk, preserve patient safety, and sustain trust.  The expansion of direct sales operations in the U.S., Europe, Japan and other OUS markets, coupled with disciplined service contract renewals and recurring revenue growth, reflects resource deployment and service innovation to maintain performance under fluctuating procedure volumes and transitional pressures (e.g., Affordable Care Act implementation, FDA morcellation guidance).  Foreign currency hedging strategies address external variations in exchange rates, and substantial R&D investments in robotics, imaging, instrumentation, and next‐generation platforms demonstrate future orientation and strategic foresight.  The company’s handling of litigation—entering tolling agreements, engaging in mediation, establishing reserves and managing legal costs—exemplifies crisis response and risk mitigation to limit collateral impacts on reputation and cash flows.  Capital management actions—including share repurchases, cash and investment balances, and long‐term contracts with suppliers and lease obligations—support operational continuity and financial resilience.  Together these strategic initiatives, reconfiguration of resources, operational flexibility and iterative learning processes embody the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions and the preservation of organizational integrity and performance in the face of internal and external disturbances.

The company’s 2015 results reflect a maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, as consolidated operating income increased 5% despite foreign exchange headwinds from a strengthened U.S. dollar by isolating underlying revenue growth and reducing operating expenses through benefit plan terminations. In its risk and insurance services segment, the firm delivers risk advice, risk transfer and risk control and mitigation solutions, underpinned by catastrophe and financial modeling services, demonstrating internal knowledge application and operational flexibility to absorb shocks. The detailed revenue analyses—segregating the impacts of currency fluctuations, acquisitions and dispositions—illustrate a systemic perspective and reconfiguration of resources to preserve performance under environmental perturbations. In consulting, the company adapts its service innovation across health, retirement, talent and investments and specialized management, economic and brand consulting to shifting global economic conditions, regulatory changes and client demographics, evidencing dynamic capabilities and strategic agility. Financial resilience is supported by multi-currency revolving credit facilities, targeted debt issuances and redemptions, and a disciplined approach to repatriating or permanently reinvesting foreign cash balances in response to tax and regulatory constraints, thereby ensuring operational continuity and liquidity under varying scenarios. Amendments to defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans, coupled with negotiated deficit recovery plans for non-U.S. pension obligations, exemplify proactive risk mitigation and resource reallocation to maintain system integrity over time. The company’s systematic management of legal and other loss contingencies through case-level reviews, actuarial analyses and probable insurance recoveries highlights preparedness for errors and violations. Finally, sustained share repurchase and dividend programs, supported by robust operating cash flows and strategic capital allocation, bolster the organization’s ability to absorb strain, preserve functioning and emerge stronger amid market volatility.

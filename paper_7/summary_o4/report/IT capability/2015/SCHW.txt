The company has established an enterprise risk management framework, approved by its board, that defines risk appetite and embeds oversight in a Global Risk Committee supported by functional sub-committees covering areas such as asset-liability management, operational risk, information security and privacy, compliance, model governance, and vendor management; the framework encompasses ongoing risk identification, measurement, monitoring and reporting, with early warning indicators and periodic enterprise-wide liquidity and capital stress testing under both market and firm-specific scenarios, as well as a capital contingency plan for low-probability, high-impact events.  To support operational continuity, schwab maintains two data centers “intended, in part, to further improve the recovery of business processing in the event of an emergency,” conducts regular backup and disaster recovery testing, and enforces policies and procedures designed to protect against internal and external fraud, cyber-attacks, system interruptions or errors and other disruptions.  The company’s liquidity management seeks to ensure access to diversified funding sources— including internally generated client cash swept to schwab bank, high-quality liquid assets, secured short-term funding lines at the Federal Reserve Discount Window and Federal Home Loan Bank, a committed unsecured credit facility, uncommitted bank lines, and an automatic shelf registration statement for capital market issuances—such that it can meet obligations under both normal and stressed conditions.  Capital adequacy is maintained above regulatory minima with target tier 1 leverage ratios of at least 6% for csc and 6.25% for schwab bank, supplemented by monthly capital planning and stress testing, dividend and repurchase policies, and an oversight process to align financial resources with strategic objectives.  Governance of legal, compliance and fiduciary risks is supported by defined policies, controls and training, while regular evaluation of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting enables the firm to adapt to evolving regulatory and operational challenges, preserve integrity and performance, and maintain positive adjustment under adverse conditions.

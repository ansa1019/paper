During fiscal year 2015, Microsoft focused on transforming the organization to support its strategy of building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world by achieving product development milestones, implementing organizational changes, and making strategic and tactical moves to support the central ambitions of reinventing productivity and business processes, building the intelligent cloud platform, and creating more personal computing. Recognizing that its industry is dynamic and highly competitive with frequent changes in technologies and business models, the company pursues a broad range of research and development activities to identify and address evolving customer demands, industry trends, and competitive forces, and acknowledges the need to continue to evolve and adapt over time in pace with this changing environment. Investments in devices and infrastructure aim to generate new growth even as they increase operating costs and may decrease margins, and the company will continue to deploy capital in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, technology areas, and acquisitions aligned with its business strategy. Liquidity planning reflects a systemic perspective on resource deployment and risk mitigation, relying on domestic and foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, operational cash flows, and access to capital markets to fund dividends, debt maturities, capital expenditures, and discretionary activities such as share repurchases, while retaining the ability to repatriate earnings or raise capital if needed. Microsoft’s success is highly dependent on its ability to attract and retain qualified employees worldwide by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, opportunities for career growth across diverse products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits, underscoring the role of human capital in preserving organizational health under external pressures. The company also manages financial and operational risks related to foreign exchange, interest rates, tax contingencies, indemnification obligations, and contractual commitments—including operating leases, purchase commitments, and long-term debt—through strategic resource allocation and contingency planning to maintain integrity and performance when confronted with macroeconomic, geopolitical, and operational uncertainties.

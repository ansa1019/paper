Mastercard’s 2015 MD&A highlights its ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions by leveraging a globally diversified business to protect results from localized economic downturns while transparently acknowledging U.S. revenue concentration risks; by continuously monitoring political, economic and regulatory developments to inform strategic initiatives; and by deploying comprehensive risk-management mechanisms—including business continuity planning, foreign exchange hedging activities, cyber-security defenses and settlement guarantee arrangements—to preserve operational continuity under internal or external disruptions. The company maintains robust liquidity with $6.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents and investments, an undrawn $3.75 billion revolving credit facility and a $3.75 billion commercial paper program for emergency funding, while employing strategic repatriation policies to reinvest foreign earnings and retain flexibility for U.S. operations. Its proactive capital structure management—through debt issuances, share repurchases and dividend policies—supports resource allocation and strategic flexibility amid volatility. In addition, management’s use of judgmental estimates to accrue liabilities for legal and regulatory contingencies, test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment, recognize uncertain tax positions and adjust revenue and incentive accruals against actual transaction volumes further exemplifies processes designed to absorb strain, mitigate risk, adapt to evolving conditions and preserve the firm’s performance and integrity.

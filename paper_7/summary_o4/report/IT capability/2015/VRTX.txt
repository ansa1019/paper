We maintain our financial strength through precision resource allocation across our marketed products and research pipeline while pursuing diverse research programs to balance the risks inherent in drug development, and we actively monitor discovery, research, clinical trials and nonclinical studies, frequently evaluating our programs in light of new scientific, business and commercial insights, with the objective of balancing risk and potential, which can result in abrupt changes in focus and priorities as new information becomes available. We have established a corporate compliance program designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems and the promotion of a culture of compliance, and we dedicate substantial management and other resources to obtain and maintain appropriate levels of reimbursement for our products, engaging in discussions with commercial insurers, managed care organizations and government health programs on a country-by-country basis and anticipating extended reimbursement timelines in ex-U.S. markets. We intend to rely on our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash flows from U.S. and ex-U.S. sales of Kalydeco and ORKAMBI as our primary source of liquidity, and we have available under our credit agreement up to an additional $200.0 million of borrowing capacity, while also considering strategic collaborative agreements, equity and debt financing and other transactions to strengthen our long-term liquidity profile. We expect that cash flows from product sales and our current liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months, although the adequacy of available funds will depend on patient uptake, treatment persistence, reimbursement levels, the timing and success of new product introductions and other factors. To support our facility and lease obligations, including commitments extending through 2028 and our planned lease in San Diego beginning in 2017, we review our estimates and assumptions on at least a quarterly basis, record restructuring liabilities and imputed interest costs at fair value and adjust these estimates as necessary to reflect changed circumstances, thereby preserving operational continuity and maintaining our performance under both nominal and challenging conditions.

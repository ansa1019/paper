Our discussion highlights that our non-discretionary, recurring revenue-based products and services are necessary for our clients to operate and generate a stable foundation that supports operational continuity and performance maintenance under evolving regulatory, technological and market pressures. We emphasize disciplined resource allocation through active portfolio management, targeted acquisitions—such as the integration of Open Solutions and the planned acquisition of community financial services assets—and capital allocation strategies, including share repurchases and facility consolidations, to reconfigure our operational capabilities, preserve or improve effectiveness and expand client relationships. We describe adaptive strategies and operational flexibility achieved via expense discipline, efficiency initiatives, scale economies, data center and real estate consolidation, and the development of digital channels and fraud and risk management products, all designed to help the organization absorb strain, mitigate adverse conditions and benefit from environmental perturbations. Our liquidity and capital resources management, which includes generating robust cash flows from operations, repaying and refinancing debt under revolving credit facilities and senior notes, and funding capital expenditures, demonstrates our capacity to maintain system integrity and meet obligations in challenging circumstances. Together with our focus on recurring contract structures and diversification across payments and financial institution segments, these measures collectively support our ability to sustain business continuity, adapt to disruptions and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

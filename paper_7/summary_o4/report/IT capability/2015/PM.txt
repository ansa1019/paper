Our discussion notes that net revenues and operating income are affected by the volume of products we sell, product pricing, currency exchange rate fluctuations and product and geographic mix, reflecting our capacity to maintain performance under varying market conditions; in the fourth quarter of 2015 we transferred the management of operations in Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Slovenia from our EEMA segment to our European Union segment, resulting in the reclassification of prior-year amounts without impacting consolidated financial position or cash flows, demonstrating structural adaptability; we recorded pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs of $68 million related to severance costs for the organizational restructuring in the European Union segment and, in 2014, $535 million of asset impairment and exit costs related to factory closures and a U.S. leaf purchasing model restructuring, evidencing resource reconfiguration and operational flexibility in response to disruptions; as a holding company, our principal sources of funds to service debt are dividends and debt repayments from subsidiaries that are not limited by long-term debt agreements in their ability to distribute cash, preserving our financial resilience; our 2016 guidance expressly excludes the impact of future acquisitions, unanticipated asset impairment and exit costs, currency exchange rate changes and unusual events and notes that the risk factors in item 1A represent continuing risks to this forecast, reflecting proactive risk assessment and planning for external perturbations; we define adjusted diluted EPS as reported diluted EPS adjusted for asset impairment, exit costs, discrete tax items and unusual items to represent core earnings, improve comparability and assist investors in analyzing our underlying performance; and we will revisit our share repurchase program as the currency environment evolves, illustrating strategic agility in capital management amid ongoing market volatility.

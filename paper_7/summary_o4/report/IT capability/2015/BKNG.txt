In its annual report, the company underscores its ongoing efforts to maintain performance under challenging conditions by evaluating operating results on both as-reported and constant currency bases, employing derivative instruments and euro-denominated debt as natural hedges to mitigate the impact of foreign-exchange volatility, and sustaining diversified revenue streams through agency and merchant transactional models across multiple brands and geographic markets. It adapts to disruptions in consumer behavior and technology shifts by investing in differentiated mobile and online offerings, expanding accommodation supply and distribution, and scaling marketing and advertising—including offline campaigns—to preserve market share and consumer engagement. The company allocates resources to marketing, technology and personnel, strategically pursues acquisitions such as Kayak and OpenTable to reconfigure its service capabilities, and maintains robust liquidity through a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, bond issuances and substantial cash reserves to absorb financial strain and support business continuity. It actively assesses and accrues for tax, regulatory and macro-economic contingencies—from sovereign debt crises to natural disasters and pandemics—and plans for seasonal and cyclical demand fluctuations, demonstrating organizational flexibility, risk-management processes and strategic resource deployment designed to absorb strain, adapt operations and preserve or improve functioning in the face of adversity.

Our business model is carefully constructed around the following attributes: industry’s broadest portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing semiconductors, which enables us “to solve more of these needs than can our competitors” and provides access to more customers and revenue per system, illustrating adaptability and competitive advantage; “a strong foundation of manufacturing technology and low-cost production,” with most production in-house to “help ensure a consistent supply of products for our customers,” supporting business continuity and risk mitigation; investment of more than $1 billion each year to develop new products, demonstrating resource generation and innovation; acquisition of mature assets ahead of demand when prices are most attractive and production on 300-millimeter wafers with a 40 percent cost advantage, reflecting resource reconfiguration and operational flexibility; “diversity and longevity in our products and in the markets we serve,” such that we are “not dependent on any single product” or application and some products generate revenue for decades, evidencing risk mitigation through diversification and performance maintenance; consistent growth in free cash flow and market share, with free cash flow reaching a record 28.6 percent of revenue and our primary source of liquidity being cash flows from operations supplemented by $3.22 billion of cash and short-term investments plus an undrawn $2 billion revolving credit facility, underscoring financial resilience and preparedness; ongoing efforts “across the company to align costs with growth opportunities,” including completed restructuring actions and gains on sales of assets, signifying organizational change processes, resource management and adaptation to external pressures; and management’s belief that it “has the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months,” reflecting future orientation, system integrity and resilience strategies under potential internal or external variations.

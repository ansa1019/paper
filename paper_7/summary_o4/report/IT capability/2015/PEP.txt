In our executive overview, we emphasize the monitoring of key indicators—volume, revenue, operating profit, safety, innovation, product quality, organizational health and productivity savings—to maintain performance under volatile macroeconomic, geopolitical and regulatory pressures, and we embed our “performance with purpose” strategy in human, environmental and talent sustainability to ensure long-term adaptability and operational continuity. We have established an integrated risk management framework, with board and senior management oversight and dedicated risk committees at corporate, divisional and country levels, to identify, assess, prioritize and mitigate strategic, financial, operating, compliance and reputational risks across our global operations, thereby supporting business continuity and system resilience. To confront ongoing uncertainties—including exchange rate fluctuations, resource scarcity, shifting consumer tastes and intensifying competition—we focus on upgrading commercial and digital capabilities, accelerating research and development, building e-commerce and foodservice competencies, and fostering inter-organizational collaboration and shared‐services platforms to reconfigure resources, reconstitute response trajectories and enhance systemic flexibility. Our multi-year productivity plans drive innovation in automation, optimize our manufacturing footprint, eliminate duplication, integrate the global supply chain and deploy new technologies to lower our cost base, improve resource deployment and preserve or enhance functioning during adverse conditions. We manage commodity, currency and interest rate exposures through global purchasing programs, hedging strategies and productivity initiatives, and we adjust our organizational structure, capital allocation and investment priorities—inclusive of disciplined share repurchases, dividend policies and targeted acquisitions—to ensure the firm’s ability to absorb strain, sustain positive adjustment under challenging conditions and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

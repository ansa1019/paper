The Company’s global expansion and focus on Netflix as a worldwide internet TV network demonstrate the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions by growing streaming memberships 30 % year-over-year while absorbing unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations through pricing changes and plan mix, and by allocating additional resources to increased marketing, headcount and content expenses—including more exclusive and original programming—to support rapid international rollout. To preserve service continuity and performance under high-volume conditions, the Company has built and continues to enhance its proprietary global content delivery network and scale cloud computing and payment-processing infrastructure, aligning technology and development and general and administrative investments with strategic objectives such as user interface, recommendation and merchandising improvements. Liquidity and capital resilience are secured through the issuance of long-term debt totaling $1.9 billion in 2015, maintenance of over $2.3 billion in cash, equivalents and short-term investments, and active management of contractual commitments—$10.9 billion as of December 31, 2015—for streaming content acquisition, licensing and production. Content capitalization and amortization policies are regularly reviewed and adjusted based on actual and projected viewing patterns to mitigate the risk of impairment, and contractual structures with multi-year commitments balance upfront payments with financial flexibility. Foreign currency exposure is managed through pricing adjustments and absorbing higher VAT rates, and income tax provisions and uncertain tax positions are evaluated under the asset and liability method to sustain organizational health and financial resilience.

The company reports that it “monitors global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis, and continues to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues,” and, as a result, “has undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years” designed to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under internal or external pressures. It emphasizes that “a continued commitment to R&D is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings,” and that it expects “to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future” in order to adapt and sustain competitive advantage. To maintain financial flexibility and business continuity, the company maintains high-quality cash and short-term investments, “continually monitor[s] the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify[s] our investments in order to minimize our credit risk,” and believes that its “existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, dividend payments (if any) and repurchases of our stock (if any) … for at least the next twelve months.” Working-capital practices include “inventory levels … impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand,” and deferred revenue on distributor shipments to manage uncertainties in price-adjustment credits and returns, thereby mitigating risk of obsolete or slow-moving inventory. The company’s financing strategies—such as its amended $750 million revolving credit facility, the 90-day term loan facility used to fund the acquisition of Hittite and repaid in full, and its board-authorized stock repurchase program—demonstrate operational flexibility, resource reconfiguration and preparedness for disruptive events. Its capital-expenditure plan, which calls for $140–$160 million in fiscal 2016 funded by cash on hand and operations, and the determination that future dividends “will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity,” further reflect strategic resource deployment and future orientation. The MD&A also details critical accounting and risk-management processes—including contract accounting judgments, impairment reviews of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (including annual goodwill impairment testing using the income approach methodology), acquisition accounting fair-value estimates for intangible assets and contingent consideration, uncertain tax-position assessments using a “more likely than not” threshold, and periodic evaluations of litigation contingencies—each of which embodies the company’s systemic perspective on risk assessment, reconfiguration of resources and organizational resilience in the face of evolving market and regulatory conditions.

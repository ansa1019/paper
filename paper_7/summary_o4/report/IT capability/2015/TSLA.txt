Tesla’s capacity to absorb strain and maintain performance under challenging conditions is reflected in its deliberate expansion and reconfiguration of production, service and financial resources: management transitioned to a new final assembly line, added a paint shop, body shop and stamping capacity, and achieved material cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies to support the ramp of Model S, the launch and production ramp-up of Model X, and the forthcoming Model 3; it continues to invest in cell, module and pack production at the Gigafactory in partnership with Panasonic, while broadening its retail, service and supercharger networks globally to ensure operational continuity and meet evolving customer needs; risk mitigation and liquidity resilience are advanced through multi-element revenue deferral and residual value guarantee programs, an asset-based revolving credit facility, inventory valuation reserves tied to demand forecasts, and convertible note hedges and warrants that protect against financial variability and dilution; the company’s dynamic allocation of capital expenditures—approximately $1.5 billion planned for 2016—and proactive assessment of funding alternatives under diverse economic scenarios further illustrate its systemic approach to sustaining integrity and positive adjustment amid internal and external disturbances.

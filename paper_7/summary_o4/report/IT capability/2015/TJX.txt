In fiscal 2016, we continued to generate strong cash flows, enabling the return of value to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases while reinvesting in the business by adding new stores, remodeling existing ones, and strengthening our infrastructure to support continuing growth. We implemented a multi‐phase wage increase initiative for U.S. hourly store associates to enhance workforce stability and allocate human resources effectively. To mitigate earnings volatility from changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases, we routinely enter into inventory‐related hedging instruments and record mark‐to‐market gains or losses, which are offset when the hedged inventory is received and paid for. Our supply chain and inventory management practices, including adjustments to packaway inventory and the timing of merchandise receipts, reflect proactive resource deployment and operational flexibility. We funded our qualified pension plan with voluntary contributions to address long‐term retirement obligations, demonstrating prudent financial planning. For fiscal 2017, we expect approximately $1.1 billion in capital expenditures—primarily for offices and distribution centers to support growth, store renovations, and new store openings—financed through internally generated funds. Our stock repurchase programs, dividend policy and credit facilities are calibrated based on assessments of excess cash flow, liquidity, economic and market conditions, and prospects for our business, ensuring financial resilience and operating continuity. Contractual obligations under long‐term debt arrangements, operating leases and purchase commitments have been structured to align future cash flow requirements with our strategic growth plans. Critical accounting policies—such as inventory valuation under the retail method, impairment testing for long‐lived assets, actuarial estimates for self‐insured casualty programs, and evaluations of uncertain tax positions—require ongoing risk assessment and estimation processes, supporting our ability to preserve integrity and performance under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

Visa’s management discussion and analysis describes a multi‐faceted approach to preserving and enhancing the company’s ability to absorb strain and maintain performance under internal and external pressures, including ongoing investments in scalable payments infrastructure and technology assets to support the global migration from paper‐based to electronic payments, dynamic liquidity management policies and treasury guidelines that ensure adequate funding for operating expenditures, settlement obligations, litigation exposures and strategic initiatives, the use of a litigation escrow account and U.S. retrospective responsibility plan to isolate and address multi‐district litigation liabilities without jeopardizing core operations, diversified sources of financing—such as a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility, commercial paper program, shelf registration and anticipated senior debt issuance—to optimize capital structure and respond to regulatory and market conditions, hedging programs to mitigate foreign currency volatility on revenues, adaptive client incentive and marketing programs designed to build payments volume and card acceptance, strict settlement guarantee risk procedures including collateral requirements, and disciplined expense control measures, all of which collectively support the maintenance of organizational integrity, continuity of critical services and the company’s strategic agility in the face of uneven economic growth, regulatory challenges, and disruptive change.

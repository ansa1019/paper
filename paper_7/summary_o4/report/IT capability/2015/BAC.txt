Bank of America discloses a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework, approved annually by its board and Enterprise Risk Committee, that defines clear roles, responsibilities and a risk-appetite statement across seven key risk types—strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational—and embeds a strong risk culture supported by a three-lines-of-defense structure. Senior management and the Management Risk Committee oversee a systematic process of identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling risk (IMM-C), including regular risk and control self-assessments, model validation and independent audit reviews. The corporation integrates risk, capital and liquidity planning through its ICAAP and CCAR submissions, employs rigorous stress testing—using both historical and hypothetical scenarios of severe but plausible economic and market shocks—and maintains contingency funding and business continuity plans that specify escalation routines and strategic actions such as asset sales, business divestitures and capital or debt issuances to ensure operational continuity and financial strength under adverse conditions. Asset-liability management is centrally coordinated in Treasury, with diversified funding sources, extensive high-quality liquid assets (Global Excess Liquidity Sources) and a time-to-required-funding metric to sustain obligations without new issuance, while liquidity coverage and supplementary leverage ratios compliant with Basel III further reinforce resilience. Interest rate, foreign exchange, credit and other market risks are actively hedged and limited through daily Value-at-Risk and stress tests, and the firm’s resolution planning routines prepare it to emerge stronger when confronting unexpected internal or external disturbances.

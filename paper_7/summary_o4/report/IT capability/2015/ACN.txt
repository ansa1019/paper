Management regularly monitors economic volatility and geopolitical uncertainty in global markets and “seeks to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions,” proactively planning and managing the size and composition of our workforce and taking actions as needed to address changes in anticipated demand, while deploying skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. We measure utilization to include “all billable employees’ time spent on chargeable work,” and adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies, pricing and mix of resources to mitigate the impact of labor cost increases on gross margin. We also “seek to manage foreign currency exposure” for costs not incurred in the same currency as related revenues through currency protection provisions in customer contracts and our hedging programs, thereby preserving financial performance under fluctuating exchange rates. Through continuous evaluation of contract profitability, cost‐management actions across sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses, and dynamic workforce planning within our global delivery network, we maintain stable margins and revenue growth in the face of internal and external pressures, reflecting an ability to absorb strain, adapt operations and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions.

The company’s management discussion outlines strategic initiatives and operational measures that support its ability to absorb strain and maintain performance under variable conditions. Throughout 2015 the company capitalized on an improving economy by enhancing omni-channel capabilities, providing integrated products, services, information and advice across all channels, and leveraging collaboration between merchants, stores and customer experience teams to differentiate through inspiring presentations and cohesive assortments. It advanced offerings for the pro customer via targeted marketing, a strengthened portfolio of brands and the relaunched LowesForPros.com to meet unique needs, improve productivity and optimize resource deployment. Expense productivity initiatives, including payroll hour management, optimized media allocation, reduced print advertising and scale-driven cost savings on indirect spend, along with expansion of in-home selling networks, underscored operational flexibility. A decision to exit the Australian home improvement market and redeploy resources to higher-return segments, coupled with the definitive agreement to acquire Rona, Inc., exemplifies portfolio reconfiguration and inter-organizational collaboration aimed at accelerating growth and reinforcing international presence. Liquidity and capital management strategies—diversified borrowing facilities, commercial paper supported by a revolving credit agreement, disciplined capital expenditure allocations, a share repurchase program and self-insurance provisions—mitigate external pressures, ensure business continuity and preserve system integrity. Impairment reviews of long-lived assets and equity investments and structured revenue deferrals for extended protection plans demonstrate ongoing risk assessment to preserve net operating profit under challenging conditions.

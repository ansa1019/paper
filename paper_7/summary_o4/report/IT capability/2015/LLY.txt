In 2015, the company pursued a diversified pipeline of approximately fifty new drugs in human testing and numerous preclinical projects, recognizing that a high failure rate is inherent in pharmaceutical R&D and that delays or termination of individual programs need not materially alter overall research and development spending. It completed the acquisition of Novartis Animal Health—integrating nine manufacturing sites, six R&D facilities, and a global commercial infrastructure—while divesting certain U.S. assets to satisfy antitrust conditions, thereby augmenting its product portfolio, manufacturing capacity, and global presence. The company manages foreign-exchange and interest-rate exposures through a controlled risk-management program of derivative instruments, seeks an acceptable balance between fixed and floating debt positions, and maintains cash, cash equivalents, and available credit facilities sufficient to fund operating needs, capital expenditures, dividends, and share repurchases under varied market conditions. Wholesaler inventory levels are monitored and returns, rebate, and discount reserves are adjusted based on historical trends and anticipated channel dynamics to preserve financial integrity and business continuity. Long-lived and intangible assets, including acquired in-process research and development, are reviewed for impairment when indicators arise, with charges recorded for integration costs, severance, and intangible asset write-downs to maintain operational effectiveness. The firm’s tax strategy and valuation allowances reflect evolving U.S. and international laws to protect future cash flows, and critical accounting estimates—such as pension discount rates and expected return on plan assets—are reassessed annually to safeguard benefit-plan solvency. Contingent milestone and royalty obligations underscore the reliance on successful product development without jeopardizing broader financial stability. Despite significant external pressures—including patent expirations, pricing reforms, and regulatory uncertainties—the company increased dividends, repurchased shares, and realigned operating expenses, demonstrating its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve performance in challenging conditions.

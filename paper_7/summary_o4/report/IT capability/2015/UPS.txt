During 2015, UPS continued to adapt its global transportation network and operations to maintain performance under uneven economic and demand conditions. The company adjusted air capacity and cost structure to better align with prevailing volume levels, and leveraged a broad portfolio of product offerings and the inherent flexibilities of its integrated air and ground network to adapt to shifting intra-industry and regional trends. Multiple initiatives were undertaken to enhance network flexibility and capacity, including yield management programs, operational efficiency measures and cost containment across all segments. Technology deployments, such as facility automation projects and the on-road integrated optimization and navigation system (“Orion”), were accelerated to expand network capacity while improving efficiency, delivery flexibility and reliability. UPS also utilized newly expanded operating facilities to reduce time-in-transit and realigned its air and ground networks—realizing productivity improvements that lowered total cost per piece despite volume growth. In international package operations, capacity plans were modified through ongoing air network changes that enabled greater export volume with restrained aircraft block-hour growth, while coordinated base rate increases and fuel surcharge adjustments helped stabilize margins amid currency fluctuations and lower fuel costs. Within supply chain & freight operations, the company restrained lower-yielding forwarding volumes, negotiated purchased transportation rates and pursued acquisitions such as Coyote Logistics to strengthen diversified logistics capabilities, all helping to offset adverse market conditions and sustain profitability. Across all businesses, continuous monitoring of volume, rate, fuel and labor variables informed resource allocation and network reconfiguration, demonstrating UPS’s systemic approach to preserving or improving operational performance under pressures from economic bifurcation, currency swings and shifting trade patterns.

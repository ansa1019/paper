In its management’s discussion and analysis, the company outlines a multifaceted resilience strategy encompassing resource deployment, operational adaptation and financial flexibility. The company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions, integrating acquired businesses into its four reportable segments and reconfiguring operations through facility consolidations, headcount reductions, productivity improvements via its practical process improvement business system, global sourcing initiatives and a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, which yielded annual cost savings of $120 million in 2014 and approximately $100 million beginning in part in 2015. The company references productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and profit on higher sales in local currencies, while strategic growth investments and adverse foreign currency translation—resulting in a $938 million decrease in revenues in 2015—reflect its management of environmental perturbations. To preserve operational continuity, it maintains $452 million of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2015 and up to $2.00 billion of unsecured revolving credit, intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to ensure funds if commercial paper markets are unavailable, and believes that existing cash balances together with future cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet cash requirements for at least the next 24 months. Risk mitigation measures include allowances for doubtful accounts, inventory writedowns for excess quantities and obsolescence, interest rate swap arrangements, acquisition-related contingent consideration and accruals for product liability, environmental and litigation matters, as well as letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds, reflecting preparedness for internal and external variations and disturbances. Its critical accounting policies for intangible assets and goodwill—totaling $11.51 billion and $18.83 billion respectively at December 31, 2015—require annual and interim impairment testing upon indications of potential impairment due to adverse business conditions, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, thereby preserving system integrity. Tax planning initiatives generated additional foreign tax credits of $111 million and $80 million, reducing the effective tax rate by 3.4 percentage points, illustrating adaptability to evolving tax regimes. These strategic initiatives, financial tools and operational practices reflect the company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity, consistent with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

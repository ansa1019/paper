Costco’s MD&A underscores its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under adversity through continual adaptation of its business model, including adjustments to pricing and merchandise mix—such as increasing private-label penetration—leveraging selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales, and maintaining pricing authority to provide quality goods and services at competitive prices that reinforce member loyalty and sustain membership fee revenue. The company’s operational flexibility is supported by its consistent operating model across U.S., Canadian and other international segments, the use of LIFO inventory valuation with quarterly adjustments for inflation or deflation to match current costs with revenues, and ongoing investments in information-systems modernization to enhance business continuity and service innovation. Costco generates robust operating cash flows (over $4.2 billion in 2015) and maintains liquidity through cash and short-term investments of $6.4 billion, unused bank credit facilities of $407 million, senior notes issuances and disciplined capital expenditure plans, which include opening 23 net new warehouses in 2015 and planning up to 32 in 2016. Risk mitigation mechanisms—such as self-insurance via a captive insurance subsidiary and reinsurance program, foreign-currency forward contracts, irrevocable letter of credit facilities and regular impairment assessments of long-lived assets—demonstrate its systemic perspective on external pressures, foreign-exchange and gasoline-price volatility, and competitive landscapes. Its compensation philosophy of maintaining wages and benefits above the industry average aims to reduce employee turnover and enhance organizational health, while transparent accounting and governance practices—including rigorous revenue-recognition policies, evaluation of deferred tax liabilities on indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings, and disclosure of $17.8 billion in contractual obligations—reflect a multifaceted framework for preserving system integrity and performance under nominal, extreme, or exceptional conditions.

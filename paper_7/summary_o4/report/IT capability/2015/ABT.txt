Abbott’s revenues, costs and financial position have been impacted by external pressures including the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to international currencies and challenging economic and fiscal environments in several emerging markets, prompting manufacturing and distribution process changes, lower commodity costs and other cost reductions that drove operating margin improvements across its businesses. In 2014, Abbott expanded its global infrastructure by opening three new manufacturing plants in China, India and the United States and formed a strategic alliance with Fonterra to develop a proposed dairy farm hub in China to meet demand, while maintaining readily available financial resources through $5.0 billion of unused credit lines, a 364-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility and $2.5 billion of interest rate swap contracts to hedge interest rate exposure. The company regularly analyzes historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in rebate programs, monitors trade receivables in high-risk markets such as Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece, and establishes allowances to mitigate credit risk. Operational resilience is further evidenced by strategic restructuring plans—approving employee-related severance and accelerated depreciation charges to streamline operations and improve efficiencies—alongside the strategic sale of its developed markets branded generics business and animal health business, acquisitions such as Tendyne, CFR Pharmaceuticals, Veropharm, Topera and the pending Alere transaction, supported by bridge financing and diversified funding sources, illustrating resource reconfiguration to preserve performance. Abbott has also employed internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustments, developed long-term assumptions and amortization methods for defined benefit pension and post-employment obligations, engaged independent valuation experts to review intangible assets and goodwill for impairment, and plans to manage research and development spending at six to seven percent of sales through ongoing development of science-based products, next-generation platforms and advanced technologies across its nutritional, pharmaceutical, diagnostic and vascular segments—all while evaluating new accounting standards for early adoption to maintain system integrity and continuity under evolving conditions.

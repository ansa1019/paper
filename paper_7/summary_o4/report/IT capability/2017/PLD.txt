During 2017, the Company maintained robust operating fundamentals with 97.2% occupancy across its owned and managed portfolio, demonstrating its ability to sustain performance under varying market conditions; it completed several transactions that repositioned its portfolio and streamlined co-investment ventures—among them the sale, formation and acquisition of interests in Europe, the U.K., North America and Brazil—and contributed properties to co-investment vehicles, generating proceeds of $4.5 billion and realized net gains of $1.2 billion, thereby reconfiguring its resource base to preserve and enhance portfolio integrity. Financial flexibility was bolstered by amending and increasing its Japanese yen revolver to ¥50.0 billion, issuing £500 million of senior notes at a 2.3% effective rate to redeem higher-coupon debt, and drawing under unsecured term loans, steps that extended maturities, lowered borrowing costs and mitigated refinancing risk. Management evaluates core operations using net operating income by segment and same-store analyses to monitor resilience in rental revenues, recoveries and expenses, achieving increased occupancy, positive rent rate growth and the stabilization of newly developed properties. The strategic capital segment generated revenues from asset and property management fees and promote arrangements, allocating costs based on relative square footage to align resources with venture activity. In its role as sponsor of unconsolidated ventures with $8.1 billion of third-party debt, Prologis works to maintain liquidity and refinance maturing obligations, while acknowledging that voluntary capital contributions or property sales may be required. The Company considers its cash flows from operations, distributions from co-investment ventures, property contributions and dispositions, available financing capacity of $3.1 billion and potential equity issuances to be adequate to fund ongoing development, capital expenditures, debt service, dividends and strategic initiatives. Investment-grade credit ratings (Moody’s a3, S&P a–), compliance with debt covenants and active hedging of interest-rate and foreign-currency exposures support financial continuity, and dividend policies balance REIT distribution requirements with cash retention for capital improvements and growth opportunities. Critical accounting judgments regarding asset recoverability, revenue recognition, acquisition allocations and the capitalization of development and leasing costs further underpin the Company’s ability to preserve system integrity and maintain performance under internal and external pressures.

Goldman Sachs’ Management’s Discussion and Analysis highlights the firm’s resilience in maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions through a multifaceted risk management and continuity framework.  It emphasizes the objectives and effectiveness of its business continuity plan, information security program, capital, liquidity and operational risk management policies, and resolution strategies and recovery plans designed to absorb strain and preserve functioning in both nominal and stressed environments.  A comprehensive capital management policy, combined with capital planning and stress‐testing—including CCAR, DFAST and internally developed scenarios—ensures the firm remains adequately capitalized after extreme events, while its contingency capital plan provides a structured approach to identifying drivers of capital deficiency and executing mitigants.  Similarly, liquidity risk is managed through pre-funding potential cash and collateral outflows via global core liquid assets, diversified secured and unsecured funding, dynamic asset-liability management, and a contingency funding plan supported by scenario analyses and intraday stress models.  Cross-functional governance, embodied in formal committees and independent control and support functions, along with rigorous model validation and independent price verification, underpins strategic agility, operational flexibility and the systemic perspective required to reconfigure trajectories, adapt to environmental perturbations, and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

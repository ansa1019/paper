PepsiCo continuously monitors unstable economic, political and social conditions—including macroeconomic and political volatility, civil unrest, natural disasters and currency fluctuations—across more than 200 countries, and leverages an integrated risk management framework with board and committee oversight, cross-functional risk committees and a dedicated risk management office to identify, assess, prioritize and address strategic, operational, financial, compliance and safety risks, thereby preserving business continuity and ensuring the maintenance of performance under challenging or extreme conditions. The company has strengthened its capacity to absorb external pressures and reconfigure operations through productivity initiatives that have delivered over $1 billion in cost reductions, the refranchising of bottling operations in selected markets, the optimization of its global manufacturing footprint, and targeted investments in talent, digital solutions and e-commerce capabilities to adapt to retail disruption and evolving consumer preferences. Its diversified funding model—comprising net cash from operations, cash and short-term investments, committed credit facilities, commercial paper and long-term debt—supports ongoing capital expenditures, strategic share repurchases, dividend payments and tax obligations (including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act transition tax) without compromising operational flexibility. In parallel, enterprise-wide hedging of commodity, foreign currency and interest rate exposures and disciplined contract commitments for raw materials and marketing spend mitigate margin volatility, while rigorous internal controls, compliance and business continuity planning have enabled the company to sustain its integrity and resilience, as evidenced by the fact that hurricanes and earthquakes in North and Central America did not materially impact consolidated financial results.

Philip Morris International describes a strategic transformation toward a smoke-free future underpinned by multidisciplinary product development capabilities, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation to ensure its reduced-risk products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements, reflecting an adaptive response to evolving market and regulatory pressures. Effective January 1, 2018, the company reconfigured its operating structure from four to six reportable segments to align resource deployment, enhance operational flexibility and support its transformation strategy. In management’s discussion and analysis, net revenues and operating income are presented as functions of product volume and mix, pricing, currency exchange fluctuations and geographic and product portfolio mix, with adjustments in marketing, administration and research costs deployed to mitigate adverse conditions and optimize performance. The forecast for full-year 2018—projecting over 8 percent net revenue growth excluding excise taxes, operating cash flow above $9 billion, approximately $1.7 billion of capital expenditures and a full-year effective tax rate of approximately 28 percent—embodies forward-looking resource allocation and risk management measures, while explicitly excluding the impact of future acquisitions, unanticipated asset impairments, exchange rate volatility and unusual events and recognizing ongoing risk factors as challenges to business continuity and performance maintenance.

Comcast’s disclosures emphasize its capacity to adapt to and absorb external pressures through ongoing investments in scalable infrastructure, network capacity and customer-premise equipment—most notably the continued deployment of the X1 platform, cloud DVR technology and wireless gateways and the expansion of residential, outdoor and business Wi-Fi hotspots—to support service continuity and operational flexibility in the face of rapidly changing competitive and technological environments. The company acknowledges that competition “operates in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments and competes with a growing number of companies … challenging existing business models,” and it reports that it has “responded to this competition” through targeted sales and marketing programs, bundled offerings and platform innovation. In its enterprise services, Comcast has expanded to deliver software-defined networking and managed solutions “to offer enterprise customers support related to … business continuity risks.” To ensure resilience under adverse conditions and preserve liquidity, Comcast maintains significant availability under its revolving credit facilities and commercial paper programs and believes it “will be able to continue to meet … liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; available borrowings … and our ability to obtain future external financing.” The company’s capital expenditure program, which grew by 4.7% in 2017 to $8.0 billion, reflects a strategic allocation of resources toward network extensions, higher-speed services and business-services expansion, while planning for seasonal and cyclical variations in customer additions, advertising revenue and programming costs enables Comcast to maintain performance and system integrity despite fluctuations in consumer demand and periodic large-scale events.

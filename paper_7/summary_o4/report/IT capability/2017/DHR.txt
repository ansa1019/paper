Danaher’s MD&A describes how the company’s geographic and industry diversity, together with a broad range of products, software and services, helps limit the impact of any one industry or country economy on consolidated operating results, illustrating its ability to absorb strain and preserve performance under external pressures. Management reports that it monitors general economic trends along with key competitors’ and customers’ sales to gauge relative performance and the outlook, and that long-term growth and profitability depend on expanding in high-growth geographies and market segments, identifying, consummating and integrating acquisitions, developing innovative and differentiated new products and services, expanding and improving sales force effectiveness, reducing costs through productivity improvement initiatives and continuing to improve operating efficiency and quality, and effectively addressing increasingly regulated environments. The company is making significant investments, both organically and through acquisitions, to address rapid technological change and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources, in order to be responsive worldwide and improve operational efficiency, demonstrating resource reconfiguration, adaptability and future orientation. Within individual segments, the reporting of core sales growth, restructuring, impairment and other related charges for discontinued product lines, trade name impairments, acquisition-related charges and productivity improvement actions—all measured and disclosed in the discussion of operating profit margin variances—reflects ongoing organizational change processes, risk mitigation, dynamic capability building and system-level adjustments to maintain integrity and performance under challenging conditions.

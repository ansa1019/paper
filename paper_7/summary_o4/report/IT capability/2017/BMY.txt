Bristol-Myers Squibb Company has instituted comprehensive transformation initiatives enabling investment in its highest-priority portfolio opportunities and reinforcing its ability to absorb internal and external pressures while maintaining business continuity. By combining the resources, scale and capabilities of a large pharmaceutical company with the speed and focus on innovation characteristic of the biotech industry, the company focuses commercial and R&D resources on prioritized brands and markets, strengthens its R&D capabilities in tumor biology, patient selection and new biomarkers, delivers leaner administrative functions and streamlines its manufacturing network to reflect the growing importance of biologics. This evolving operating model is expected to provide the strategic, financial and operational flexibility necessary to adapt to competitive challenges and environmental disruptions, support disciplined capital allocation—including partnerships, collaborations and in-licensing of investigational compounds—and maintain a culture of continuous improvement. Management continuously evaluates the company’s capital structure to ensure efficient financing, monitors inventory levels and demand patterns through formal governance and forecasting processes to limit channel inventory strain, and relies on non-GAAP measures to facilitate consistent performance evaluation, resource allocation and strategic planning, all of which serve to preserve and enhance organizational resilience under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

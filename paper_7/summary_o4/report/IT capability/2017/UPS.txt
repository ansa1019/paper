In 2017 our operations demonstrated the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions as solid revenue and profit growth were partially offset by impacts from natural disasters, capacity constraints arising from unexpected volume surges, and incremental costs of facility construction and Saturday service deployment, prompting us to reconfigure our air and ground networks, automate sorting, expand capacity and develop weekend operations to absorb strain and preserve functioning. We refined our dimensional-weight calculations, implemented peak-period surcharges and transitioned to weekly fuel-index updates to mitigate cost volatility and safeguard performance under pressure, and we adopted currency-neutral reporting and hedging programs to manage external exchange-rate disturbances. Strategic investments in facility automation, information-technology enhancements and the acquisition of Marken and Coyote Logistics strengthened our resource deployment, service innovation and system flexibility, enabling rapid adaptation to shifting customer demands and turbulent market conditions. Internally, we supplemented GAAP results with adjusted measures to guide business-unit resource allocation, incentive compensation and future-orientation planning, and we maintained robust cash flow, diverse financing sources and disciplined capital structure management to ensure sufficient financial resources for ongoing capital expenditure programs, dividends and share repurchases, thereby reinforcing our organizational resilience and capacity to reconstitute and emerge stronger from adversity.

Management’s discussion emphasizes forward‐looking statements as inherently uncertain, noting that actual results could differ materially due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events and other risks. We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, as well as borrowing available under our credit agreements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment; increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer‐term strategic initiatives. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability and earning customer trust. We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs; to decrease our variable costs on a per‐unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes; to minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash‐generating operating cycle, although we expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third‐party sellers, our continuing focus on in‐stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize third‐party fulfillment providers. We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in‐stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services; we regularly evaluate our facility requirements. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including AWS and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies; to best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices and AWS services. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long‐term, and we seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain capital, finance and operating lease arrangements, repurchase common stock, pay dividends or repurchase, refinance or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position, and from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing or issue additional equity or debt securities.

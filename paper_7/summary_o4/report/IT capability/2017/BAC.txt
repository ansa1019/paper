Bank of America’s 2017 Form 10-K describes a robust enterprise risk and contingency management framework designed to sustain the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.  The Corporation operates under a board-approved risk appetite that explicitly identifies strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks and establishes limits and escalation procedures.  Management conducts regular strategic and financial planning reviews, including capital scenario management and stress forecasting as part of its internal capital adequacy assessment process, to evaluate the impact of adverse economic and market scenarios on earnings, capital and liquidity.  Contingency funding and recovery plans, single-point-of-entry resolution strategies and a centralized asset-liability management function are maintained to ensure access to diverse funding sources, preserve operational flexibility and support business continuity during internal or external disturbances.  Liquidity is managed through global liquidity sources—cash and high-quality, unencumbered securities—held by the parent and key subsidiaries, together with secured and unsecured financing and deposit funding, while capital is governed by basel III transition and fully phased-in requirements, including supplementary leverage and total loss-absorbing capacity buffers.  The enterprise model risk committee oversees validation of quantitative models used for risk measurement, including value-at-risk, counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments and mortgage rate risk hedges, and external auditors and independent risk functions provide ongoing challenge and testing.  Through these integrated governance, planning and risk-mitigation practices, Bank of America reinforces its ability to absorb strain, preserve or improve operational integrity and emerge stronger from extreme or exceptional events.

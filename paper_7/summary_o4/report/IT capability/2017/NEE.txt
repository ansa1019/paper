In response to the material storm-related disruptions caused by Hurricane Irma in September 2017, FPL restored power to approximately 50 percent of affected customers within one day and to approximately 95 percent within seven days, used available reserve amortization under the 2016 rate agreement to offset nearly all of the write-off of storm restoration costs and plans to replenish those reserves through tax savings generated during the term of the agreement, demonstrating its ability to absorb strain and preserve service integrity under extreme conditions. Management’s practice of using adjusted earnings—excluding non-qualifying hedge activity, merger-related expenses and other items—as a non-GAAP measure for internal financial planning, performance analyses, reporting to the board of directors and performance-based compensation reflects a systemic perspective in maintaining operational flexibility and clarity of performance under variable market conditions. NEE’s allocation of $10.74 billion in 2017 capital expenditures to expand FPL’s generation, transmission and distribution systems and NEER’s addition of 2,824 MW of wind, 759 MW of solar and 785 MW of pipeline capacity, together with the completion of project sales and the buildup of a contracted development backlog, illustrates proactive resource reconfiguration and innovation to meet evolving customer needs and environmental turbulence. The use of derivative instruments to manage physical and financial risks in fuel and electricity procurement, power marketing and trading, combined with the maintenance of approximately $9.2 billion of net available liquidity through bank revolvers, commercial paper and long-term borrowings and the preservation of investment-grade credit ratings, evidences robust risk mitigation mechanisms and strategic resilience in accessing capital markets. NEE further accrues and records regulatory assets and liabilities to recover storm-related, decommissioning and asset retirement costs over asset lives and regularly assesses long-lived assets for impairment by comparing carrying values to discounted future cash flows, ensuring the continued maintenance of performance and integrity under internal or external variations and disturbances.

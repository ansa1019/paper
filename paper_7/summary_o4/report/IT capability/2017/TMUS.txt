Throughout 2017, T-Mobile has executed strategic and operational adjustments that align with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, demonstrating its capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adverse events. The company introduced and expanded its Un-carrier strategy to eliminate customer pain points, complemented by ongoing network improvements and the systematic build-out of low-band 700 MHz and 600 MHz spectrum licenses, thereby reconfiguring resource deployment to strengthen competitive positioning. It completed the decommissioning of the MetroPCS CDMA network to streamline infrastructure, renegotiated long-distance and toll contracts to reduce costs, and excluded uneconomical Lifeline customers from its reported wholesale subscriber base in response to regulatory changes. In dealing with losses from hurricanes in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, T-Mobile recognized insurance recoveries of approximately $93 million, continues to assess damage and work with insurance carriers to submit claims for property damage and business interruption, and expects further recoveries in future periods. Proactive liquidity and capital-structure measures—including securitization of equipment-installment-plan and service receivables, the redemption and refinancing of high-yield notes, and amendments to revolving credit and term-loan facilities—have optimized financing costs and enhanced financial flexibility. The retrospective reclassification of the imputed discount on EIP receivables to other revenues aligns presentation with industry practice and supports comparability. These combined initiatives illustrate T-Mobile’s multifaceted resilience, its ability to absorb disruptions, reconstitute trajectories toward the future and maintain or improve performance amid dynamic market, regulatory and environmental pressures.

Nike’s organizational resilience is demonstrated by its consumer direct offense realignment to enhance personal‐level connections at scale, leveraging digital platforms to accelerate innovation, deepen one‐to‐one consumer engagement and adapt its operating model; it invests strategically in manufacturing efficiency, supply chain automation, waste reduction, product design innovation and speed to market to reconfigure resource allocation and sustain business continuity under external pressures. The company expands its higher‐margin direct‐to‐consumer operations—including digital commerce and owned stores—ensuring operational flexibility and diversified revenue streams while managing working capital efficiency, disciplined capital deployment and infrastructure investments, including digital capabilities and new stores, to support long‐term growth trajectories. A centralized foreign exchange risk management program, including natural offsets and hedging of transactional and translational exposures, mitigates currency headwinds, preserves margins and reduces performance variability across geographies; access to a committed credit facility, commercial paper program and diversified funding sources fosters liquidity preparedness and financial strength under adverse market conditions. Endorsement contracts and marketing commitments reflect strategic resilience tools to maintain brand relevance and system integrity despite market and operational fluctuations. The use of non‐GAAP measures enhances visibility into underlying business trends and supports agile decision‐making, and segment reporting aligned to geographic and direct distribution markets enables managerial agility and responsiveness to environmental turbulence. Critical accounting policies—revenue recognition, inventory reserves, asset impairment assessments and contingent liability evaluations—ensure transparency and preserve organizational integrity and performance continuity in exceptional conditions.

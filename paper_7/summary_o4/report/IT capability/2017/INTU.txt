We operate in a dynamic and highly competitive software and services market characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements, and to preserve and improve our functioning under these pressures we have reconfigured our business model—from traditional, paper-based desktop offerings to highly available connected services—by implementing subscription-based licensing, delivering ongoing enhancements over multiple years, and investing significant resources in product development, marketing, and sales capabilities.  Our growth strategy depends upon our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, enter new markets, and drive broad adoption of our offerings, while our seasonally driven revenue model—where nearly half of annual revenue is generated in our third quarter—requires us to maintain operational flexibility and robust working capital management.  To mitigate risks to business continuity and organizational health, we have strengthened our information technology and communication systems, enhanced our privacy and security capabilities, and implemented additional security measures in response to rising fraudulent tax‐filing attempts, collaborating with state and federal authorities to protect customers and preserve system integrity.  We continuously monitor counterparty and tax risks, maintain a strong liquidity profile supported by cash from operations and undrawn credit facilities, and assess acquisition and strategic investment opportunities to ensure we can absorb internal or external variations, meet contractual obligations and debt service requirements, and sustain our performance under pressure.  We believe our available cash, investments, and anticipated operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our capital and liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months, and we will return excess cash to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends after addressing our operating and strategic cash requirements.

In 2017, the Company’s ability to maintain and restore operations under adversity was evidenced by its prompt response to a voluntary product recall—involving discontinuation of a third-party supplier, insourcing manufacture of Sage oral care solutions, resumption of shipping in October, and return to full supply capacity by year-end—demonstrating effective business continuity and operational flexibility. While restructuring-related charges, hurricanes, unfavorable mix and inflation reduced gross margin, these headwinds were partially offset by increased productivity, higher sales volumes and favorable foreign currency impacts, reflecting adaptation to environmental perturbations and preservation of performance. The prioritization of a capital allocation strategy that directed $831 million to acquisitions, $636 million to dividends and $230 million to share repurchases, together with disciplined use of operating cash flow, debt issuances and a global cash management strategy, underscores deliberate resource generation, deployment and financial resilience. Investments in the development of a global ERP system and expansions of plant and equipment to support sales growth further illustrate proactive capacity building and maintenance of system integrity. The use of adjusted, non-GAAP measures to exclude irregular or non-core items facilitates clear trend analysis and continuous operational improvement, while maintained access to commercial paper, existing credit facilities and robust liquidity management supports strategic agility, enabling the organization to absorb strain, manage risks and preserve or improve functioning under both nominal and extreme conditions.

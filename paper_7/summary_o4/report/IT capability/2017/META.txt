Management highlights that our financial condition and operations are subject to internal and external pressures and uncertainties, necessitating ongoing risk assessment and forward-looking plans to preserve business continuity and maintain system integrity under challenging conditions. We have invested significantly according to our roadmap in our core ecosystem—including the Facebook app, video services, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp—and in long-term technology initiatives such as connectivity, artificial intelligence, and augmented and virtual reality, to enhance organizational capabilities, operational flexibility, and capacity to absorb strain. Anticipated expense growth in security, video content, technology platforms, headcount scaling, data center capacity expansion, and office facilities reflects our proactive approach to resource allocation and resilience strategies. Cost of revenue increased primarily due to expanded data centers and technical infrastructure, underscoring our commitment to performance maintenance amid internal and external variations. Liquidity is managed through substantial cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, an undrawn revolving credit facility, and share repurchase programs alongside net share settlements for equity awards, demonstrating financial resourcefulness and future orientation. We continuously evaluate legal proceedings, tax contingencies, and lease commitments, adjusting provisions and disclosures as circumstances evolve, thereby reinforcing our capacity for positive adjustment, risk mitigation, and organizational adaptation. Planned capital expenditures of approximately $14 to $15 billion for servers, data centers, and network infrastructure further illustrate our strategic agility and multifaceted pursuit of organizational resilience.

In management’s discussion, Abbott describes a series of strategic and operational initiatives that serve to preserve and enhance organizational functioning under challenging conditions and external pressures, aligning with the notion of organizational resilience as the maintenance of positive adjustment under adversity. The company proactively shaped its portfolio by divesting Abbott Medical Optics, selling its animal health and developed-markets generics businesses, and completing acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere to diversify its sources of growth, expand access to new products, channels, and geographies, and reconfigure its resource base toward higher-growth diagnostic, cardiovascular, neuromodulation, nutritional, and pharmaceutical platforms. Integration efforts in 2018 will focus on creating an organization capable of sustained performance across newly combined businesses, underscoring operational flexibility and change management processes. Efficiency and margin improvement initiatives in manufacturing and supply chain, as well as strategic cost reductions and streamlining of operations through approved restructuring plans, illustrate response strategies to environmental perturbations and adverse market dynamics, such as the challenging conditions in various emerging markets that partially offset sales growth in China and India. The launch and international roll-out of next-generation Alinity diagnostic systems, designed to increase efficiency by running more tests in less space, generating test results faster, and minimizing human errors while maintaining quality, exemplify systems resilience and service innovation. Financial resilience is supported by disciplined debt management—including significant debt repayments, board-authorized redemptions of long-term notes, maintenance of an investment grade rating, and access to revolving credit facilities—alongside regular assessments of foreign currency translation impacts, as demonstrated by the revaluation of Venezuelan net monetary assets under market-based exchange rates and the recording of a foreign currency exchange loss to ensure accurate financial measurement. Abbott’s approach to risk mitigation and foresight is further evidenced by regular analysis of rebate trends to establish reserves, engagement of actuaries and valuation experts to monitor pension, post-employment, and intangible asset obligations and perform impairment reviews, and proactive tax planning to minimize audit adjustments. In research and development, the company plans to manage a diversified project portfolio with spending targeted at approximately 7.5 percent of sales, investing across diagnostic, pharmaceutical, cardiovascular, neuromodulation, diabetes care, and nutrition segments to ensure adaptive capacity and dynamic capabilities. Together, these measures reflect deliberate resource allocation, operational adaptability, and strategic initiatives designed to absorb strain, maintain integrity, and emerge stronger from internal or external disruptions, embodying the principles of organizational resilience.

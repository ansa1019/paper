Charles Schwab’s MD&A describes an enterprise risk management framework designed to preserve system integrity and maintain performance under both normal and stressed conditions by defining risk appetite, assigning risk identification, measurement, monitoring and control responsibilities across business and control units, and convening a global risk committee with specialized sub-committees. Specific policies and procedures address operational, compliance, credit, market and liquidity risks through periodic risk and control self-assessments, control testing, internal audits, net interest revenue and capital stress testing, early-warning indicators, and contingency funding and capital plans. A resilient business continuity and disaster recovery infrastructure—including geographically dispersed backup facilities, routine plan testing and communication protocols—supports rapid crisis response and operational continuity. Information security is managed through layered tools, controls and technologies, dedicated fraud and cybersecurity teams, contractual and monitoring standards for third-party providers, and regular employee training. Liquidity is preserved by diversified funding sources, intra-day and short-term cash management, secured and unsecured credit facilities and detailed cash-flow forecasting, while capital adequacy is maintained via internal buffers, comprehensive stress testing and compliance with regulatory capital requirements, enabling adaptive responses and continued functioning despite market turbulence, regulatory changes or unexpected disruptions.

During 2017, we sustained our focus on maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions by intensifying safety initiatives to reduce risk and eliminate incidents, achieving a 3% improvement in our reportable derailment incident rate per million train miles and engaging our workforce through programs such as Courage to Care, Total Safety Culture, and UP Way, our continuous improvement culture. Despite facing significant network disruptions, including the impact of Hurricane Harvey and operational challenges associated with the implementation and testing of Positive Train Control, we adapted by aligning resources with customer demand, preserving network fluidity, and ensuring surge capability of our assets. We employ a multi-faceted approach to safety and service continuity—utilizing technology, risk assessment, targeted capital investments, quality control, training, and employee engagement to detect rail defects, improve crossings, and educate stakeholders—to absorb strain and preserve performance under adversity. In 2018, our capital plan of approximately $3.3 billion, allocated roughly 70% toward renewal and improvement of existing infrastructure and the balance toward capacity and technological enhancements, remains flexible and may be revised if business conditions or regulatory changes affect our expected returns. We manage fuel price volatility through fuel surcharge programs that trail market movements by about two months, and we further strengthen financial resilience through diversified liquidity sources—cash, receivables securitization, revolving credit, commercial paper and bond issuances—while continually reassessing optimal use of cash from operations for reinvestment or shareholder returns. Our labor relations approach under the Railway Labor Act, which typically extends negotiations without service stoppages, together with proactive environmental and operational measures to reduce fuel consumption and enhance efficiency, reflects our systemic perspective and adaptive strategies to sustain integrity and performance in both nominal and extreme conditions.

Our MD&A discloses that in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, three hurricanes impacted our operations in the continental U.S., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, contributing approximately $662 million to net sales and incurring approximately $170 million of hurricane-related expenses, while supply chain benefits and expense control resulted in operating expense leverage in a positive comparable-sales environment. The enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017 resulted in a net $127 million charge, and the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 generated a $106 million benefit, both of which are integrated into the company’s financial and tax provisions. The company generated $12.0 billion of operating cash flow in fiscal 2017, which, together with $3.0 billion of long-term debt and $850 million of net short-term borrowings, funded the repayment of $500 million of floating-rate notes, $8.0 billion of share repurchases, $4.2 billion of cash dividends, $1.9 billion of capital expenditures, and acquisitions, while maintaining a cash position of $3.6 billion, of which $3.2 billion is held by foreign subsidiaries, and access to $3.0 billion of commercial paper programs backed by committed credit facilities, enabling the company to support its capital-expenditure programs, dividend payments, share repurchases, and debt obligations through the next several fiscal years. The company’s debt and liquidity management includes a five-year $2.0 billion credit facility expiring December 2022, a 364-day $1.0 billion facility expiring December 2018, and active compliance with covenants, as well as the use of derivative instruments to manage foreign-currency and interest-rate exposures. In addition, the company evaluates long-lived assets quarterly for indicators of potential impairment based on undiscounted future cash flows and fair-value estimates, employs a self-insurance program for general liability, workers’ compensation, employee group medical, and automobile claims, values its inventory using the retail-inventory method approximating the lower of cost or market, defers revenue and recognizes vendor allowances consistent with underlying transactions, and utilizes non-GAAP measures such as return on invested capital to assess capital-deployment effectiveness. These disclosures collectively reflect the company’s resource allocation, operational flexibility, risk assessment, continuity planning, and adaptive strategies designed to preserve functioning, protect financial performance, and ensure business continuity under adverse conditions.

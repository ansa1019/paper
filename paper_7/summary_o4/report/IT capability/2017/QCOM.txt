Qualcomm continues to invest significant resources toward advancements primarily in support of 4G OFDMA- and 5G-based technologies as well as other technologies to extend the demand for our products and generate new or expanded licensing opportunities, including within adjacent industry segments outside traditional cellular industries such as automotive, the Internet of Things and networking, and QCT results were positively impacted by growth in revenues related to these adjacent industry segments, results from our recently formed RF360 Holdings joint venture and cost reduction initiatives achieved under our strategic realignment plan. The dollar increase in research and development expenses in fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase of $372 million in costs related to the development of integrated circuit technologies, including 5G technology and RFFE technologies from our RF360 Holdings joint venture, and related software products, partially offset by cost decreases driven by actions initiated under our strategic realignment plan, and the dollar increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to $136 million in professional services fees for acquisition and integration services related to our proposed acquisition of NXP, $70 million in costs related to litigation and other legal matters and $33 million in employee-related expenses primarily related to RF360 Holdings. Other expenses in fiscal 2017 consisted of a $927 million charge related to the KFTC fine, including related foreign currency losses, a $778 million charge related to the TFTC fine and $37 million in restructuring and restructuring-related charges under our strategic realignment plan. In May 2017, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $11.0 billion in nine tranches of unsecured floating- and fixed-rate notes, with maturity dates starting in 2019 through 2047 and effective interest rates between 1.80% and 4.47%, intended to finance a portion of our proposed acquisition of NXP and other related transactions and for general corporate purposes, and our principal sources of liquidity include our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, cash provided by our debt programs and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans. On October 27, 2016, we announced a definitive agreement under which Qualcomm River Holdings, B.V., an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Qualcomm Incorporated, will acquire NXP Semiconductors N.V. for total cash consideration to NXP’s shareholders of $38 billion, subject to regulatory approvals and closing conditions, and while we continue to work to close by the end of calendar 2017, the transaction may close in early 2018. We believe our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, our expected cash flow from operations and our expected financing activities will satisfy our working and other capital requirements for at least the next 12 months based on our current business plans. We expect our business, particularly QCT, to continue to be impacted by industry dynamics including concentration of device share among a few premium-tier companies, decisions by companies to develop or bundle their own integrated circuit products, decisions by certain companies to utilize our competitors’ products in all or a portion of their devices, intense competition particularly in China and lengthening replacement cycles in developed regions. We continue to believe that certain licensees, particularly in China, are not fully complying with their contractual obligations to report their sales of licensed products to us and that litigation or other enforcement actions may be necessary to compel licensees to report and pay required royalties, and we are currently in dispute with Apple and its contract manufacturers as to the amount of royalties due, have taken action to compel payment and expect these disputes will require ongoing legal costs, impacting our revenues, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows until resolved. Many of our products and intellectual property are subject to seasonality and demand fluctuations, causing QCT to have stronger sales toward the end of the calendar year and QTL to recognize higher royalty revenues in the first calendar quarter when licensees report sales, and these trends may be impacted by network conversions, device launches and disputes with licensees. We continue to invest in targeted opportunities that leverage our technical and business expertise to deploy new business models and enter or expand into new industry segments such as automotive, IoT, data center, networking, computing and machine learning, and we devote resources to working with and educating stakeholders and regulators on the benefits of our business model and our extensive technology investments to promote a highly competitive and innovative wireless industry, while expecting ongoing challenges to our business model in various global forums. To manage variability and risk, we monitor our marketable securities and non-marketable investments for impairment, recognizing other-than-temporary losses when declines in value are judged to be more than temporary; we value inventories at the lower of cost or market based on assumptions about customer demand, competitive pricing and product life cycles; we test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment and review long-lived assets for recoverability when indicators arise; and we accrue for legal, regulatory and tax contingencies when losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated, revising our provisions as facts and circumstances change.

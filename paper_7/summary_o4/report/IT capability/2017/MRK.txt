In 2017, Merck experienced a network cyber‐attack that disrupted its worldwide operations, including manufacturing, research and sales functions, yet quickly restored all manufacturing sites to operational status, continued to fulfill orders and ship product, recorded remediation efforts within materials and production, marketing and administrative and research and development expenses, leveraged insurance coverage, and temporarily borrowed and replenished Gardasil 9 doses from the CDC pediatric vaccine stockpile to minimize disruptions to vaccine supply; in September 2017, Hurricane Maria made landfall on Puerto Rico, where Merck’s plant avoided substantial damage, promptly resumed production activities, prepared alternative sources of power and water and progressed toward full restoration of operations amid impaired infrastructure and supply chains; concurrently, Merck pursued productivity and cost reduction initiatives, including global restructuring programs to streamline its cost structure through workforce reductions, the sale or closure of manufacturing and R&D sites and office consolidations, while continuing capital investments to optimize its manufacturing and supply network; the company strategically prioritized and reconfigured its R&D pipeline via increased clinical development spending, disciplined impairment and reprioritization of in-process research and development assets and expanded external innovation through collaborations and acquisitions, exemplified by its global oncology collaboration with AstraZeneca, co-development and co-promotion arrangements with Pfizer, the acquisition of Rigontec and the controlling interest in Vallée, to reconstitute temporal trajectories toward future growth; and it maintained business continuity and managed risk by preserving a strong liquidity position, including a $6 billion credit facility, active foreign exchange hedging programs and robust operating cash flows to fund R&D, capital expenditures and shareholder returns.

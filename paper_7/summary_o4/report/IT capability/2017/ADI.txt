In fiscal 2017, we monitored global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis and continued to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues, resulting in various restructuring actions designed to optimize resource deployment, mitigate risk, and preserve functioning under adverse conditions. The early retirement and cost‐reduction initiatives, which generated estimated annual salary, variable compensation and benefit savings of approximately $28.4 million and $5.0 million respectively, will be used to make additional investments in innovative technologies, processes and products to drive future revenue growth and maintain competitive advantage. Our acquisition integration process included the remittance of $1.6 billion of cash and marketable securities from foreign jurisdictions, along with the consolidation of legacy cash outside the United States of approximately $3.6 billion, actions that reflect our systemic perspective toward preserving organizational integrity and flexibility across geographies. We maintain high credit quality counterparty relationships, diversify our cash and cash equivalents to minimize credit risk, and believe that existing and anticipated sources of liquidity, including cash generated from operations and available long‐term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and dividend payments for at least the next twelve months. Capital allocations of $204.1 million in fiscal 2017 and expected outlays of $230.0 million to $270.0 million in fiscal 2018 for property, plant and equipment, coupled with continued commitments to research and development—reflected by $968.6 million invested in fiscal 2017 and hundreds of concurrent R&D projects—underscore our proactive measures to absorb strain, adapt to environmental disturbances, and maintain product leadership. Risk mitigation practices include deferring revenue and cost of sales on shipments to certain distributors until product resale due to uncertainties in price‐adjustment credits; maintaining allowances for doubtful accounts; and conducting impairment assessments on long‐lived assets, indefinite‐lived intangible assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate potential loss of value. We also account for contingent consideration in business combinations at fair value, reassess these obligations each reporting period, evaluate uncertain tax positions on a “more likely than not” basis, and manage debt obligations—including bridge loans, term loans and senior unsecured notes—within established leverage and lien covenants to preserve operational continuity and organizational resilience under varying financial and economic conditions.

While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private label items, and by leveraging comparable sales growth to reduce selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales and enhance profitability. Our investments in merchandise pricing can, from time to time, include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, thereby demonstrating operational flexibility under varying cost pressures. We operate our lower-margin gasoline business in all countries except Korea and France and explicitly manage the impacts of rising or declining gasoline prices on net sales growth, gross margin percentage and SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, reflecting our risk-mitigation and strategic response mechanisms to environmental perturbations. Because our financial performance depends heavily on our ability to control costs, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize employee wages and benefits but rather to maintain compensation levels better than the industry average to reduce turnover and enhance employee satisfaction, underscoring our system-level perspective on organizational health and our focus on sustaining functioning under internal variations. Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada and other international operating segments, with certain countries exhibiting relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wages and benefit costs as a percentage of sales, and varied competitive dynamics; this consistency, combined with disciplined capital expenditure plans of approximately $2,500 to $2,700 million financed through operating cash flows and short-term investments, illustrates our capacity for resource allocation, future orientation and maintenance of continuity in expansion and technology modernization. We maintain robust liquidity through cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $5,779 million at year-end, bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes, and a deferred revenue model for membership fees recognized ratably over one year, all of which management believes will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future, thereby preserving system integrity and performance under varying internal and external pressures.

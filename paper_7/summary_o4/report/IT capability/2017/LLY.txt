The Company’s MD&A emphasizes a comprehensive risk management framework and forward‐looking disclosures that support organizational resilience by preserving business continuity and operational flexibility amid evolving market, regulatory, and economic pressures. It describes strategic resource allocation across its research and development portfolio to absorb the inherent high failure risk of pharmaceutical innovation and sustain firm performance, as well as disciplined accruals for sales returns, rebates and discounts and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets under changing conditions. Adaptation to competitive and external disruptions—such as patent expirations, generic entry, pricing and reimbursement reforms, foreign currency fluctuations, and the 2017 Tax Act’s transition tax—is facilitated through derivative programs for interest rate and currency hedging, committed bank credit facilities, prudent liquidity management, and the ability to elect phased tax payments. Asset impairment, restructuring and other special charges, including cost‐structure realignment and voluntary early retirement initiatives, reflect organizational reconfiguration to maintain integrity and performance under adverse conditions. The Company’s monitoring of deteriorating economies, consideration of strategic alternatives for its animal health segment, and contractual flexibility to discontinue underperforming development projects further demonstrate its capacity for positive adjustment and transformation in the face of uncertainty.

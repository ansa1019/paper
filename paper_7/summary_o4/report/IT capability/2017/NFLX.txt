Netflix discloses that its multiple-year, largely fixed-cost content commitments and accelerated payment requirements may limit its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the markets in which it operates and that if membership and/or revenue growth do not meet expectations, margins, liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected. The Company acknowledges risks of unforeseen costs and potential liability in acquiring, producing, licensing and distributing content, including “completion and key talent risk” and accelerated upfront cash payments for original programming, and reserves the right to remove or alter content if it may damage its brand or fail to meet consumer expectations. Netflix warns that it must manage change and growth—expanding internationally, scaling its service and building expertise across creative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and other disciplines—to address varied content offerings, consumer customs, differing regulatory environments and the growing complexity of its operations or risk business harm. It depends on third-party “cloud” computing services and its own global content delivery network, but any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to its systems—whether from natural disasters, power loss, network failures, cyber-attacks or terrorism—could result in service degradation, data loss or theft of intellectual property, impairing customer satisfaction and its reputation despite systems and processes implemented to thwart hackers. Netflix also highlights the need for ongoing liquidity and capital resources to fund substantial investments in global streaming content production and licensing, notes substantial streaming content obligations and indebtedness that may limit its ability to react to downturns or adverse conditions, and stresses that it expects cash flows from operations, existing funds and financing sources will be sufficient to meet cash needs for at least the next twelve months.

The company acknowledges that its results of operations are affected by macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence and that there continues to be significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which may impact its business; accordingly, it continues to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seeks to manage its costs in order to respond to changing conditions. It proactively plans and manages the size and composition of its workforce and takes actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for its services and solutions, including evaluating voluntary attrition, adjusting levels of new hiring and, where necessary, using involuntary terminations to keep its supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand, and it adjusts compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. The company strives to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on its gross margin. Where practical, it seeks to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues by using currency protection provisions in customer contracts and through its hedging programs, thereby managing costs while considering the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. The company believes that its current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity under its credit facilities, and, to the extent necessary, from additional debt or equity financings; it may use these funds to facilitate purchases, redemptions and exchanges of shares and pay dividends, acquire complementary businesses or technologies, take advantage of opportunities for more rapid expansion or develop new services and solutions. It intends to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases, which may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time based on share price and other market conditions, capital allocation planning, cash and debt levels, other demands for cash such as acquisition activity, general economic or business conditions and board and management discretion.

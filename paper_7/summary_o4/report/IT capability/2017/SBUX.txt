The Company’s capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve its functioning under internal and external pressures is evidenced by disciplined resource reallocation and risk mitigation measures throughout fiscal 2017. Operating margin compression resulting from increased partner and digital investments, restructuring and impairment charges, and the absence of the 53rd week was partially offset by sales leverage, illustrating adaptive financial management under challenging conditions. Strategic repositioning of the EMEA segment toward a predominantly licensed model and aggressive rationalization of lower-return assets—including the planned exit of Teavana retail stores, closure of underperforming Canadian stores and divestiture of the Tazo brand—demonstrate the Company’s reconfiguration of its portfolio to focus on higher-growth opportunities and strengthen future performance. Liquidity and continuity are maintained through a revised debt structure, including a $2.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility, a $1.0 billion 364-day credit facility and an expanded $3.0 billion commercial paper program, complemented by disciplined capital deployment of approximately $2.0 billion in fiscal 2018 for growth initiatives, and by the indefinite reinvestment of foreign-subsidiary earnings to support ongoing operations. The Company manages commodity and currency volatility via embedded fixed-price supply contracts, price-to-be-fixed agreements and derivative hedging policies that set annual risk limits and restrict speculative activity, while interest rate and counterparty exposures are monitored to preserve system integrity. Consistent impairment testing of store assets, property and finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangibles, together with routine evaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, reflect a systematic perspective on maintaining performance and adapting to changes in economic conditions, business mix and tax regimes. These strategic tools, combined with sensitivity analyses on commodities, foreign exchange, equity and interest rates, underpin the Company’s ability to maintain positive adjustment, reconfigure trajectories in immediate response to disruption and reconstitute trajectories toward future growth.

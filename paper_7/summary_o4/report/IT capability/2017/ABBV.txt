Abbvie’s management discussion and analysis describes strategies and processes aligned with organizational resilience, including sustainable growth objectives through diversification of revenue streams, disciplined investment in pipeline innovation and targeted mid- and late-stage research and development collaborations, productivity and efficiency initiatives across supply chain, manufacturing and administrative operations to optimize resource allocation, and the execution of strong commercial launches to adapt to market disruptions. The company generates robust operating cash flows—$10 billion in 2017—utilizes these resources to enhance its pipeline, distribute dividends and repurchase shares, and maintains business continuity via a $3 billion revolving credit facility and long-term debt structuring to preserve liquidity and financial flexibility. Abbvie mitigates external pressures, including economic volatility, foreign exchange fluctuations and credit risks from government payers, by establishing allowances for receivables, monitoring customer creditworthiness and deploying risk management frameworks. By evaluating contractual obligations, contingent consideration liabilities and pension and tax reform impacts, Abbvie reconfigures its financial and operational trajectories to absorb strain, maintain system integrity and performance resilience under challenging and uncertain conditions.

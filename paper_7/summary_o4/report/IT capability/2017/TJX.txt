Management’s discussion and analysis begins with a note that forward-looking statements are estimates based on information currently available, made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and subject to the cautionary statements set forth on page 2 of this Form 10-K, reflecting TJX’s recognition of external pressures and uncertainties that may affect performance. The Company routinely enters into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases, while continued investments in opening new distribution centers and capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion planned for fiscal 2019 underscore strategic resource allocation and operational flexibility to support growth. Liquidity management, characterized by cash generated from operations supplemented by credit facilities and absence of short-term bank borrowings or commercial paper, demonstrates the firm’s capacity to maintain business continuity and meet operating needs under variable conditions. In response to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, TJX reinvested a portion of tax benefits through discretionary bonuses to associates, incremental contributions to defined contribution retirement plans and contributions to charitable foundations, collectively referred to as “incremental investments related to the 2017 tax act,” exemplifying the ability to reconfigure resources under exceptional conditions for performance maintenance. Moreover, the exclusion from comparable sales of 37 stores significantly impacted by hurricanes in Puerto Rico until they meet comp sales criteria further illustrates adaptive recovery mechanisms and risk mitigation processes. Financing activities—including the issuance of ten-year notes with proceeds applied to working capital and general corporate purposes, disciplined share repurchase programs, and a 25 percent increase in the planned quarterly dividend—along with prudent hedging drive organizational resilience by preserving system integrity and supporting positive adjustment under challenging circumstances.

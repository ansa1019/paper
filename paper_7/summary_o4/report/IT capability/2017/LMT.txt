The company reports that it “operates in an environment characterized by both increasing complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures,” and responds by focusing on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of product and service delivery, and placing security capabilities quickly into customers’ hands at affordable prices, thereby preserving or improving functioning under constrained resources. Recognizing that customers are resource-constrained and that funding can be disrupted by continuing resolutions, debt-ceiling debates or sequestration, it continually reassesses contract estimates and profit-booking rates under the percentage-of-completion method, establishes reserves for performance shortfalls on complex international, classified and commercial programs, and negotiates performance-based or progress-payment terms to mitigate funding and schedule risks. The company also shapes its portfolio through disciplined research and development, acquisitions, divestitures and internal realignments to align with national priorities and emerging markets, manages liquidity and capital structure with revolving credit facilities, commercial paper backstops, defined-benefit pension funding and share repurchases, and hedges interest-rate and foreign-currency exposures to maintain operational continuity and competitive advantage. These practices, supported by investments in technical skills and strategic foresight, illustrate how the organization absorbs strain, adapts its resource deployment and reconfigures its trajectories to sustain performance and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

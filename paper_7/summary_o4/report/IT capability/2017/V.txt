Management has adopted a range of strategic, financial and operational measures designed to enable Visa Inc. to absorb economic, regulatory and transactional pressures and maintain or improve its performance under challenging conditions. In February 2017, the company completed a legal entity reorganization to align its corporate structure with geographic jurisdictions, record a non-recurring tax provision related to deferred tax balances and transfer treasury shares to the newly formed Visa Foundation, thereby reconfiguring its tax and governance framework to support long-term continuity. Visa’s treasury policies and liquidity-management framework ensure adequate funding for operating expenditures, payments settlement, litigation obligations and capital investments by maintaining cash and cash equivalents, a diversified investment portfolio of government-sponsored agency debt, a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility, an approved commercial paper program and multiple issuances of fixed-rate senior notes. To mitigate foreign-exchange and settlement risks, the company employs a hedging program that offsets approximately one and a half percentage points of adverse currency movements, maintains global credit settlement risk procedures—including collateral requirements for clients—and funds a U.S. litigation escrow account under its retrospective responsibility plan to cover potential legal liabilities. Capital allocation priorities include continued investments in technology assets, infrastructure and digital solutions to support transaction processing and service innovation; share repurchase programs totaling $6.9 billion in fiscal 2017; quarterly dividend distributions; and the strategic acquisition of Visa Europe in June 2016 to achieve scale efficiencies, integrate systems and strengthen competitive positioning. In addition, management funds defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in the U.S. and U.K., commits to long-term client incentive agreements and marketing and sponsorship contracts to foster volume growth and acceptance, and periodically reviews forecasts of cash requirements and contingency scenarios to preserve system integrity and organizational adaptability in a volatile global payments environment.

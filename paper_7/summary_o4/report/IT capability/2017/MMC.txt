The MD&A describes a range of strategies, processes and capabilities that support the company’s ability to maintain performance and continuity in the face of external pressures and internal variations, including the provision of risk and insurance services—risk advice, risk transfer, and risk control and mitigation solutions—that help clients absorb strain and preserve functioning under adverse conditions; the systematic analysis of revenue and expense trends by segment, geography, underlying growth, acquisitions and currency fluctuations, reflecting the firm’s adaptability to environmental disruptions; expense management actions such as controlling liabilities for errors and omissions and adjusting defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans in multiple jurisdictions to optimize resource deployment, manage funding obligations and reconfigure financial commitments; proactive liquidity and capital resource measures, including repatriation of foreign earnings, maintenance of multi-currency credit facilities, issuance and refinancing of senior notes and share repurchase programs, which ensure access to financial resources and operational flexibility; segregation and fiduciary management of client funds to preserve system integrity and meet regulatory constraints; the assessment and provisioning for legal and other contingencies under a rigorous loss recognition framework; the handling of U.S. tax reform charges and the related reorientation of global capital strategy; and critical accounting judgments around fair value, unrecognized tax benefits and pension assumptions, all of which together illustrate a multifaceted and systemic approach to risk assessment, recovery, adaptation and the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

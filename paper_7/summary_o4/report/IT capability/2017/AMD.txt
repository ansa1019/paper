During 2017, the Company undertook a series of strategic and operational initiatives that collectively reflect a capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under evolving market and internal conditions. In its product portfolio the Company launched more than forty high-performance CPUs and GPUs spanning desktop, notebook, embedded and server markets, introduced a new “Zen” microarchitecture for multiple form factors and established a broader semi-custom and EPYC™ datacenter processor line, thereby reconfiguring its technology trajectory and mitigating the risk of competitive displacement. The Company continuously evaluates its demand forecasts and inventory levels at each balance sheet date, writing down obsolete stock and adjusting to projected sales outlooks, and has refined its goodwill impairment and income tax estimation processes by assessing qualitative and quantitative factors—including long-term performance prospects, share price trends and regulatory changes—to maintain financial integrity under external perturbations. To strengthen its supply chain resilience, the Company amended its wafer supply agreement with GlobalFoundries to secure technology collaboration for advanced nodes through 2020, obtained limited waivers to contract with alternate foundries, and established joint ventures for ATMP services and licensed IP in China, thereby diversifying manufacturing sources and leveraging inter-organizational collaboration. Concurrently, the Company implemented multi-year restructuring plans—reducing global headcount, outsourcing IT services, exiting the dense server systems business and realigning its real estate footprint—to simplify operations, sharpen investment focus and preserve operating flexibility. Liquidity was supported by extending and amending a secured revolving credit facility through 2022, managing debt maturities across multiple senior note issuances, and optimizing working capital, while cash flow from operations improved as revenue growth offset higher wafer purchases and investment in datacenter and high-performance products. These actions, taken together, illustrate an enterprise approach to sustaining performance under nominal, extreme and exceptional business environments by reconfiguring resources, adapting to external pressures and maintaining operational continuity.

Management’s discussion underscores that our forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in conditions, reflecting ongoing risk assessment and contingency planning for adverse developments; we maintain $6.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and an unused $750 million revolving credit facility to ensure operational continuity, sustain significant R&D and capital infrastructure investments and meet debt service requirements despite global economic and industry volatility; throughout the year we strategically allocated resources to R&D—driving a 13 percent increase in R&D expense and focusing on leading-edge deposition, plasma etch and single-wafer clean technologies—while leveraging cycles of learning from our broad installed base and collaborating with ecosystem partners to facilitate innovation in response to industry inflections such as NVM, multiple patterning and FinFET; our core technical competency in integrating hardware, process, materials, software and process control and our investments in improved factory utilization contributed to a 36 percent revenue increase and a 37.6 percent gross margin expansion, demonstrating adaptability to environmental perturbations; we continually monitor and adjust critical estimates—inventory valuation, warranty reserves and deferred tax assets—in response to customer demand, technological obsolescence and market conditions to preserve performance under disturbance; we manage our capital structure through the issuance and retirement of senior and convertible notes, the use of note hedges and committed term loans and periodic review of operating lease obligations to maintain financial flexibility; finally, our annual goodwill impairment analysis and periodic long-lived asset reviews employ discounted cash-flow forecasts and cost-of-capital assumptions to detect and address any declines in carrying values, thereby preserving the integrity of our reporting units and ensuring our ability to absorb strain and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

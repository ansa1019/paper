We frequently review our portfolio to ensure we maintain the right set of businesses to execute on our strategy, acquiring businesses when we identify a compelling strategic need—such as products, services or technologies that help meet client demand, change industry dynamics or achieve business scale—and divesting those not aligned with our market, product or financial strategies, thereby reconfiguring our resources toward enterprise priorities. We believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks necessary to be competitive are essential to justify investments that enhance operational flexibility and support positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including regulatory changes and cybersecurity scrutiny. Our services are largely non-discretionary, as they are necessary for our clients to operate their businesses, and we serve over 12,000 clients worldwide across our payments and financial institution services segments, which diversifies revenue, mitigates industry consolidation impacts and helps preserve function under external disturbances. We anticipate that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information, maintain regulatory compliance and offer innovative new services in a rapidly evolving marketplace, and we expect to benefit over the long term from the trend toward outsourced solutions as clients seek to remain current on technology changes. To ensure liquidity and capital resources, we maintain a $2.0 billion revolving credit agreement and a term loan bearing variable rates, alongside cash and cash equivalents, to fund operating expenses, service our debt and support capital expenditures and lease commitments, with covenants limiting consolidated indebtedness and requiring minimum EBITDA coverage that help us absorb strain and maintain organizational health. We continually evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates, review goodwill and acquired intangible assets for impairment annually or upon triggering events, and assess recoverability by comparing carrying amounts to the present value of estimated future cash flows, thereby upholding system integrity and performance maintenance under adverse conditions. Our key enterprise priorities of enhancing client relationships with digital and payment solutions, improving operational effectiveness, disciplined capital allocation and delivering innovation and integration reflect a systemic perspective and future orientation designed to sustain resilience, adaptability and competitive advantage.

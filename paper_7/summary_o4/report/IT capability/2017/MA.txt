While the global nature of our business helps protect operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries, we acknowledge that revenue concentration in the United States increases our susceptibility to U.S. downturns and that distress in financial markets, currency fluctuations, political instability and regulatory intervention have directly impacted customers, merchants and account holders, which we monitor closely to identify growth opportunities and evaluate industry evolution. Our networks are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments system, and we attempt to manage foreign currency balance sheet remeasurement and cash flow risk through dedicated foreign exchange risk management activities, recognizing gains and losses on foreign exchange derivatives as exposures materialize. We guarantee settlement of many Mastercard-branded transactions between issuers and acquirers and maintain liquidity and access to capital—including existing cash, cash equivalents, investment securities, cash flow from operations and committed borrowing facilities—to fund global operations, credit and settlement exposure, capital expenditures, investments and foreseeable obligations, while acknowledging that global credit market conditions or legal and regulatory proceedings could adversely affect our liquidity. Although historical payments under our settlement guarantees have not been significant, future losses may differ, and we believe that our financial resources, borrowing capacity and ongoing analysis of global working capital needs are sufficient to satisfy current and future obligations and preserve performance under changing conditions. Strategic investments and acquisitions—most notably Vocalink—have expanded our payments processing capabilities into a multi-rail network serving both domestic and cross-border transactions and enhanced our operational flexibility, thereby supporting continuity, adaptation and performance maintenance in evolving market and regulatory environments.

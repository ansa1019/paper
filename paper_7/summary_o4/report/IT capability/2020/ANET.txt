Management acknowledges unpredictability in the timing of orders from large end customers due to changes in demand patterns, evaluation and acceptance processes and order complexity, and expects continued variability in customer concentration and timing of sales on a quarterly and annual basis. Our future success is dependent upon our ability to continue to evolve and adapt to our rapidly changing environment, including by rapidly developing new features and applications through focused research and development on our EOS software, leveraging merchant silicon investments for cost-effective solutions, and expanding our sales force, marketing activities and partnerships to address growing market needs. In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental restrictions, we have prioritized the protection of our workforce by closing offices, limiting access to essential activities, instructing employees to work from home and implementing travel restrictions; worked closely with contract manufacturers and supply chain partners experiencing delays and disruptions; funded additional working capital and incremental purchase commitments; increased inventory by $235.3 million to help mitigate the impact of supply chain constraints; and continue to invest in working capital as supply availability improves, while actively monitoring impacts on financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry and workforce. We intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization to enhance platform functionality, introduce new products and features, and build on our technology leadership, and through the acquisitions of Big Switch Networks and Awake Security, have expanded data center networking solutions, strengthened our monitoring and observability suite and added an AI-powered detection and response platform. Our principal sources of liquidity—cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2020—together with cash generated from operations, are expected to be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and growth strategies for at least the next 12 months, although our future capital requirements will depend on factors such as our growth rate, research and development spending, supply chain access, market acceptance of our products and the availability of financing on acceptable terms.

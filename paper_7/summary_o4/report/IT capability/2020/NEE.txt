NEE and its subsidiaries require funds to support and grow their businesses, relying on a combination of cash flows from operations, borrowings or issuances of short- and long-term debt, proceeds from differential membership investors, sales of assets to NEP or third parties and, from time to time, issuances of equity securities, consistent with NEE’s and FPL’s objective of maintaining, on a long-term basis, a capital structure that will support a strong investment grade credit rating and preserve operational continuity. FPL’s increase in net income in 2020 was primarily driven by continued investments in plant in service and other property, which grew FPL’s average retail rate base by approximately $3.9 billion in 2020, reflecting investments in solar generation additions and ongoing transmission and distribution additions to meet customer needs and adapt to environmental disruptions. FPL’s service area was impacted by Hurricane Dorian in 2019 and by Hurricane Isaias and Tropical Storm Eta in 2020; FPL determined that it would not seek recovery of these storm restoration costs through a storm surcharge from customers and instead recorded costs as storm restoration costs in NEE’s and FPL’s consolidated statements of income, using available reserve amortization to offset all such storm restoration costs, as permitted by the 2016 rate agreement. NEE and its subsidiaries engage in derivative instruments to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity, using value-at-risk modeling to measure market risk and master netting agreements to manage counterparty credit risk, thereby reconfiguring their risk exposures and mitigating the impact of commodity price volatility. NEE and FPL are closely monitoring the global outbreak of COVID-19 and are taking steps intended to mitigate the potential risks to NEE and FPL posed by COVID-19, reflecting proactive measures and preparedness in a turbulent environment. NEE’s liquidity and capital resources are anticipated to be satisfied through operating cash flows, short- and long-term borrowings, issuances of debt and equity securities, proceeds from differential membership investors and sales of assets, with total net available liquidity of approximately $10.9 billion at December 31, 2020, ensuring the maintenance of performance and system integrity under internal and external variations. Additionally, NEE’s acquisition of Trans Bay Cable, LLC in July 2019 and the agreements to acquire GridLiance in September 2020 illustrate strategic adaptation and reconfiguration of trajectories toward future growth and competitive advantage.

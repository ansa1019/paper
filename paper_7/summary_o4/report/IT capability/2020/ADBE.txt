In response to the pandemic, our focus remained on promoting employee health and safety, serving our customers and ensuring business continuity by directing teams to work from home, suspending travel and replacing in-person events with digital events through July 2021, which enabled us to continue operations and maintain performance under challenging conditions. We discontinued our transaction-driven advertising cloud offerings to focus investment on strategic growth initiatives and realigned our advertising cloud offerings into a new publishing and advertising segmentâ€”actions that reconfigured resources, underscored operational flexibility and preserved the integrity of our core value proposition. Our subscription-based business model, ratable revenue recognition and deep cross-product integration of on-premise and cloud services provide predictable earnings and resilience in the face of nominal or extreme environmental disturbances, while our cash flow hedging program mitigates foreign currency risks. Significant investments in research and development, broadening our partner ecosystem and targeted promotions reflect an adaptive strategy to sustain long-term growth. We maintain liquidity through a $1 billion revolving credit facility, strategic debt refinancing to lower borrowing costs, structured stock repurchase agreements executed at a discount to volume-weighted average prices and robust working capital management, including regular evaluation of deferred revenue, trade receivables and critical accounting estimates, so as to absorb strain, preserve functioning and emerge stronger from uncertainty.

In 2020, UPS demonstrated organizational resilience through implementing a “customer first, people led, innovation driven strategy” to transform nearly every aspect of its business, enhancing capabilities in speed and ease of access, completing enhancements to its U.S. ground network to improve time-in-transit and deploying its digital access program to e-commerce platforms. In response to unexpected COVID-19-induced business shutdowns and government restrictions, UPS adapted its small package operations, noting a recovery in business-to-business activity late in the year and anticipating a persistent market shift toward e-commerce with higher residential deliveries. The company reconfigured its portfolio through the January 2021 agreement to divest its UPS Freight business, aiming to focus on core operations and expecting improvements in operating margin and return on invested capital. UPS managed external pressures, including reduced global air cargo capacity, by reallocating resources to meet increased demand and implementing capacity surcharges on disrupted trade lanes. Through an active capital structure optimization program encompassing commercial paper and senior note issuances, liquidity management via cash from operations and supply chain finance programs, and deferred employer payroll taxes under the CARES Act, UPS sought to ensure the integrity of its financial position and fund ongoing operations, planned capital expenditures, pension contributions and transformation strategy costs. Internally, management supplemented GAAP measures with adjusted non-GAAP metrics used for business unit performance analysis, resource allocation and incentive compensation, maintaining performance under pressure by excluding transitory items and focusing on recurring results. The company refined operational processes, including cost allocation methodologies, bond matching approaches for its defined benefit plans, and self-insurance reserves, to mitigate financial risks, and tested goodwill and intangible assets for impairment, recording a $494 million impairment for UPS Freight when classified as held for sale. Across supply chain & freight and international package operations, UPS reconfigured capacity and pricing—imposing peak and demand surcharges, adjusting fuel surcharges indexed to market prices, and deploying charter flights—to absorb strain and preserve service continuity. By evaluating working capital efficiency, leveraging third-party partnerships for peak transportation requirements, and projecting a trajectory model focused on reconstituting and reconfiguring responses to disruptive events, UPS maintained system integrity and performance, emerging stronger from adversity and sustaining long-term growth prospects despite ongoing uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 pandemic’s duration and economic recovery.

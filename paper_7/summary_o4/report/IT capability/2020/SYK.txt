In response to the severe disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic—including travel bans, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and the postponement of elective medical procedures that materially impacted our global suppliers, distributors and manufacturing facilities—we implemented operating expense savings actions, suspended our share repurchase program, increased our maximum permitted leverage to 5.0:1 under our credit facilities, issued additional debt and continued our disciplined capital allocation strategy by completing the Wright and OrthoSensor acquisitions while maintaining investment-grade debt ratings. We generated substantial cash from operations—driven by stronger accounts receivable collections, reduced inventory spend and higher accounts payable—supplemented by cash market issuances and existing credit lines to fund acquisitions, dividends and capital expenditures. Our global cash management strategy, supported by $3.0 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and diversified funding sources, is designed to preserve short-term liquidity, ensure business continuity, enable strategic investments and maintain financial flexibility under prolonged adverse conditions, thereby reflecting our ability to absorb strain, adapt resource deployment and sustain organizational performance despite external variations and constraints.

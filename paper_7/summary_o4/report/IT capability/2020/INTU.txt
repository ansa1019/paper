In March 2020 the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic and we have conducted business with substantial modifications to employee work locations and travel, among other adjustments, while monitoring potential disruptions to demand and the impact on customers and partners; in April 2020 we were approved as a non-bank Small Business Administration lender for the Paycheck Protection Program to provide loans for payroll, health costs, rent, utilities and debt interest, supporting small business continuity under extreme conditions. To maintain operational flexibility amid dynamic industry trends—such as the transformative impact of artificial intelligence, disruptive start-ups and shifting customer expectations—we continue to invest significant resources in product development, marketing and sales capabilities, our information technology infrastructure and privacy and security measures, including additional security protocols for our consumer and professional tax offerings and collaboration with government entities on anti-fraud initiatives, in order to absorb strain, preserve performance and strengthen competitive advantage. Our growth strategy depends on initiating and embracing disruptive technology trends, entering new markets and reinforcing third-party relationships to safeguard organizational health and long-term performance. Historically subject to significant seasonality, with higher net revenues in our second and third quarters, we managed shifts in revenue recognition resulting from extended filing deadlines and, in fiscal 2020, generated $2.4 billion in cash from operations, drew $1 billion under our unsecured revolving credit facility and issued $2 billion of senior unsecured notes for general corporate purposes—including funding the pending Credit Karma acquisition—reflecting a systemic perspective on capital allocation and resilience planning. At July 31, 2020, our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $7.1 billion, which we believe, based on past performance and current expectations, will be sufficient to meet seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditures, contractual obligations, debt service requirements and the impacts of COVID-19 for at least the next 12 months. In connection with the pending acquisition, we have temporarily suspended share repurchases while continuing to evaluate strategic initiatives and reconfigure our organizational trajectory so that we can respond effectively to environmental perturbations and emerge stronger from challenging situations.

The companyâ€™s management acknowledges that the outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus, declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, has led to adverse impacts on the U.S. and global economies and has impacted and continues to impact our supply chain, operations, and customer demand; even though the company has taken measures to adapt to operating in this challenging environment, the pandemic could further affect our operations and those of our suppliers and vendors as a result of additional shutdowns, restrictions on travel and logistics, potential product and labor shortages, limitations on store operations up to and including closures, and other governmental, business or consumer actions. As circumstances have evolved, our focus has been and continues to be on two key priorities: the safety and well-being of our associates and customers, and providing our customers and communities with the products and services that they need. In adapting to operations in a COVID-19 environment during fiscal 2020, we implemented a number of actions to promote social and physical distancing, including changes to store operating hours, limiting the number of customers in stores, canceling or modifying certain annual merchandising events, rolling out curbside pickup, and shifting store support operations to remote or virtual environments. As we continued to refine our approach, we adopted a more localized methodology for customer limits, expanded store hours, and instituted masks or facial coverings for all associates and customers in our U.S. stores and other facilities to promote a safe shopping environment. The impact of COVID-19 and our actions in response had varying effects on our results of operations throughout fiscal 2020, but overall we saw a significant acceleration in sales across our departments as customers focused on home improvement projects and repairs and online sales grew by approximately 86%. The increase in customer demand, together with the impact of COVID-19 on our supply chain, placed pressure on our ability to maintain high in-stock levels, particularly for certain high-demand products; we have been able to mitigate some of this impact due to the benefits of our strategic investments and by working cross-functionally and partnering with our suppliers to make real-time adjustments to our assortments, introduce alternative products, or reduce assortments to the most popular selections in certain categories. Given these ongoing demands and the complexity of the current environment, we have focused on taking care of our associates by investing in additional pay and benefits, including expanded paid time off for all hourly associates, the implementation of a temporary weekly bonus program, and the subsequent transition to permanent compensation enhancements for frontline, hourly associates beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, totaling approximately $1 billion of expected incremental expense on an annualized basis; collectively, these enhanced pay and benefits resulted in additional expense of approximately $2.0 billion in fiscal 2020. Although we cannot estimate the future impact of COVID-19 or the recovery from the pandemic, we believe our existing liquidity will be sufficient to continue to run our business effectively, and we also believe that the investments we have made in recent years in our stores, interconnected and digital assets, associates, supply chain, and merchandising organization have allowed us to quickly adapt to shifts in customer needs and behaviors and the fluid circumstances created by the pandemic. We continue to actively monitor our business and operations and may take further actions as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our associates, customers, suppliers, vendors, and shareholders. To further enhance our liquidity position in response to the pandemic, in March 2020 we expanded our commercial paper programs from $3.0 billion to $6.0 billion and maintained back-up credit facilities aggregating $6.5 billion, and we intend to maintain an elevated cash position during fiscal 2021; at January 31, 2021, we had $7.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper programs. During fiscal 2020, we chose to defer some of our in-store strategic investments to prioritize the safety of our associates and customers in response to COVID-19, with completion of these investments expected in fiscal 2021. For fiscal 2021, we will continue to follow our disciplined approach to capital allocation, currently estimating capital expenditures of approximately two percent of net sales, while reserving the flexibility to adjust capital expenditures to support the operations of the business or in response to the economic environment as necessary or appropriate. In December 2020, we completed the acquisition of HD Supply for net consideration of $7.8 billion, which we believe will help position the company to accelerate sales growth by better serving both existing and new MRO customers. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $5.2 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, primarily driven by an increase in net earnings and changes in working capital, which was impacted by the timing of vendor payments and higher merchandise inventories to continue to support increasing demand and replenish in-stock levels.

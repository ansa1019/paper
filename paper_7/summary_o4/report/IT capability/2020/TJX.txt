TJX temporarily closed all of its stores, e-commerce businesses, distribution centers and offices in March 2020, with associates working remotely where possible, and furloughed the majority of hourly store and distribution center associates while maintaining employee benefits coverage; it established several global task force teams to navigate the crisis, continuously monitored government requirements and consumer trends to adjust operations, and implemented enhanced health and safety practices including social distancing protocols, personal protective equipment and enhanced cleaning regimens. To mitigate supply chain and liquidity pressures, TJX negotiated rent deferrals for lease payments, extended merchandise payment terms, increased operating cash flows and raised $4.0 billion of senior notes alongside a $500 million revolving credit facility, ending fiscal 2021 with $10.5 billion of cash. It evaluated and revalued inventory in light of temporary store closures, recording approximately $400 million of markdowns and perishable write-offs, and concluded that triggering events warranted impairment assessments that led to $72 million of lease right-of-use and fixed asset charges. The company suspended its share repurchase program, declared modest dividends, moderated capital spending to $1.2 billion–$1.4 billion for infrastructure and distribution center investments, and realigned its European supply chain to address Brexit-related regulatory changes. Participation in government programs that offset approximately $0.5 billion of expenses, together with cost-savings initiatives, risk assessment processes and ongoing monitoring of developments, demonstrate TJX’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under adverse conditions.

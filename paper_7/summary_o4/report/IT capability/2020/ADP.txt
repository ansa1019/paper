ADP implemented its business continuity plan in March 2020 and shifted over 98% of its workforce to work-from-home or off-site locations to ensure uninterrupted service to clients, while closely monitoring macro trends via externally and internally available data to drive real-time decisions. The company continued to process payroll and tax obligations and provide HCM services despite unexpected challenges, rolling out a range of tools and reports to help clients through the crisis and prepare for recovery, including implementing over 1,000 feature changes in response to 2,000 legislative updates in 60 countries and providing an employer preparedness toolkit for relief under the FFCRA and CARES Act. ADP remains on a transformation journey, executing workforce optimization and procurement transformation initiatives and advancing a digital implementation and servicing initiative to yield efficiencies and adapt operational models. Its highly cash-generative, low-capital-intensity business model, robust free cash flow generation, suite of liquidity sources—comprising cash and cash equivalents, long-term marketable securities, a commercial paper program, reverse repurchase agreements and $9.7 billion of committed credit facilities—and disciplined laddering of investment maturities enable the company to absorb downturns, satisfy client funds obligations and maintain financial solidity, while investments in research and development and capital expenditures reinforce the integrity and performance of its systems. In its PEO services segment, ADP indemnity provides workers’ compensation and employer’s liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection up to $1 million per occurrence, with reinsurance arrangements in place to cover substantially all losses and assets reserved to reflect actuarial estimates, thereby mitigating risk and supporting continuity under extreme conditions.

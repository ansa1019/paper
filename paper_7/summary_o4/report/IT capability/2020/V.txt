Visa’s advanced transaction processing network, VisaNet, which enables authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and provides a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services, illustrates the company’s commitment to maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions through continuous investment in business continuity and service innovation. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, management prioritized employee safety and operational continuity by instituting remote work for most employees, maintaining close and regular communication with employees, clients, partners and governments globally, modifying business practices and reducing operating expenses through scaled-back hiring plans, travel restrictions, lower marketing spend and selective use of external resources, while systematically evaluating ongoing impacts to operations. Visa’s treasury policies guide regular evaluation of cash requirements for operating expenditures, capital investments, litigation settlements and shareholder returns, and the firm invests excess cash in securities structured to meet working capital and liquidity needs and to earn additional income. Primary sources of liquidity include cash on hand, operating cash flow, an available-for-sale investment portfolio of U.S. treasury and government-sponsored agency debt, a $3 billion commercial paper program, a $5 billion revolving credit facility maturing in 2024 and access to public debt markets, thereby ensuring operational resources to absorb internal or external variations. A U.S. litigation escrow account funded to insulate the company and its Class A shareholders from covered litigation liabilities, together with policies limiting credit exposure to any one financial institution and hedging programs to mitigate foreign currency volatility, underpins Visa’s risk mitigation framework. Management monitors credit ratings, assesses potential impairments in its investment portfolio, and plans pension contributions based on funded status and asset performance, demonstrating systematic risk assessment and resource allocation to preserve organizational health. Capital expenditures continue to focus on technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support digital solutions and core business initiatives, embodying strategic adaptability and the development of dynamic capabilities. The company maintains approximately $7.7 billion of global liquidity dedicated to daily settlement obligations, ensuring settlement guarantee mechanisms function effectively even if one or more clients default. Strategic initiatives such as the pending acquisition of Plaid Inc., subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory review, exemplify Visa’s forward-looking resource deployment and organizational foresight designed to enhance long-term resilience and competitive advantage.

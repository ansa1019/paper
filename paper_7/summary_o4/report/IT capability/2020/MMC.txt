Management’s discussion and analysis highlights the company’s maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, citing its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite internal and external variations and disturbances. In March 2020, the company took precautionary steps to safeguard its businesses and colleagues from COVID-19 by implementing travel restrictions, arranging work-from-home capabilities and flexible work policies, and in the second and third quarters began re-opening offices in various locations worldwide in adherence to evolving government guidelines, thereby ensuring operational continuity and the ability to service clients effectively under remote work conditions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse impact on revenue growth, primarily in discretionary businesses, which was partly mitigated through disciplined expense management by implementing restrictions on travel and other cost containment measures. As of December 31, 2020, the company has substantially integrated the Jardine Lloyd Thompson acquisition into all of its business operations, completing integration and restructuring efforts—including severance, real estate rationalization and technology investments—and exceeding initial estimated savings, thereby enhancing cost efficiency, resource allocation and performance maintenance. The company’s four market-leading businesses help clients navigate an increasingly dynamic and complex environment through risk management activities, innovative risk mitigation solutions and strategic consulting, reflecting ongoing adaptation to environmental perturbations and external pressures, while strong liquidity and capital resources, including multi-currency credit facilities, senior note issuances and targeted pension contributions, underpin its resilience strategies and long-term performance maintenance.

The rapid, global spread of COVID-19 has negatively impacted consumer demand for certain devices that incorporate our products and intellectual property, which adversely affected our business and results of operations in fiscal 2020, yet the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ability to fulfill customer orders has been minimal and workforce changes that we implemented in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 remained in effect throughout the year, illustrating our capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity. We expect the pandemic will continue to have a negative impact on QTL and QCT revenues in the near term based on reduced consumer demand, but we have not experienced, and currently do not anticipate, a material adverse impact on our or our suppliers’ ability to manufacture and test our products or to provide our products to our customers, demonstrating operational continuity under challenging conditions. We believe it is important that we remain a leader in 5G technology development, standardization, intellectual property creation and licensing of 5G technologies, and to be a leading developer and supplier of 5G integrated circuit products in order to sustain and grow our business long term, reflecting a systemic perspective, strategic agility and future orientation in confronting disruptive change. As we look forward to the next several months and beyond, we expect our research and development costs will increase primarily due to increased investment towards advancements in 5G and application processor technologies and certain other long-term initiatives, and we anticipate continued adaptation of our supply chain process to support increased demand from certain Chinese OEMs, underscoring our dynamic capabilities and resource reconfiguration in response to environmental perturbations. Our principal sources of liquidity—existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations and cash provided by our debt programs—have enabled us to manage resource deployment, maintain operational flexibility, suspend share repurchases to preserve financial flexibility and implement cost plans and workforce changes to align our capital return and investment strategies, thereby upholding system integrity and performance under internal and external variations and disturbances.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, the workforce has had and continues in most instances to spend a significant amount of time working from home, international travel has been severely curtailed and many of our productions continue to experience disruption, as are the productions of our third-party content suppliers; while we and our partners have resumed productions and related operations in many parts of the world, our ability to produce content remains affected by the pandemic and we anticipate that government actions to contain COVID-19, including any resurgences, will continue to negatively impact business activity globally. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, local or foreign authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and stockholders, recognizing that the full extent of the impact depends on numerous evolving factors that may be difficult to predict. Paid net membership additions increased as a result of the long-term trend toward streaming on-demand entertainment and COVID-19 social restrictions of home confinement, contributing to a 24% growth in revenues and a 38% increase in operating margin, driven by revenue growth coupled with cost of revenues, technology and development, and general and administrative costs growing at a slower rate than revenues. We have built our own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members, and technology and development expenses increased to support the rise in production activity and continued improvements in our streaming service. We expect to continue testing plan and price variations in each country, adapt our pricing as appropriate, and believe constant currency information is useful in analyzing underlying revenue trends. As cash provided by operating activities improved, we anticipate that future capital needs from the debt market will be more limited; our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets, and if we raise additional funds through equity or debt securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. As cash from operations grows and exceeds minimum needs, future capital allocation may include stock repurchase programs. Our primary uses of cash include acquisition, licensing and production of content, streaming delivery, marketing programs and personnel-related costs, and we expect to continue to significantly increase investments in global original content, which will impact liquidity; nevertheless, we currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources, including our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet cash needs for at least the next twelve months. Net cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to revenue growth and a decrease in cash payments for content assets over amortization, and our free cash flow metric—which reflects operating cash flow less property and equipment purchases and other assets changes—remains an important measure for meeting debt obligations, strategic acquisitions and share repurchases; in assessing liquidity relative to operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting recurring differences such as content payments over amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation, non-cash remeasurement gain/loss on euro-denominated debt and working capital variations, and our receivables from members generally settle quickly. Contractual obligations for content included $4.4 billion in current content liabilities, $2.6 billion in non-current content liabilities and $12.2 billion of commitments not yet recognized, comprising acquisition, licensing and production commitments—some for unknown future titles estimated between $1 billion and $4 billion over the next three years—and our contract obligations table excludes obligations that did not meet recognition criteria but are expected to be significant. We do not have arrangements with unconsolidated entities that expose us to material continuing risks or contingencies through structured finance or special purpose entities. In critical accounting policies, we recognize content assets net of amortization over the shorter of contractual availability periods or estimated periods of use, typically on an accelerated basis reflecting upfront viewing, and review these assets at a group level for potential impairment if events or circumstances indicate a change in expected usefulness; to date, we have not identified any such indicators. We record deferred income taxes under the asset and liability method, recognize a valuation allowance when necessary—recording a $250 million valuation allowance as of December 31, 2020 for California research and development credits not expected to be realized—and only recognize tax benefits from uncertain positions if it is more likely than not they will be sustained upon examination, measuring benefits based on the largest amount with a greater than 50% likelihood of realization, with $140 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020 that could affect future earnings.

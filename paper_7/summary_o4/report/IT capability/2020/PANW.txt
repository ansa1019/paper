We are actively monitoring, evaluating and responding to developments relating to COVID-19, which has and is expected to result in continued significant global social and business disruption, and have made changes to our operations, including instituting a global work-from-home policy beginning in March 2020 that did not incur significant disruptions in our work operations during fiscal 2020. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and make further changes to our business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, end-customers, partners, suppliers and stockholders, with our focus remaining on the safety of our employees, striving to protect the health and well-being of the communities in which we operate, and providing technology to our employees, end-customers and partners to help them do their best work while remote. Although some end-customers adopted Prisma Access as their secure work-from-home solution for the longer term, COVID-19 may curtail end-customer spending and could lead them to delay or defer purchasing decisions, and lengthen sales cycles and payment terms, which could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and overall financial performance. Our growth reflects the increased adoption of our portfolio, which consists of product, subscriptions, and support, and we believe our portfolio will enable us to benefit from recurring revenues as we continue to grow our installed end-customer base. We continue to invest in innovation and acquire businesses as we evolve and further extend the capabilities of our portfolio, as we believe that innovation and timely development of new features and products is essential to meeting the needs of our end-customers and improving our competitive position. We believe that the growth of our business and our short-term and long-term success are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to extend our technology leadership, grow our base of end-customers, expand deployment of our portfolio and support offerings within existing end-customers, and focus on end-customer satisfaction. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. While these areas present significant opportunities for us, they also pose challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results. We monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods, and we consider billings, defined as total revenue plus the change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue, to be a key metric providing visibility into our subscription and support revenue and product revenue. We monitor cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of our overall business performance and define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, equipment, and other assets, which we consider a profitability and liquidity measure that provides useful information about the amount of cash generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures. We believe that our cash flow from operations, together with existing cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future, although our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and subscription and support offerings, the costs to acquire or invest in complementary businesses and technologies, investments in our infrastructure to support the adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings, the investments in our new corporate headquarters, continuing market acceptance of our offerings and macroeconomic events such as COVID-19. We may also choose to seek additional equity or debt financing, and if we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected. We outsource most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain management operations to our EMS provider, which procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts, and we accrue for costs for manufacturing purchase commitments in excess of our forecasted demand; actual component usage and product demand may be materially different from our forecast and could be caused by factors outside of our control, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We are involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions, and these actions or other third-party claims against us may cause us to incur substantial settlement charges, which are inherently difficult to estimate and could adversely affect our results of operations. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, maintain valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized and recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process that requires significant judgment. We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators exist, using qualitative assessments, and evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, estimating fair value with significant judgment. In addition, we maintain a $400.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with an option to increase by up to $350.0 million, a $1.0 billion share repurchase program supplemented by a $1.0 billion ASR transaction completed during fiscal 2020, and issued convertible senior notes due 2023 and 2025 to bolster our financial flexibility and resilience.

Mastercard maintains organizational resilience through proactive liquidity and risk management, holding $10.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents and investments and an unused $6 billion commercial paper program supported by a $6 billion revolving credit facility to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes, settlement guarantees and business continuity. The company relies on existing liquidity, internally generated cash flows and access to capital to fund global operations, credit and settlement exposure, capital expenditures, acquisitions totaling $1.1 billion and potential obligations, while guaranteeing the settlement of customer transactions under its risk management framework. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mastercard continued to monitor pandemic effects and government interventions, adapted operational resources by reducing advertising, marketing, travel and professional fees and increasing personnel and data processing costs to support strategic initiatives, and recognized gradual recovery in key metrics. Foreign currency and credit exposures are managed with derivative contracts to hedge nonfunctional currency risk and by recording provisions for litigation and other contingencies. Disciplined capital allocation, including $4.5 billion of share repurchases and $1.6 billion of dividends, further enables the company to absorb strain, preserve performance and reconfigure resources to sustain its core payment network under nominal, extreme or exceptional external variations.

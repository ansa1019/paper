During fiscal year 2020, customer demand remained relatively strong; however, we experienced COVID-19-related production and supply chain disruptions, which impacted the timing of revenue recognition and negatively impacted our gross margin, while improvements in both our own operations and those of our suppliers are underway though risks and uncertainties related to the pandemic remain, which may negatively impact our revenue and gross margin. Over the longer term, despite risks that the broader macroeconomic environment may negatively impact demand, we believe that secular demand for semiconductors will continue to drive sustainable growth for our products and services, and that technology inflections in our industry, including 3D device scaling, multiple patterning, process flow and advanced packaging chip integration, will increase our served addressable market. We have built a strong global presence with core competencies in areas such as nanoscale applications enablement, chemistry, plasma and fluidics, advanced systems engineering and a broad range of operational disciplines; our focus on research and development—with ongoing programs in sustaining engineering, product and process development, and concept feasibility—our ability to leverage cycles of learning from our broad installed base, our collaborative partnerships with ecosystem partners and the delivery of multi-product solutions are intended to enhance the value and strategic relevance of our solutions to customers. Recognizing the importance of maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves to support ongoing investment in R&D and capital infrastructure, we believe that anticipated cash flows from operations, combined with our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $7.0 billion as of June 28, 2020, are expected to be sufficient to support operations, investments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, capital redistributions and dividends through at least the next twelve months, although uncertainty in the global economy and credit markets could impact customer demand and our ability to manage commercial relationships; if necessary, we believe we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives, subject to market conditions. In addition, our deferred revenue balance of $537 million at June 28, 2020—driven primarily by additional deferrals toward future servicing of our existing installed base and COVID-19-related production disruptions—reflects a mechanism for preserving performance under pressure, and we continuously evaluate critical accounting policies and estimates, including revenue recognition, inventory valuation, warranty provisions, income tax measurements and long-lived asset recoverability, to maintain system integrity and adaptability under both nominal and adverse conditions.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we focused on maintaining business continuity, helping our employees, customers and communities, and preparing for the future and the long-term success of our business; in 2020, we released four emergency response applications, including the Safe Workplace suite and dashboard, to help customers navigate pandemic management and the essential steps for returning employees to the workplace while supporting their health and safety; we canceled our in-person annual Knowledge user conference and replaced it with a digital event, temporarily closed most offices and encouraged employees to work remotelyâ€”changes that remain in effect and have not affected and are not expected to affect our ability to maintain operations, including financial reporting systems, internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures; while our subscription-based business model provides relatively predictable revenues, billings and earnings, we continue to invest in the development of our services, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth; to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risk, we enter into derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities; and our professional services organization is focused on strategic advisory, implementation and consulting services to accelerate platform adoption and drive customer outcomes, reflecting our commitment to operational flexibility, risk mitigation and the preservation of organizational integrity and performance under adverse conditions.

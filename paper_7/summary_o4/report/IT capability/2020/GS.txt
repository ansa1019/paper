In early 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic emerged, the firm activated its business continuity planning, managed by a central team led by the chief administrative officer and chief medical officer, with the principal objectives of safeguarding employees and ensuring continuity of business operations on behalf of clients.  The firm reported that its systems and infrastructure remained robust throughout the pandemic, enabling uninterrupted service, and that it maintained elevated communication among senior management, employees and external stakeholders, as well as ongoing vendor oversight to preserve resilience.  Throughout the year, the firm emphasized a diversified funding profile and a sufficiently liquid balance sheet, holding an average of $283 billion in global core liquid assets—unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash—while dynamically managing assets and liabilities through a balance-sheet planning process that includes limit setting, monitoring of key metrics and scenario analyses.  Contingency funding plans, which outline potential risk factors, mitigation strategies, triggers and governance procedures, were designed to pre-fund expected cash and collateral needs during stress, and to draw on secondary sources of liquidity, all subject to risk appetite limits approved by the firmwide enterprise risk and asset-liability committees.  Liquidity risk management is supplemented by firmwide and subsidiary-level stress tests—including short-term cash-flow simulations, intraday liquidity modeling, longer-term scenario analyses and recovery planning—that inform the size and composition of high-quality liquid assets and guide the issuance of secured and unsecured financing with appropriate tenor and diversity of counterparties.  Capital planning is similarly forward-looking, incorporating internally developed and supervisory severely adverse scenarios, a contingency capital plan to address potential capital deficiencies, and defined processes for dividend payments and share repurchases within regulatory buffers.  Governance of these processes rests with senior-management-level committees—including the firmwide operational risk and resilience committee, the firmwide conduct committee and the firmwide model risk control committee—which oversee operational, credit, market and model risks, ensure independent validation of risk management models, and reinforce a culture of accountability, collaboration and strategic agility under stress, thereby preserving the organization’s ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

During the COVID-19 pandemic and associated market turbulence, the firm maintained positive adjustment by prioritizing employee safety and seamless business continuity, rapidly implementing robust technology infrastructure to support remote work, instituting rigorous protocols for social distancing, testing and contact-tracing, increasing the cadence of leadership and working-level communications and leveraging videoconferencing, teleconferencing and email to keep investment committees, asset-management and corporate support functions fully operational while gradually resuming voluntary office returns under local public-health guidance. Liquidity resilience was strengthened through diversified funding sources—cash and cash equivalents, corporate treasury investments, proceeds from senior-note offerings and an expanded $2.25 billion revolving credit facility—and disciplined management of capital commitments, active monitoring of sources and uses of funds and stress testing under evolving economic and public-health conditions. The firm continuously evaluates macroeconomic and market volatility, applying dynamic scenario planning, ongoing risk assessment and mitigation measures, and adaptive reconfiguration of financing and investment strategies to preserve operational flexibility, system integrity and performance resilience through disruptive events, regulatory shifts and uncertain market environments.

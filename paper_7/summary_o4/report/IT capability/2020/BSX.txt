In response to the Covid-19 pandemicâ€™s impact on global public health and economic environments, the company implemented a series of resilience-oriented measures, including cost reduction initiatives encompassing decreases in travel, meetings, customer events, hiring, clinical programs and certain research and development projects, the imposition of a temporary four-day work week for many global employees and reduced employee and executive compensation. Manufacturing operations were adjusted with temporary closures or reduced production levels at selected sites to align build plans with current and expected demand, and business continuity plans were successfully executed, comprising the establishment of a medical advisory group for employees, the leveraging of work-from-home infrastructure to facilitate social distancing, restricted sales visits to critical cases and accelerated remote physician support capabilities while optimizing supply-chain security. As Covid-19 cases moderated and resurged, a careful, tiered site-access strategy prioritized return-to-site for employees with the greatest need, sustaining remote work elsewhere to maintain operational flexibility and health and safety. The company proactively amended financial covenants, formed a cross-functional strategic cash management team to optimize liquidity, deferred payroll tax payments, completed debt prepayments and refinancings, and executed equity offerings to preserve cash resources. Management continues to monitor uncertainties affecting operations and financial performance, evaluate asset recoverability based on revised forecasts and macroeconomic indicators, and maintain strategic focus on its long-term fundamentals and mission, striving to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning and emerge strengthened from the challenging conditions.

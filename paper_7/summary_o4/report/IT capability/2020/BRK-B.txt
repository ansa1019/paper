Berkshire Hathaway’s MD&A describes how the company’s decentralized operating model, with few centralized business functions and a senior corporate management team responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, enabled it to maintain business continuity and preserve functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the pandemic accelerated in March 2020, most businesses were negatively affected, with revenues and earnings of manufacturing, service and retailing businesses declining considerably, while essential operations—railroad, utilities and energy, insurance and certain manufacturing, wholesale distribution and service businesses—continued to operate. In response, subsidiaries implemented business continuity plans that included temporarily closing non-essential retail stores, manufacturing facilities and service centers; adopting work-from-home arrangements, staggered or reduced work schedules, enhanced cleaning and sanitation, employee health screenings, elimination of non-essential travel and face-to-face meetings; and taking economic mitigation measures such as employee furloughs, wage and salary reductions, capital spending reductions and other actions intended to preserve capital and liquidity. Certain businesses also undertook restructuring activities and aggressive resizing of operations—for example, Precision Castparts reduced its worldwide workforce by about 40% and recorded restructuring charges—to align capacity with reduced demand and to reconfigure operations for improved future performance. Across its businesses, Berkshire emphasized cost control initiatives, productivity improvements, and liquidity management—maintaining substantial cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury bills and a conservative approach that prioritizes safety over yield—to absorb strain and preserve integrity under the exceptional pressures of the pandemic and other external disruptions.

In response to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, and supply chain constraints—risks that have been amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic—we have modified numerous aspects of our logistics, transportation, supply chain, purchasing, and third-party seller processes, updated our fulfillment network to implement enhanced cleaning, physical distancing, personal protective gear, disinfectant spraying, and temperature checks, and hired over 400,000 full- and part-time employees to increase capacity, incurring approximately $11.5 billion in COVID-19-related costs during 2020 while continuing to prioritize employee and customer safety and comply with evolving standards to maintain operational continuity. We believe that our model, which enables rapid inventory turnover and a cash-generating operating cycle, alongside principal sources of liquidity—including $84.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of December 31, 2020—and our ongoing evaluation of equity and debt financings, credit facilities, lease arrangements, and debt restructurings, supports our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions. To sustain performance under pressure and secure competitive advantage, we seek to reduce variable costs per unit through increased direct sourcing, supplier discounts, and process defect reductions; mitigate shipping costs over time by achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, and negotiating better supplier terms; and maintain a lean culture to minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs. We also continue to invest efficiently in technology and content—expanding AWS and other technology infrastructure to leverage advances in processing power, data storage and analytics, wireless connectivity, artificial intelligence, and machine learning—to enhance the customer experience, improve process efficiencies at scale, and reconfigure our operational footprint to meet anticipated shipment volumes and evolving customer needs. Furthermore, by lowering prices, improving availability and reliability, offering faster delivery, increasing selection and product categories, producing original content, and earning customer trust, we aim to facilitate positive adjustment under challenging conditions and transform the company to emerge stronger from disruptive change.

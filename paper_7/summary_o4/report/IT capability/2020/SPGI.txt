Management’s discussion underscores a proactive response to external disruptions and internal resource constraints, for example noting that “we are closely monitoring the impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 on all aspects of our business” while implementing cost reductions such as “a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses from non-essential travel restrictions” to preserve operational flexibility. Under its “Powering the markets of the future” strategy, the company directs disciplined funding to organic opportunities, targeted acquisitions—such as the ESG ratings business acquired in January 2020 “to bolster our position as the premier resource for essential ESG insights”—and selective divestitures of non-core assets like its IR webhosting business and SPIAS to reconfigure its portfolio and strengthen core capabilities. S&P Global emphasizes enhancements to foundational systems through technology standardization, improved tools and processes, mature risk management and compliance practices, and an elevated cybersecurity posture to support business continuity and resiliency. Liquidity and capital resources are maintained at robust levels, with strong free cash flow, a committed credit facility, share repurchases and dividend increases to ensure financial resilience under challenging conditions. The narrative also highlights people-oriented initiatives—career mobility, retention programs, diversity and inclusion—to sustain engagement and talent depth. Across its segments, the company adapts to shifts in market demand—from increased corporate bond issuance to rising demand for data subscription, benchmark and analytic services—and aligns its operations with evolving regulatory frameworks such as the CRA, MiFID II and EU Benchmark Regulation. These measures collectively reflect the company’s capacity to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning amid adversity, and maintain performance under pressure.

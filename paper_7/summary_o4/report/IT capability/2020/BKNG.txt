Booking Holdings describes a multi-faceted organizational resilience strategy, highlighted by increasing the collaboration, cooperation and interdependency among brands and “sharing resources and technological innovations, co-developing new services and coordinating activities” to leverage scale and competitive advantage. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and related external pressures, the company implemented resilience mechanisms including raising $4.1 billion of debt, amending its revolving credit facility to ensure financial flexibility, participating in government wage support programs, suspending share repurchases, eliminating non-essential travel and events, significantly reducing marketing spend, instituting a company-wide hiring freeze, undertaking restructuring and workforce reductions to optimize efficiency and reduce costs (projected to yield $370 million of annualized savings), and divesting non-core investments. Leadership measures included voluntary salary reductions by the chief executive officer, senior managers and non-employee directors, reflecting adaptive governance and crisis agency. The firm also expanded its merchant transaction processing capabilities, enhancing operational continuity, payment flexibility and resource reconfiguration, while increasing provisions for expected credit losses to mitigate counterparty risk from partner insolvencies. To manage risk and preserve system integrity under extreme conditions, Booking Holdings monitors the financial health of travel-service and restaurant partners, uses derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency fluctuations, and adjusts marketing investment dynamically based on margin and revenue trade-offs. The company’s strategic focus on a “connected trip” reflects a systemic perspective and future orientation aimed at maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions by integrating multiple travel elements, fostering service innovation, and pursuing resilience through resource sharing, technology development and coordinated brand activities. This trajectory model of resilience draws attention to partial maintenance of integrity and performance; though severe contractions in gross bookings and revenues have occurred, these resilience strategies are designed to support recovery, preserve organizational health and ensure operational flexibility and survival in a turbulent business environment.

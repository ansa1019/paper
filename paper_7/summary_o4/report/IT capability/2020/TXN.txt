In our Management’s Discussion and Analysis overview, we emphasize investments aimed at long-term strengthening and leveraging of our four sustainable competitive advantages—a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology that provides lower costs and greater control of our supply chain, a broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products that offers more value for our investments and better insight into customer needs, market channel reach that drives opportunity across design projects, and product, market and customer diversity that reduces single-point dependency and extends return horizons—complemented by disciplined capital allocation and a relentless pursuit of efficiency to maximize free cash flow per share growth and sustain performance under pressure. We continue to monitor and assess economic uncertainty and the dynamic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, supply chain and customer demand, maintaining a long-standing business continuity plan for unforeseeable situations. Over the past several years, we have invested in building inventory and expanding our global, internally owned manufacturing footprint, which has given us operational flexibility—such as the ability to build products across multiple manufacturing sites—and has helped minimize disruptions. Our primary sources of liquidity—cash flow from operations, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and a variable-rate revolving credit facility supporting commercial paper issuance—together with detailed operating plans, underscore our ability to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments and other business requirements for at least the next twelve months.

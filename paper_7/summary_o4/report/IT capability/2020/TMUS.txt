In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as a critical communications infrastructure provider, we focused on providing crucial connectivity to customers and impacted communities while ensuring the safety and well-being of employees, supplementing pay, commissions, and paid time off, implementing remote working arrangements, encouraging social distancing and heightened sanitation. We committed to the FCC’s Keep Americans Connected pledge by waiving late fees and not terminating residential or small business service, and provided unlimited high-speed smartphone data, mobile hotspot additions, free data for lifeline and digital learning programs, and free international calling to ensure operational continuity. To address pandemic-driven disruptions in customer payment and purchasing behavior, we worked with customers to maintain service and avoid hardship, offered COVID-safe virtual selling and curbside pickup, and partnered with spectrum holders and the FCC to deploy additional 600 MHz capacity, while continuing to expand and keep fully operational our nationwide 5G network. Concurrently, following our merger with Sprint, we structured integration and restructuring initiatives—including network decommissioning, retail unification, contract rationalization, severance, and IT and back-office efficiencies—to eliminate redundancies, realize cost synergies, and reconfigure operations. We maintain contingency arrangements for off-balance sheet receivables sales and vendor financing, regularly review projections for financial and operating performance, competitive landscape, and economic conditions, and expect our principal funding sources to satisfy liquidity requirements for capital expenditures on spectrum integration and nationwide network build-out. We have entered into multi-year MVNO agreements to provide network services post-divestiture and amended credit facilities, and we will continue to monitor external pressures, adjusting actions as needed to maintain system integrity, preserve performance, and support growth under challenging conditions.

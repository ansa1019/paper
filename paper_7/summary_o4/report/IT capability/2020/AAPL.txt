In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused unprecedented volatility and disruption in financial markets, many of the company’s retail stores and channel-partner points of sale were temporarily closed, the vast majority of its employees transitioned to remote work, and the company has since reopened certain offices and retail locations subject to public health and safety restrictions while continuing to work toward the safe reopening of remaining sites under local regulations. The company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements will be sufficient to satisfy working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements over the next twelve months, and its investment policy—requiring investment-grade securities and limiting credit exposure to any one issuer—is designed to minimize the potential risk of principal loss. During 2020, cash generated by operating activities of $80.7 billion reflected net income, non-cash adjustments and changes in operating assets and liabilities; cash used in investing activities of $4.3 billion consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment acquisitions and business acquisitions, partially offset by net proceeds from marketable securities; and cash used in financing activities of $86.8 billion was driven by common stock repurchases, dividends and debt repayments, partially offset by net proceeds from debt issuances. The company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes for general corporate purposes, maintains maturities generally less than nine months and may enter repurchase agreements as additional liquidity arrangements, and it enters into interest rate and foreign currency swaps to manage related risks. Its long-term lease arrangements for retail, corporate, manufacturing and data center facilities typically have original terms not exceeding ten years and generally contain multi-year renewal options to support operational flexibility. Manufacturing purchase obligations are based on demand information supplied by the company—typically covering up to 150 days—and other noncancelable purchase obligations include commitments to acquire capital assets, tooling, manufacturing process equipment, and services such as advertising, licensing, R&D and telecommunications. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various assumptions to determine the recoverability of manufacturing-related assets, estimate inventory purchase-commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes and legal contingencies, with senior management review alongside the audit and finance committee, and acknowledges that actual results may differ materially. Revenue recognition for hardware, bundled software, product-related services and unspecified future software upgrades involves allocation based on estimated stand-alone selling prices and straight-line deferral over the periods services are provided, reflecting management judgment that may change as facts and circumstances evolve. These measures collectively illustrate the company’s capacity to absorb strain, manage resource allocation, mitigate risks, adapt operational practices and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions.

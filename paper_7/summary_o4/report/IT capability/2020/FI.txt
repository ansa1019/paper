In light of the academic definition of organizational resilience as the ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adversity, the company has implemented a range of measures to protect employee health and safety while maintaining business continuity during the COVID-19 pandemic, including remote work, elimination of non-essential travel and visitors, enhanced facility disinfection, provision of personal protective equipment, expanded paid leave, critical-infrastructure pay and the Fiserv Cares program. Management continues to monitor and assess pandemic developments to implement appropriate actions to minimize operational risk and adapt safety policies as required by government authorities or business needs. The firm’s active portfolio management and disciplined capital allocation, including strategic acquisitions, divestitures and the realignment of reportable segments following the First Data acquisition, serve to reconfigure resources toward compelling strategic needs, support integration value and realize revenue and cost synergies under challenging market conditions. Maintaining sufficient liquidity and access to external financing—through a $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, term loan commitments and various senior notes offerings—as well as regular communication with banks to ensure debt service capability, underpins the organization’s ability to absorb external pressures and preserve its performance. Risk management practices, including interest rate and currency hedges and guaranteed credit arrangements with joint ventures, contribute to operational flexibility and system resilience. Proactive cost management actions—such as limiting hiring, third-party spending, temporarily suspending certain employee benefits, deferring capital expenditures and deferring share repurchases—demonstrate adaptive strategies to mitigate the impact of economic volatility. These measures, together with a systemic perspective on sustaining organizational health, preserving operational continuity and transforming the business to emerge stronger, reflect the company’s multifaceted approach to responding effectively to environmental disruptions and sustaining performance under pressure.

Following the closing of the Allergan acquisition, AbbVie implemented an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization, expected to realize more than $2 billion of annual cost synergies over three years, and continues to closely manage manufacturing and supply-chain resources around the world to help ensure that patients receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines. The company’s strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, maximizing the benefits of the Allergan acquisition, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term, and remains committed to driving continued expansion of operating margins through leverage from revenue growth, realization of expense synergies, productivity initiatives in supply-chain and ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, AbbVie partnered with global authorities to support experimental use of its assets for treatment studies, donated $35 million to increase healthcare capacity and supplies, and monitored clinical-trial sites locally to protect study participants, staff and employees, while assessing the uncertain impact on new patient starts and adjusting operations accordingly. The company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations through cash on hand, future cash flows or by issuing additional debt, leveraging a $4 billion revolving credit facility and commercial paper programs while maintaining covenant compliance and credit ratings. AbbVie monitors economic conditions, customer creditworthiness and government regulations, establishes allowances for credit losses, uses internal and external data to estimate inventory levels and rebate processing lag times for chargebacks, and records adjustments when trends or legislation change. Contractual obligations, including long-term debt, lease payments and other purchase commitments, are periodically evaluated, while loss contingency provisions for legal disputes are recorded at management’s best estimate and adjusted as events unfold. The company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or when events indicate potential impairment, and revalues contingent consideration liabilities at fair value each reporting date based on probabilities of achieving development, regulatory and commercial milestones. AbbVie enters into R&D collaborations with milestone payments contingent upon achievement of specified outcomes and engages outside actuaries to calculate defined-benefit obligations and costs using actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, expected long-term rates of return and healthcare cost trend rates.

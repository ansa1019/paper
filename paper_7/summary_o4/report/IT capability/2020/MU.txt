Events surrounding the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak have resulted in a reduction in economic activity across the globe, which has affected demand for certain of our products. While all our global sites are currently operating with close to full staff and at normal capacity levels, our facilities could be required to temporarily curtail production levels or temporarily cease operations based on government mandates and we may be required to, or deem it to be in the best interest of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stakeholders, to alter our business operations in order to maintain a healthy and safe environment. Our efforts to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak include implementing health screenings, physical distancing, team separation protocols, thermal scanning, mandatory face coverings, prohibiting visitors, significantly decreasing business travel, and generally requiring team members to work from home where possible; shifting supply from markets which have experienced declines in demand to markets that have experienced demand increases; evaluating our supply chain, communicating with our suppliers to identify supply gaps, adding alternative suppliers, and increasing our on-hand inventory; adding assembly and test capacity to provide redundant manufacturing capability through our captive operations and external partners; evaluating construction projects globally and enacting protocols to enhance safety; developing strategies and implementing measures to respond to a variety of potential economic scenarios, such as limitations on new hiring, business travel, and reductions of discretionary spending; and working with government authorities to monitor and adjust our operations in accordance with requirements, regulations, industry standards, and best practices to help safeguard our personnel while allowing us to safely continue operations. We believe these actions are appropriate and prudent to safeguard our team members, contractors, suppliers, customers, and communities, while allowing us to safely continue operations, but we cannot predict how the steps we, our team members, government entities, suppliers, or customers take in response to the COVID-19 outbreak will ultimately impact our business, outlook, or results of operations. We also cannot predict the duration of BIS trade restrictions that currently prevent us from shipping products to Huawei and may not be able to replace the lost revenue opportunities associated with such restrictions. We expect underutilization costs at MTU to gradually decline through 2021 as we redeploy equipment and continue to right-size our capacity. We are continuously evaluating alternatives for efficiently funding our capital expenditures and ongoing operations and expect our cash and investments, cash flows from operations, and available financing—such as the $2.50 billion available under our revolving credit facility—to be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through the next 12 months. To develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities and equipment, and research and development, for which we estimate capital expenditures in 2021, net of partner contributions, of approximately $9 billion, focused on technology transitions and product enablement.

During the COVID-19 environment the Company’s financial condition and operating results remained strong and continued to improve in the first quarter of 2021 as minimal impacts were experienced on its operations and maintenance portfolio fundamentals, owing to the high quality and strategic location of its real estate assets, diversified customer base and favorable logistics market conditions. Rent collections proved resilient, with customer‐requested concessions deferred to later periods representing less than 1 percent of annualized revenue and 98 percent of those deferrals collected by January 25, 2021, while bad debt continued to trend below initial expectations. Leasing activity remained robust throughout 2020, with 150 million square feet of new leases commenced at an average term of 66 months and rent changes of 21.3 percent for the year, and the Company restarted the majority of its speculative development projects by the fourth quarter, demonstrating its capacity to reconstitute and reconfigure development trajectories under uncertainty. Business continuity and communication plans, supported by technology infrastructure, enabled all functions of the business to operate smoothly with remote‐work protocols, no layoffs and extended financial assistance to employees in need, while local property and leasing teams maintained assets and collaborated with customers under established safety measures. Through its Space for Good program and a combined $6 million pledge by the Prologis Foundation to COVID-19 relief and racial equality causes, the Company reinforced its social capital and stakeholder engagement in crisis response. Capital deployment and disposition activities proceeded uninterrupted and are expected to accelerate in 2021, supported by $4.8 billion of available liquidity, extended debt maturities to a weighted average of 10 years with a 1.9 percent effective interest rate, and anticipated cash flows from operations, equity commitments in co-investment ventures and borrowing capacity under credit facilities, thereby preserving operational flexibility, resource allocation and system integrity under challenging and evolving conditions.

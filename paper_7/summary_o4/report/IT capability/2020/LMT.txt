Lockheed Martin’s actions during 2020 reflect organizational resilience as defined by scholars as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” (Vogus & Sutcliffe, 2007), absorbing strain and preserving or improving functioning despite adversity. Operating in an environment characterized by global security complexity and economic pressures, the company has focused on program execution and on improving the quality and predictability of its products and services, while pursuing disciplined portfolio shaping through independent research and development, selective acquisitions, divestitures and internal realignment to meet current and future customer needs. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Lockheed Martin took extensive measures to protect the health and safety of its employees, including personal protective equipment, minimum staffing, social distancing, more frequent workspace sanitization, alternate work schedules and a flexible teleworking policy; it worked closely with customers and suppliers to minimize disruptions, accelerated payments to impacted suppliers (with an emphasis on small businesses), and sustained essential operations as a designated critical infrastructure workforce despite production rate adjustments and staffing fluctuations caused by supplier delays and site restrictions. These operational flexibility initiatives, together with proactive supply chain monitoring, favorable contract award timing, strong operational performance, lower travel and overhead expenditures and increased progress payment rates, have partially mitigated pandemic-related impacts on program execution and financial results. Concurrently, the company has maintained a balanced cash deployment strategy—investing in capital projects, innovation, technology and people, managing debt, pension obligations and liquidity, and preserving access to credit markets and letters of credit—to ensure business continuity and support future growth. Lockheed Martin’s contract accounting and risk management processes identify and monitor technical, schedule and cost risks at inception and throughout performance, enabling recovery of actual costs plus reasonable margins and highlighting the ability to adapt to internal or external pressures, maintain integrity, manage environmental remediation under U.S. Government regulations, and sustain program delivery and financial stability under varying conditions.

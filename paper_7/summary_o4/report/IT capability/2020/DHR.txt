Danaher’s geographic and industry diversity, as well as the range of its products, software and services, help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results. The company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future. Danaher is making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources in order to be responsive to customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of its operations. The company continues to actively monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and has taken and intends to continue taking steps to identify and mitigate the adverse impacts on, and risks to, its business (including its employees, customers, business partners, manufacturing capabilities and capacity, and supply and distribution channels) posed by the spread of COVID-19 and the governmental and community responses thereto. Danaher’s businesses have activated their business continuity plans in response to the pandemic, including taking steps in an effort to help keep the workforce healthy and safe, and are assessing and updating those plans on an ongoing basis. As a result of COVID-19, the company’s businesses have modified certain of their business practices (including employee travel, work locations and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and the company expects to take such further actions as may be required by government authorities or as determined to be in the best interests of employees, customers and other business partners. The company has developed return-to-work protocols designed to help ensure the health and safety of its employees, customers and business partners, for its businesses to apply as and when return-to-work is legally permissible and deemed appropriate. Danaher is working with its suppliers to understand existing and potential future negative impacts to its supply chain and take actions in an effort to mitigate such impacts and is deploying its capabilities, expertise and scale to address the critical health needs related to COVID-19. The acquisition of Cytiva has provided and is expected to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the life sciences segment by expanding geographic and product line diversity, including new product and service offerings that complement current biologics workflow solutions. Operating cash flows from continuing operations can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, restructuring activities and productivity improvement initiatives, pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows. The aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively the company manages the cash conversion cycle, which can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period. Management assesses the company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities and believes that its operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow continued investment in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and investments, interest and debt servicing, restructuring and capital-structure management, while continuing to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on its liquidity and capital resources and taking actions intended to mitigate adverse impacts.

Nvidia’s management acknowledged that its products are manufactured based on long lead‐time forecasts of future customer demand, which can result in significant mismatches between supply and demand, product shortages or excess inventory, and increased uncertainty in demand forecasting; to mitigate these risks, the company may build inventory for anticipated growth, place non‐cancellable orders well in advance, pay premiums or provide deposits to secure scarce capacity and components, and adjust production plans in light of competitor actions, new product transitions, market volatility (including cryptocurrency fluctuations) and channel partner decisions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Nvidia rapidly transitioned most employees to remote work, suspended business travel and reallocated resources to support accelerated demand in gaming, data center and professional visualization platforms, while closely monitoring global supply-chain disruptions, logistical constraints and shifting consumer behavior to preserve operational continuity and recognize that ongoing disruptions may have a material net negative impact on its business. Inventory provisions for excess or obsolete stock reflect changes in economic and market conditions, technological obsolescence, order cancellations or shifts in customer requirements, and Nvidia continuously evaluates its third-party manufacturing commitments, macroeconomic trends and inventory levels to adjust to sudden decreases in demand and minimize impairment. On the liquidity front, the company maintains a diversified portfolio of highly rated fixed-income securities with maturity limits, held $11.56 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of January 31, 2021, and believes these resources, together with strong operating cash flows and short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, debt repayments, strategic acquisitions (including the pending Arm transaction) and other obligations for at least the next twelve months; Nvidia continuously evaluates its liquidity position, access to external capital and planned capital investments of approximately $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2022 to ensure it can adapt to evolving conditions, maintain performance and emerge stronger from adversity.

During the pandemic, management rapidly adapted its integrated rail network to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions by transforming operations to protect employee and community health, implementing enhanced safety procedures and multi-faceted risk assessments per CDC guidelines, and shifting demand-driven resource allocations to accommodate significant freight volume swings. Transportation plan modifications eliminated switches, improved terminal processes, extended sidings for longer trains, and optimized resource utilization, driving an 8% improvement in freight car terminal dwell, a 6% increase in freight car velocity, a 14% gain in locomotive productivity and an all-time record 59.9% operating ratio, while targeted capital investments hardened infrastructure and replaced aging assets to bolster system resilience. The company also preserved liquidity and financial flexibility by generating $8.5 billion of operating cash flow, maintaining credit facilities, pausing and resuming share repurchases, and adhering to debt covenants, and plans a $2.9 billion capital plan in 2021 to continue enhancing reliability, reducing variability, and sustaining service continuity across its network.

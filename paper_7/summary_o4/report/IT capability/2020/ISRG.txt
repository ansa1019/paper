During 2020, the company experienced significant COVID-19 pandemic–induced variability in procedure volumes and system placements and responded by focusing on the health and safety of patients, customers, communities and employees, implementing continuous updates to health and safety policies and processes, and supporting customers’ clinical, operational and economic priorities to ensure continuity of supply and preserve operational functionality under adverse conditions. Customers deferred decisions to purchase or lease systems, and the company deployed service fee credits, deferred lease payments and extended payment terms as risk mitigation measures while monitoring associated credit risks and potential defaults. The company leverages its connected installed base, system logs, shipment and utilization metrics, and other decision-support information to assess performance under pressure, plan and forecast future resource requirements, and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Investments in an extended use program, successive product generations, telepresence-based training and optimized manufacturing and supply chain processes illustrate resource reconfiguration, service innovation and adaptation strategies designed to absorb strain and improve performance. Alternative sales-type, operating lease and usage-based arrangements offer customers operational flexibility and align access to systems with evolving needs, while exposure to usage shortfalls and contractual exits is managed through ongoing monitoring and contingency planning. The company actively engages with regulatory authorities to secure clearances, meets evolving compliance standards, and conducts recalls and corrections with formal notifications and field interventions to protect system integrity. By modeling patient value and total treatment economics to guide strategic initiatives, the company demonstrates dynamic capabilities, systemic perspective and organizational resilience—defined as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions—to transform itself and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

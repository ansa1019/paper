In 2020, amid a once-in-a-generation pandemic, PepsiCo confronted internal and external pressures—including a global health crisis, climate volatility, social justice demands and structural market shifts—by executing health and safety protocols, comprehensive business continuity and crisis management plans to maintain employee well-being and operational performance. Management prioritized securing supply-chain integrity and ensuring continuity in manufacturing, distribution and sales, while accelerating digital and e-commerce capabilities and reimagining marketing to adapt to changed consumer behaviors. Concurrently, the company launched a multi-year productivity plan to simplify, harmonize and automate processes; optimize its manufacturing and supply-chain footprint; deploy a highly agile and flexible end-to-end value chain; and reconfigure organizational structures to drive holistic cost management, resource allocation and data-driven decision-making. PepsiCo’s integrated risk management framework, overseen by its board and cross-functional risk committees, systematically identifies, assesses, prioritizes and monitors strategic, financial, operational, compliance, safety and reputational risks and deploys controls, hedging strategies and inter-organizational collaboration to mitigate commodity, foreign exchange and interest-rate volatility. Underpinning these efforts are investments in purpose-aligned practices—planet-positive initiatives, agricultural resiliency, human capital diversification and community engagement—designed to sustain positive adjustment, preserve organizational health and reinforce long-term sustainable growth in the face of disruptive change.

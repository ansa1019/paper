In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company concentrated on maintaining a reliable supply of medicines, reducing strain on healthcare systems, developing treatments, protecting employee health and safety, supporting communities, and ensuring affordability and access—particularly for insulin—while pausing and subsequently resuming new clinical trial starts to manage medical system capacity and temporarily halting, then reinstating, in-person interactions with healthcare providers under safety and compliance guidance and increasing virtual engagement to enhance operational flexibility. The company reports that it largely maintained normal operations in 2020, underscoring continuity in manufacturing, global supply chain, and distribution systems, though it acknowledges potential future adverse impacts should the pandemic persist. Liquidity and financial resilience are supported by strong operating cash flows, access to committed bank credit facilities and debt markets, disciplined management of research and development spending across a diversified pipeline—where a delay or termination of any single project does not significantly alter total R&D investment—and a controlled risk management program utilizing derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate and currency exchange volatility. The company also executed worldwide cost-structure actions, recognized restructuring charges to preserve resources, maintained dividend distributions for the 135th consecutive year, and conducted targeted share repurchases while funding strategic acquisitions and integrations through a balanced use of cash, commercial paper, and debt issuance. These disclosures illustrate a multifaceted approach to preserve organizational integrity and performance under internal and external pressures through proactive risk assessment, resource reconfiguration, crisis response measures, and strategic initiatives aimed at sustaining business continuity and emergent strength in the face of adversity.

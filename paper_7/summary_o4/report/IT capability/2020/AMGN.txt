In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Amgen carefully monitored its impact on global operations, taking appropriate steps to minimize risk to employees, with a significant portion working remotely, and such arrangements not significantly affecting its ability to maintain critical business operations or supply of medicines. The company’s strategy includes integrated activities intended to maintain and strengthen its competitive position, and during 2020 it advanced its innovative pipeline, successfully integrated Otezla® into its inflammation portfolio, expanded internationally and provided uninterrupted supply of medicines globally through the pandemic while maintaining a strategic and disciplined approach to capital allocation and advancing environmental, social and governance efforts. Amgen continuously monitors its ability for clinical study enrollment on an institution-by-institution basis, pausing when uncertainty arises to ensure safety and data integrity, and its R&D organization supports pandemic responses by producing therapeutic antibodies, joining a public-private coordinated research partnership and participating in platform studies. Believing that existing funds, cash from operations and financing sources are adequate, Amgen invests in its business while returning capital to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases, manages liquidity with an investment policy to maintain safety of principal and prudent risk levels, employs interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps designated as fair value and cash flow hedges, maintains an amended $2.5 billion syndicated revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop, and has a shelf registration statement to access debt and equity markets. Human capital resource management is directed at attracting, motivating and retaining talent with compensation, benefits and development programs designed to encourage performance, accountability and adherence to company values, and a diverse and inclusive culture is believed to foster innovation and enhance patient service. Amgen also sets and meets environmental sustainability targets, reducing fleet and facility carbon output, water consumption and waste disposal while growing revenues and production capacity. Throughout the year, the company managed competitive pressures from biosimilars and generics, fluctuations in physician-patient interactions and regulatory scrutiny, deploying resources to R&D, manufacturing and risk mitigation to preserve operating continuity, adaptability and overall firm performance under challenging conditions.

In 2020, our financial performance remained strong despite the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting the solid underlying fundamentals of our business and our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions. We continued to expand and strengthen our commercial portfolio and clinical pipeline across multiple therapeutic areas through strategic acquisitions (including Forty Seven, Immunomedics and Myr GmbH) and licensing and collaboration agreements, thereby reallocating resources to maintain operational flexibility, service innovation and future growth. We adapted clinical and manufacturing operations to address surges in Veklury demand, paused or postponed certain trials and deployed foreign currency hedges to mitigate volatility. Our strategic priorities for 2021 encompass expanding internal and external innovation, strengthening portfolio decision-making, increasing patient access and evolving our culture, with a disciplined focus on capital allocation, expense management and stakeholder engagement. We assess risks and resource needs across our HIV, viral hepatitis and oncology franchises, continually reconfigure R&D investments based on scientific data, probability of success, market potential and available human and capital resources, and maintain our leadership in antiviral medications. Our capital resources, supplemented by operating cash flows, acquisitions, debt offerings, credit facilities and share repurchase and dividend programs, provide the financial resilience required to navigate uncertainties including pandemic dynamics, payer pressures, loss of exclusivity and macroeconomic fluctuations. We regularly assess and update our estimates and valuations (including for government rebates and IPR&D assets) and test intangible and goodwill carrying values for impairment to preserve system integrity and performance. Our commitment to advancing innovative medicines in areas of unmet need, promoting racial equity, investing in our people and infrastructure, and rigorous risk management enables us to maintain continuity of operations, recover from disruptions and pursue transformative therapies to emerge stronger from adverse conditions.

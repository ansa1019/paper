Throughout fiscal 2020 our operations embodied the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions by rapidly adapting to the COVID-19 pandemic, shifting approximately 95 percent of our global workforce to remote work, suspending substantially all business travel and developing a phased return-to-office plan guided by employee safety and client requirements to ensure continuity of sales and service delivery. We proactively planned and managed the size and composition of our workforce to align with evolving client demand—evaluating voluntary attrition, adjusting hiring levels, deploying involuntary terminations when necessary and calibrating compensation across skill sets and geographies—while striving to adjust pricing and the mix of resources to protect margins despite external pressures. We sustained functioning and financial performance by assisting clients with digital transformations, cloud enablement and security-related services as some industries reprioritized or delayed work and others accelerated investments, thereby absorbing strain and preserving our performance. To mitigate financial and operational risks and preserve organizational integrity, we manage foreign currency volatility through customer contract provisions and hedging programs, maintain liquidity via cash flows from operations, cash reserves and debt capacity under credit facilities, and allocate capital—including acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases—in response to market conditions. Our contractual commitments and indemnification arrangements further underwrite our capacity to respond to contingencies, while continuous review of working capital, investment needs and resource deployment underpins our systemic resilience and adaptive capability amid environmental perturbations.

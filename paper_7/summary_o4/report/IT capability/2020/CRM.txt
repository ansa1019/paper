In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been guided by our core values of trust, customer success, innovation and equality and took actions focused on maintaining business continuity, supporting our employees, helping our customers and communities and preparing for the future and the long-term success of our business. Our income from operations benefited from our global work-from-home policy and limited business travel, while we recorded approximately $216 million of impairments to assets associated with real estate leases in select locations we have decided to exit and continue to evaluate our office space needs. We have in the past implemented strategic realignments to position our company for future growth and will continue to do so, redirecting resources from areas that no longer align with our business priorities into key growth and strategic areas and increasing investments in our go-to-market and product efforts, which resulted in incremental operating expenses and lower than expected operating cash flows for fiscal 2021. In response to COVID-19, we offered temporary financial flexibility to some customers and changed billing frequencies for other customers, which delayed payments to periods later than expected but preserved contractual commitments. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services, data center capacity and professional services headcount to scale with our customers, continuously evolve our security measures and facilitate the adoption of our service offerings. Authoritiesâ€™ preventative measures have caused business slowdowns and shutdowns that have impacted and may continue to impact our ability to address cybersecurity incidents, develop and support products and services and access data centers, underscoring the importance of risk mitigation, operational flexibility and preparedness for uncertain external pressures. We regularly evaluate acquisitions and investment opportunities to expand our service offerings and nurture the overall ecosystem for our offerings, and believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided by operating activities, unbilled amounts related to contracted non-cancelable subscription agreements and borrowing capacity under our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months while funding the pending acquisition of Slack. Additionally, during fiscal 2021 our pandemic response included launching Work.com, Work.com for Schools and Vaccine Cloud to help customers reopen safely and mobilizing to address personal protective equipment shortages, reflecting our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity.

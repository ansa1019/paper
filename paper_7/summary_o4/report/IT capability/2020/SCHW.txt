Throughout 2020, despite the unprecedented combination of personal and macroeconomic challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, volatile equity markets, and social and political turmoil, the company executed on key strategic initiatives to drive scale, monetization, and segmentation, maintained a disciplined approach to capital management that sustained significant balance-sheet growth, and progressed in the integration of acquisitions over an 18- to 36-month horizon to reconstitute and reconfigure its strategic trajectory.  Schwab’s enterprise risk management framework, approved by the board’s risk committee and overseen by a global risk committee with functional sub-committees, establishes risk appetite metrics and tolerance levels across operational, compliance, credit, market, and liquidity risks, and relies on detailed policies, procedures, and internal controls—including backup and recovery infrastructure, routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans, incident management, information security monitoring and response, fraud prevention controls, third-party risk standards, model governance, and incentive compensation risk assessment—to identify, measure, monitor, and mitigate risks that could impair financial or reputational strength.  To manage financial risk, the company employs credit-limit reviews and collateral requirements for lending and clearing activities, interest-rate-risk simulations of net interest revenue and economic value of equity under various rate scenarios, regular liquidity stress testing with contingency funding plans and diversified funding sources, compliance with a reduced liquidity coverage ratio, and ongoing capital stress testing supported by a comprehensive capital contingency plan, all designed to preserve system integrity and performance under internal or external variations and to emerge stronger from disruptive events.

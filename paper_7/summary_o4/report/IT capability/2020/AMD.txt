Throughout 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, AMD demonstrated organizational resilience by sustaining operations with minimal financial disruption through hybrid on-site and remote work arrangements, health and safety measures, and proactive support for employee productivity. The company monitored customer demand signals and dynamically adjusted its supply chain requirements and product schedules to accommodate geographic and market shifts and remote working requirements. It delivered strong financial results—net revenue increased 45 percent to $9.8 billion, operating income more than doubled, and it generated $1.1 billion of operating cash flow—while maintaining $2.3 billion in liquid resources supplemented by a revolving credit facility to ensure liquidity and fund capital investments. AMD continued executing its long-term growth strategy by accelerating its technical, operational and financial foundation, investing in research and development and marketing, expanding its 7 nanometer processor and graphics portfolio, and announcing the intended acquisition of Xilinx to bolster high-performance computing capabilities. Management preserved organizational flexibility by managing contractual obligations—including term debt, operating leases and purchase commitments—and by continually evaluating critical accounting estimates to maintain system integrity and performance under evolving external pressures.

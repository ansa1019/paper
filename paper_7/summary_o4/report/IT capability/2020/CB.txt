Chubb’s management discussion and analysis describes a multifaceted approach to sustaining operations and preserving performance under adverse conditions by leveraging product and geographic diversification, a profit-center structure that empowers decentralized underwriting decisions and tailored product creation, and disciplined risk-selection criteria to ensure underwriting returns adequately compensate for accepted risk. The company actively monitors and manages catastrophe exposures worldwide, employing modeled probable-maximum-loss assessments to set retention limits, purchasing layered reinsurance protection, and regularly reviewing and adjusting program structures in light of changing pricing, exposures, and risk tolerance. Risk mitigation extends across other lines—crop, political, and variable annuity reinsurance—through geographic diversification, liability limits, quota-share and stop-loss reinsurance, derivative contracts, structural policy provisions, and hedging strategies designed to offset both long-term economic losses and earnings volatility. Liquidity and capital resilience are maintained by matching asset durations to liability profiles, holding highly liquid investments and cash, accessing repurchase agreements and syndicated credit facilities, and preserving financial flexibility via an SEC shelf registration for debt and equity issuance. Finally, the firm’s capital management tools—flexible dividend policy, share repurchases, and retained earnings—enable resource allocation and strategic adaptation, thereby supporting continuity, stability, and the capacity to respond effectively to unexpected challenges and market disruptions.

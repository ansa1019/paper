The company reported that “COVID-19 materially impacted our 2020 results of operations,” yet its cable communications “distribution network performed well under the stress of increased traffic and peak usage,” and it implemented programs “to keep our customers connected” by compensating frontline personnel, waiving fees, extending payment options and providing free Internet services through its Internet Essentials offer to maintain continuity under adversity. To bolster resilience, Comcast “repaid $18.8 billion and issued $18.6 billion of long-term debt,” resulting in “a reduction in the weighted-average cost of debt” and “provides additional liquidity given the risks associated with the economic conditions caused by COVID-19,” while also “taking actions to conservatively manage cash through reductions in costs and capital expenditures.” Management affirmed that “existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, available borrowings under our existing credit facilities and our ability to obtain future external financing will be sufficient to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements,” and noted that it “met” its leverage covenant “by a significant margin.” The company adopted cost-savings initiatives, including severance-related realignments, paused certain capital projects such as the Orlando theme park expansion and prioritized investments in “scalable infrastructure,” network capacity and digital platforms such as xFi-enabled gateways, X1, cloud DVR, Peacock and Sky Q to adapt to evolving customer needs. Throughout the year, management conducted qualitative impairment assessments of goodwill and franchise rights—concluding no impairment was necessary—and evaluated recoverability of film and television costs through individual title impairment testing, demonstrating ongoing risk assessment and asset-integrity monitoring under internal and external variations. These measures of resource reconfiguration, innovation investment, performance maintenance, and flexible operational and financial management collectively illustrate the maintenance of integrity and performance in the face of extreme and unexpected adversity.

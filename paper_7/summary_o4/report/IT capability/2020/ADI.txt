The Company reports that government authorities’ measures to contain COVID-19—including travel bans, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns—have disrupted workforce, operations and manufacturing facilities worldwide, prompting modifications to business practices such as restricting employee travel, changing work locations and canceling physical meetings, and drawing upon long-term contingency planning to stabilize manufacturing operations and the supply chain at normal levels, even as the situation remains dynamic and the full impact and duration of the pandemic on economic and operating conditions cannot presently be quantified. The Company believes that its existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, transaction costs and dividend payments for at least the next twelve months, and manages worldwide cash requirements by reviewing subsidiary cash balances, maintaining cash and equivalents with high-quality counterparties, diversifying investments to minimize credit risk and complying with covenants under a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility designed to support working capital, acquisitions and other corporate purposes. Efforts to balance manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels are employed to support forecasted sales and accommodate demand variations, while the Company’s continued commitment to R&D is viewed as critical to maintain product leadership and to provide innovative offerings. Monitoring global macroeconomic conditions and assessing opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency have led to restructuring initiatives—including workforce repositioning and consolidation of acquired manufacturing facilities—to align expenses with revenues and achieve annualized savings, and derivative instruments are employed to hedge interest rate and foreign currency exposures, with sensitivity analyses and credit counterparty monitoring performed to mitigate financial market risks. The Company temporarily suspended its share repurchase program in March 2020 due to the global macroeconomic environment and acquisition plans, subsequently reinstating the program in November 2020 with future repurchases to be determined based on financial position, results of operations, outlook and liquidity. Collectively, these strategic measures—underpinned by resource allocation, adaptability of operations, risk management and strategic foresight—support the Company’s ability to absorb strain, preserve continuity and maintain performance and financial resilience under challenging conditions.

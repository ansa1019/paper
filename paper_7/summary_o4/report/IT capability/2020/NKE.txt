In response to the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) and the resulting travel restrictions, store closures and reduced operating hours in virtually all regions, Nike undertook a range of adaptive measures to preserve functioning and emerge stronger from these extreme conditions.  These included modifying buying plans and canceling certain pre-COVID-19 factory purchases, shifting product offer dates to meet near-term demand, reallocating available inventory into its digital channel and increasing digital fulfillment capacity to manage future inventory growth and ensure a return to normalized levels, as well as investing in targeted promotions and markdowns to accelerate liquidation of excess inventory while protecting the long-term health of its product franchises.  To mitigate liquidity risk and maintain business continuity, the company enhanced its liquidity position through the issuance of $6 billion in senior unsecured notes, the temporary suspension of its share repurchase program and the establishment of a new $2 billion committed credit facility.  Throughout the disruption, Nike’s digital commerce operations remained open and grew 79 percent on a currency-neutral basis, supported by distribution-center employees, while physical stores in its Nike Direct network gradually reopened—with over 90 percent operational globally as of July 17, 2020—demonstrating operational flexibility and responsiveness to evolving public health guidance.  Despite material adverse impacts on shipments to wholesale customers, wholesale revenues and store traffic, Nike maintained its long-term financial goals—high single-digit revenue growth, gross margin expansion, administrative expense leverage, mid-teens earnings-per-share growth and low-thirties return on invested capital—and remained committed to investing in innovation, realigning its product creation and category organizations around consumer constructs, reinvesting in its women’s and kids’ businesses, simplifying its operating model to optimize effectiveness and unifying investments in data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering, inventory management and other areas against an end-to-end technology foundation, all of which reflect the company’s systemic perspective, dynamic capabilities and resilience strategies to absorb strain and sustain performance under challenging conditions.

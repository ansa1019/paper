In our discussion of business continuity under the COVID-19 pandemic, we describe actions taken to maintain service delivery and support our operations despite external disruptions, including focused investments in data center capacity, servers, network infrastructure, office facilities and headcount scaling to absorb increased demand and preserve or improve our performance under extreme conditions; adaptive changes in our key metrics methodology, including complex algorithms and machine-learning models to estimate unique user engagement across products, and ongoing recalibrations of our collectibility assessments, credit loss estimates, impairment reviews and reserve levels in light of uncertain macroeconomic variables and pandemic-related constraints; strategic reorientation toward helping people stay connected, supporting public health responses and contributing to economic recovery; proactive planning for continued volatility in user growth, engagement and advertising demand, including regular forward-looking statements and sensitivity analyses; management of liquidity and capital resources through the deployment of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to fund capital expenditures, share repurchases, legal and regulatory settlements such as the $5.0 billion FTC penalty, and strategic investments like our $5.8 billion stake in Jio Platforms; rigorous evaluation and adjustment of contractual obligations, tax and legal contingencies, and operating and finance lease commitments to ensure resilience against future adverse conditions; and the commitment to support ongoing research and development, marketing, sales and general administrative functions through targeted hiring and expense growth, thereby reinforcing our ability to adapt, reconfigure resources and maintain system integrity and performance under challenging and evolving external pressures.

In fiscal 2020 we delivered growth in margins and earnings per share in a very challenging environment with the COVID-19 pandemic, operating amid broad-based weakening in the global macroeconomic environment that impacted our commercial and enterprise markets as well as continuing weakness in the service provider market and emerging countries, and we expect ongoing uncertainty in these markets; while the overall environment remains uncertain, we continued to aggressively invest in priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term and to preserve or improve our functioning despite adversity. During this extraordinary time we supported our employees through a seamless transition to work from home enabled by our long-standing flexible work policy and intent-based technologies, maintained operational continuity for those who must be on site with enhanced health and safety precautions, provided customers and partners with financial flexibility and business continuity via a Cisco Capital business resiliency program offering up-front payment holidays and deferred payments, and committed significant funds and technology to support global and local communities. We realigned the organization through a restructuring plan, incurring pretax charges of approximately $300 million to generate an estimated $1 billion of annualized cost savings and enable further investment in key strategic initiatives, and we reinvested substantially all cost savings in priority growth areas. We managed our supply chain and inventory through firm, noncancelable purchase commitments consistent with demand forecasts, assessed and updated our critical accounting estimates in light of pandemic-related variabilities, and maintained a strong position of cash, cash equivalents and investments to fund strategic acquisitions, customer financing and working capital needs. Throughout the year we focused on productivity improvements, favorable product mix, automation, security and analytics to deliver highly secure, software-defined, automated and intelligent platforms, and employed rigorous revenue recognition, loss contingency evaluation and valuation allowance judgments to safeguard our financial integrity and adaptive capacity under extreme conditions.

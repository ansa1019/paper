Throughout 2021 and into 2022, the Company has continually reinforced its capacity to absorb strain and sustain performance in the face of pandemic-related supply-chain disruptions, semiconductor shortages, extreme weather events and operational incidents by refining safety protocols in line with CDC guidelines, embedding a multi-faceted safety culture (including Courage to Care, COMMIT and peer-to-peer programs), deploying proprietary physics-based derailment-prevention software, engaging third-party experts for program validation and pursuing legal recourse to uphold federal vaccine mandates so as to forestall labor disputes that might threaten national rail continuity.  The Company has dynamically reallocated resources—augmenting crew and locomotive availability during network imbalances and subsequently rebalancing to actual volume levels—while blending service products and transportation plans to enhance train length, velocity and terminal dwell metrics, thereby mitigating network variability.  Its $3.3 billion 2022 capital plan prioritizes infrastructure hardening, asset replacement, targeted freight-car acquisitions, ramp modernization, locomotive modernization and operational-efficiency technology to bolster network resilience and business continuity.  Liquidity management encompasses cash and cash equivalents, a $2 billion revolving credit facility, a receivables facility and commercial paper, underpinned by scenario-based stress tests of interest rate, fuel price and tax sensitivities and sustained compliance with debt covenants.  Predictive analytics and risk assessments inform proactive mitigation of service interruptions and crossing hazards, and the newly released climate action plan aligns operational improvements, stakeholder collaboration and decarbonization efforts to fortify the Company’s systemic resilience and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

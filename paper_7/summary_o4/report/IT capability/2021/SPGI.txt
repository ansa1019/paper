We are continuing to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on all aspects of our business as the pandemic and associated macroeconomic impacts continue to evolve, and while COVID-19 did not have a material adverse effect on our reported results for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact it may have on our business, future results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We maintain a strong financial position, with cash on hand, cash flows from operations and availability under our existing five-year, $1.5 billion revolving credit facility expected to be sufficient to meet our operating and recurring cash needs into the foreseeable future, supporting business continuity through investments in our businesses, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends, debt repayment, capital expenditures and infrastructure enhancements. Our strategy framework seeks to deliver an exceptional, differentiated customer experience by enhancing foundational capabilities, evolving and growing our core businesses, and pursuing growth via adjacencies, including disciplined organic, inorganic and partnership strategies to meet cost and revenue synergy targets and fund key growth areas such as ESG, energy transition, China, private markets, credit and risk management, distribution and multi-asset, thematic and factor indices. We continue to respond to evolving customer needs and drive innovation by leveraging our data, technology and deep industry expertise, collaborating with customers, vendors and technology partners to develop a digital ecosystem strategy and deliver next-generation tools including data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning to unlock the power of our data and insights. Our operations are being transformed through key integration projects that help deliver on merger commitments, enhancements to tools and processes to expand intelligence and analytics capabilities, support data-driven decisions and improve end-user productivity, reimagining and implementing a future hybrid office model by standardizing our technology to reshape where and how we work and how we serve, and advancing our technical capabilities and data transformation while maintaining our commitment to risk management, control and compliance and strengthening engagement and partnership across the company. We are rolling out and embedding our new purpose and values to unify and combine S&P Global, encouraging career mobility and career development through coaching and Thrive, improving diverse representation through hiring, advancement and retention while continuing diversity, equity and inclusion education, and attracting and retaining our people through recognition programs, learning opportunities and fair compensation. Subject to closing conditions and regulatory approvals, we expect to complete the merger with IHS Markit in the first quarter of 2022, at which time the board will revisit our dividend policy and we will pursue additional capital, including the issuance of new senior notes and potential accordion increases to our existing credit facility, to support the combined companyâ€™s financial flexibility, resilience and growth in a dynamic environment.

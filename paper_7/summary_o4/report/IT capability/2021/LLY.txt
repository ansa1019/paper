In response to the covid-19 pandemic, we have focused on maintaining a supply of our medicines; reducing the strain on the medical system; developing treatments for covid-19; protecting the health, safety, and well-being of our employees; supporting our communities; and ensuring affordability of and access to our medicines, particularly insulin. As part of our response—and at the request of the U.S. and international governments—we invested in large-scale manufacturing of covid-19 antibodies at risk in order to ensure rapid access to patients around the world. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, adverse impacts from the focus of resources on covid-19, widespread protective measures, and the resulting strain on global transportation, manufacturing, and labor markets, which have negatively impacted development, manufacturing, supply, distribution, and sales of our medicines and led to increased costs to provide a consistent supply and potential disruptions in the supply of our medications. We manage research and development spending across our portfolio of potential new medicines so that a delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending and we view our business development activity—including acquisitions, collaborations, investments, and licensing arrangements—as a way to enhance our pipeline and strengthen our business. We believe our available cash and cash equivalents, together with our ability to generate operating cash flow and our access to short-term and long-term borrowings, are sufficient to fund our existing and planned capital requirements, and our management continuously evaluates our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can adequately and efficiently finance our capital requirements. Our risk management program, which includes the use of hedging and other risk management techniques, is designed to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, and we enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating exchange rates. We plan to invest more than $1 billion over several years in a new facility in Concord, North Carolina, to manufacture parenteral products and devices and more than €400 million in a new facility in Limerick, Ireland, to expand our manufacturing network for biologic active ingredients. We self-insure for litigation liability losses for all our currently marketed products and accrue for liability claims based on historical claims experience and product usage, and we maintain indemnification and insurance arrangements to mitigate exposure. We maintain consistent dividend distributions and share repurchase programs to support shareholder returns and financial flexibility, and we monitor and manage pricing, reimbursement, and access challenges—such as payor leverage, pricing pressures, and affordability programs—to sustain firm performance under pressure. Our operational measures—including capital expenditure planning, debt management, dynamic contingent consideration accounting, and the continuous evaluation of tax, legal, and regulatory environments—support our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite internal and external variations and disturbances, thereby fostering our resilience and capacity to adapt, reconfigure resources, and maintain system integrity and performance in challenging conditions.

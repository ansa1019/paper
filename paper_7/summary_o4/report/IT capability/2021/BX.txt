Blackstone’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates its emphasis on preserving positive adjustment under challenging conditions by prioritizing the safety and wellbeing of its employees and their families while ensuring the seamless functioning of the firm in serving its investors; where remote work was appropriate or recommended under local government guidelines, its technology infrastructure proved robust and capable of supporting a remote work model, and the firm implemented rigorous protocols for remote work—such as increased cadence of group calls and updates and frequent communication across leadership and working levels—and leveraged technology to ensure teams stayed connected and productive and that its culture remained strong. The firm’s investment committees continued to convene as needed, and it maintained operations across investment, asset management and corporate support functions; return-to-office protocols were developed and implemented in alignment with local public health and government guidance, incorporating testing, contact-tracing, social distancing and other safety measures, and the firm continues to closely monitor applicable guidance and the proliferation of variants. Throughout 2021, Blackstone’s businesses were materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic environment—such as heightened equity market volatility, global supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressure and anticipated interest-rate increases—requiring ongoing risk assessment, dynamic resource allocation, diversified business segments and strategic initiatives to maintain operational flexibility, preserve firm performance and support continuity of services under unexpected and extreme conditions.

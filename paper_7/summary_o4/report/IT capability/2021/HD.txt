The Company increased average inventory levels during fiscal 2021 to support the demand environment and made targeted investments in its supply chain network and digital platforms to drive an enhanced interconnected experience in both physical and digital worlds, while evaluating the recoverability of long-lived assets each quarter—including decisions to relocate or close locations based on future cash flow projections—to preserve or improve functioning under changing conditions. It generated $16.6 billion of net cash from operating activities and held $2.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents at January 30, 2022, supplemented by commercial paper programs and senior note issuances, demonstrating a disciplined capital allocation approach that first prioritizes investing in the business to sustain operations and long-term strategic positioning and then returns excess cash to shareholders through $7.0 billion of dividends and $14.8 billion of share repurchases, while maintaining the ability to obtain alternative financing and adjust capital expenditures (planned at approximately 2 percent of net sales for fiscal 2022) in response to the economic environment. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $2.3 billion year-over-year primarily due to changes in working capital driven by higher merchandise inventories, timing of vendor payments and foreign exchange fluctuations, and the Company incurred $262 million of COVID-19-related expenses during fiscal 2021 after cycling $2.1 billion of such expenses in fiscal 2020, alongside investing in hourly payroll costs. The Company’s return on invested capital metric further underscores its focus on the effective deployment of its capital base to absorb strain and maintain performance under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

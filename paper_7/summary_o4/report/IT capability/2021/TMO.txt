Thermo Fisher Scientific mobilized in early 2020 to support the COVID-19 pandemic response with products and services that helped “analyze, diagnose and protect from the virus,” scaled and evolved its molecular diagnostics solutions and plastic consumables businesses to respond to ongoing pandemic conditions, expanded biosciences and bioproduction capacity to meet pharma and biotech customers’ vaccine manufacturing requirements, and, through its pharma services business, provided the services needed to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally, thereby demonstrating adaptability, resource reconfiguration and preservation of functioning under severe external pressure. Although the pandemic’s impact materially reduced customer activity by late March 2020—adversely affecting the analytical instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, other segments—the negative impact significantly lessened in 2021 as the company reconstituted its trajectories toward the ensuing future, while acknowledging that future revenues remain uncertain and dependent on global control efforts. The company continued to execute its proven three-pillar growth strategy of developing “high-impact, innovative new products,” leveraging its scale in high-growth and emerging markets, and delivering “a unique value proposition” to customers, supported by strategic growth investments in geographic sales reach, e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, research and development projects and incentive compensation, all reflecting a systemic perspective on sustaining organizational health and competitive advantage. References to productivity improvements through its Practical Process Improvement business system—including “continuous improvement methodologies, global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing”—underscore efforts at cost efficiency, operational flexibility and risk mitigation. The company’s liquidity and capital resources management—maintaining $4.48 billion of cash and cash equivalents, generating $6.81 billion of free cash flow, accessing up to $5 billion under a new multi-currency revolving credit facility, and deploying capital primarily via mergers and acquisitions and secondarily via share buybacks and dividends—demonstrates financial resilience, future orientation and the ability to allocate resources to maintain continuity of operations under varying conditions. Finally, the disciplined use of non-GAAP measures to forecast and evaluate operational performance, the annual impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets, the fair-value measurement of contingent consideration and rigorous tax planning and valuation allowances illustrate organizational intelligence, strategic foresight and readiness to absorb strain, adjust to environmental fluctuations and preserve system integrity and performance.

In preparing our consolidated financial statements, management bases its assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and reassesses them regularly, recognizing that unanticipated events and circumstances may affect their accuracy and requiring ongoing risk assessment and adaptation; our subscription-based business model, which yields relatively predictable revenue and earnings and includes ratable recognition of cloud services and annualized recurring revenue adjustments for currency fluctuations, supports operational continuity and system resilience to environmental variations; we make significant investments in research and development, data center infrastructure and strategic acquisitions—allocating resources to enhance our integrated cloud-based and on-premise offerings and deploying a flexible, hybrid digital-first work model—thereby preserving or improving functioning despite the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic and broader macro-economic recovery, maintaining business continuity, employee health and safety; leveraging a data-driven operating model and comprehensive solution suite, we sustain competitive advantage through service innovation, seamless workflows and adaptive strategic initiatives such as targeted promotions, share repurchase programs and prudent liquidity and capital planning, all of which enable us to absorb strain, mitigate risks, reconfigure resources and emerge stronger from disruptive external pressures.

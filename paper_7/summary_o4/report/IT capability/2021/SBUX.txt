Starbucks results for fiscal 2021 demonstrate the overall strength and resilience of our brand, reflecting the company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity. During fiscal 2021 we began to experience certain supply shortages and transportation delays largely attributable to impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as changes in customer demand and behaviors; while we expect these shortages and delays may continue into fiscal 2022, we view them to be temporary and do not believe they will have a material impact to our long-term growth and profitability. Absent significant and prolonged COVID-19 relapses or global economic disruptions, and based on the current trend of our business operations and our focused efforts to elevate customer experiences, enhance digital capabilities and drive beverage innovation, we are confident in the strength of our brand and the durability of our long-term “growth at scale” strategy to deliver consistent revenue and income growth. In fiscal 2020, we announced a restructuring plan to optimize our North America store portfolio, primarily in dense, metropolitan markets, by blending store formats to better cater to changing customer tastes and preferences; as of the fiscal year ended October 3, 2021, we had substantially completed our restructuring plan, which resulted in the closure of 807 underperforming stores in the U.S. and Canada, with costs recorded as restructuring and impairments. This investment, combined with industry-leading benefits, supports Starbucks’ aspiration to remain an employer of choice that can attract and retain the high-quality talent necessary to support our continued growth. We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, make acquisitions and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases, believing that net future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future. Our market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk, including commodity price, foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, thereby strengthening our operational flexibility and capacity to maintain performance under pressure. While nearly all company-operated stores in key international markets remained open during the pandemic, modified operating protocols had an adverse impact to comparable store sales and operating results, demonstrating our ability to maintain operations and performance despite external pressures. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we replaced our $2.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility and our $1.0 billion unsecured 364-day credit facility with a new $3.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility, providing long-term funding capacity to support our strategic initiatives, preserve liquidity and sustain business continuity under exceptional conditions.

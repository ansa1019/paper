In fiscal 2021 we delivered revenues of $33.6 billion, an increase of 43%, and net income of $9.0 billion, up 74%, reflecting a recovery from the negative impacts of COVID-19 as our QCT segment’s results rebounded across handset, RFFE, automotive and IoT markets and benefited from higher average selling prices driven by 5G products; to mitigate semiconductor industry capacity constraints and secure future supply, we have entered into several, and expect to enter into additional, multi-year capacity purchase commitments with key suppliers of our integrated circuit products, while completing the acquisition of Nuvia to integrate its CPU and SoC technologies into our Snapdragon platforms and agreeing to acquire Veoneer to incorporate its computer vision, drive policy and driver-assistance capabilities—actions that reconfigure our resource allocation and reinforce core capabilities; our QTL segment recognized a 26% increase in licensing revenues as royalty streams resumed under a new global patent license agreement with Huawei; we maintain operational flexibility and business continuity through $12.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, a $4.5 billion revolving credit facility and a new $10 billion stock repurchase authorization, enabling increased investment in R&D—particularly in 5G and application processor technologies—and continued capital deployment for acquisitions, capacity commitments and shareholder returns; we continually assess and accrue for legal and regulatory contingencies, including $1.5 billion of EC fines under appeal, adjust income tax provisions for transfer pricing and final regulations, and proactively engage wireless industry participants and governments to support our licensing program and technology investments; these measures demonstrate our ability to absorb strain, preserve and improve functioning under external variations and disruptions, adapt and reconfigure our strategic initiatives, and maintain performance and business continuity in challenging conditions.

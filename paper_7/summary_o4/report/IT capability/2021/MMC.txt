Management reports that the Company’s businesses have demonstrated resilience throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, maintaining operational continuity despite prolonged remote working arrangements and evolving local health and safety regulations, with clear guidelines for return to office and sustained service delivery in both remote and in-office environments. Through its risk and insurance services and consulting segments, including Marsh’s data-driven risk advisory, insurance solutions and risk control and mitigation services and Guy Carpenter’s advanced risk, reinsurance and capital strategies, the Company supports clients in navigating dynamic and complex environments, absorbing strain from external pressures and preserving or improving functionality under challenging conditions. The integration of the JLT acquisition into the Company’s operations—encompassing severance, real estate and technology rationalization, process management consulting and legal entity restructuring—reflects deliberate reconfiguration of resources, processes and organizational structures, yielding at least $425 million of annualized savings to date and with remaining integration and restructuring costs expected to conclude during 2022. Strategic liquidity and capital management initiatives—such as entry into an amended $2.8 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility, expansion of the commercial paper program, senior note issuances and share repurchase authorizations—underscore the Company’s capacity to allocate financial resources, mitigate funding risks and adjust to variations in credit markets. The Company’s pension funding policies and targeted asset allocations for U.S. and U.K. plans, together with actuarial reviews of discount rates and expected returns, illustrate adaptive resource deployment to preserve plan integrity amid fluctuations in interest rates and asset values. Finally, the Company’s global footprint across 130 countries, combined with systematic monitoring of revenue drivers—including foreign currency impacts, acquisitions, dispositions and market demand—supports a trajectory of positive adjustment under uncertainty and sustains performance through both nominal and exceptional external disturbances.

Management’s discussion highlights that the full extent of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict; while most of our productions have resumed, certain productions—both our own and those of third-party suppliers and operational partners—continue to experience disruption, and new health and safety protocols and requirements can result in additional costs such as increased pay to cast and crew, personal protective equipment and testing. We will continue to actively monitor pandemic-related issues and may take further actions that alter our business operations as required by federal, state, local or foreign authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and stockholders. To support operational flexibility and maintain service continuity, we have built our own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”), the delivery expenses for which include equipment costs, payroll and related personnel expenses, cloud computing costs and other third-party costs, while other operations costs encompass customer service and payment processing fees and all costs directly incurred in making content available to members. We expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change and we may test other plan and price variations. Our primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, marketing programs, streaming delivery and personnel-related costs, and investments in original content—particularly content that we produce and own—require more cash upfront relative to licensed content; we expect to continue to significantly increase our investments in global content. We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources, including our revolving credit facility, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months and beyond, although our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and market conditions and may not be on terms acceptable to us or at all. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to increased investments in content requiring more upfront cash payments—payments for content assets increased by $4,933 million compared with an amortization increase of $1,423 million—partially offset by a 19 percent increase in revenues; this shift reflected delays in productions due to the pandemic and was accompanied by increased headcount to support continued improvements in our streaming service and international expansion. Liquidity and capital resource management further reflects that our debt, net of issuance costs, decreased through repayments and remeasurement of euro-denominated notes, that no amounts have been borrowed under our revolving credit agreement, and that operating lease obligations have increased to support growth in facilities, headcount and original productions, thereby reinforcing our resilience in meeting obligations and preserving operational integrity under challenging conditions.

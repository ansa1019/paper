Lockheed Martin operates amid complexity and continuing economic pressures, focusing on program execution, predictability of delivery and affordability initiatives while extending its portfolio domestically and internationally through disciplined internal realignments, independent research and development, strategic acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and equity investments to enhance operational flexibility and maintain continuity. The Company invests substantially in its workforce to ensure the technical skills necessary to meet rapidly evolving mission requirements and promotes innovation in products, services and processes to address changing customer needs. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Lockheed Martin faced increased costs, supply chain delays, travel and site access restrictions, employee absences, remote work challenges and fluctuating onsite attendance, prompting measures to protect employee health and safety, encourage vaccination, pause and resume workplace reintegration plans, closely monitor pandemic-related risks and accelerate more than $2.2 billion of supplier payments by year-end 2021—prioritizing small and impacted businesses—to mitigate disruptions and preserve contract execution. The Company continues to track developments regarding vaccine mandates, assess potential workforce attrition and adapt its 2022 outlook based on risk-assessed needs. Its financial resilience rests on robust cash from operations, access to credit markets, disciplined liquidity management, accelerated progress payments, strategic cash deployment across capital expenditures and pension risk-transfer transactions—including the purchase of annuity contracts transferring $4.9 billion of pension obligations—and a balanced return of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. To manage exposure to market and budgetary volatility, Lockheed Martin hedges foreign currency and interest rate risks with derivative instruments, applies the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method with continuous reassessment of technical, schedule and cost risks to measure progress and profit-booking rates on long-term contracts, conducts quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites—evaluating contamination extent, evolving regulatory standards and remediation technologies—and leverages government cost accounting standards to recover environmental and pension costs. The Company also addresses uncertainties in U.S. government funding, continuing resolutions and contract terminations by emphasizing production stability, rebaselining key programs such as the F-35, monitoring backlog conversion, managing pension and tax impacts and strategically allocating resources to maintain integrity and performance under adverse or exceptional conditions.

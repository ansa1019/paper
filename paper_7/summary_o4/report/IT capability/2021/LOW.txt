Throughout fiscal 2021, we maintained focus on delivering operating continuity and improving organizational flexibility through enhancements across our supply chain, store operations and digital platforms. Our perpetual productivity improvement (PPI) initiatives yielded operational process improvements that reduced non-productive tasks and freed associates to focus on customer service, while a new store inventory management system provided real-time visibility into inventory and a simplified user interface accelerated training and reduced customer wait times. We expanded our omnichannel fulfillment capabilities—converting three geographic areas to a market-based delivery model that bypasses stores, enabling real-time appliance tracking and same-day or next-day delivery—and leveraged our expanded supply chain network to position in-stock inventory for our heavy selling season. We enhanced the customer online shopping experience with improved search, navigation and visualization tools, and we continued to allocate resources across strategic initiatives to support long-term growth. Liquidity and business continuity were supported by $10.1 billion of cash flows from operations and access to $4.0 billion of undrawn capacity on revolving credit facilities, supplemented by issuances of $4.0 billion of unsecured notes and disciplined debt management to preserve financial flexibility. Capital expenditures of $1.9 billion were directed 75% to existing store investments, 15% to strategic initiatives and 10% to new stores and corporate facilities, reflecting our ability to adapt resource deployment under challenging conditions. We believe our diversified liquidity sources, ongoing access to capital markets and robust operational and financial controls enable us to absorb strain, preserve performance and emerge stronger from adversity.

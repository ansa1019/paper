PepsiCo’s Form 10-K describes how, as a global company with deep local ties, it confronted a broad array of challenges in 2021—ranging from the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic and supply-chain disruptions to inflationary pressures, shifting consumer behaviors, a highly competitive operating environment, a rapidly changing retail landscape and evolving legal and regulatory requirements—by implementing health and safety protocols, business continuity plans and crisis-management protocols; by managing commodity, foreign-exchange and interest-rate risks through fixed-price contracts, pricing agreements and derivative instruments; and by leveraging an integrated risk management framework that, under Board and committee oversight and supported by a dedicated risk management office, corporate audit and compliance functions, enables the company to identify, assess, prioritize, address, monitor and communicate strategic, operational, financial, compliance, safety and reputational risks across its divisions and key markets.  To foster long-term sustainable growth and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, PepsiCo launched “PepsiCo Positive (Pep+),” a strategic end-to-end transformation with sustainability at its center, guides its efforts to restore regenerative agricultural practices, build circular and inclusive value chains and engage consumers to make positive choices, and drives the company’s ongoing reviews of capital structure, liquidity sources, net capital spending plans, free cash flow generation and return on invested capital to ensure adequate resource allocation, operational flexibility and financial resilience.  Moreover, in support of organizational resilience under both nominal and extreme conditions, the company continues to monitor and advocate with respect to taxes and regulations, regularly evaluates productivity and efficiency initiatives—such as its multi-year productivity plan to simplify, harmonize and automate processes, reconfigure go-to-market and information systems and optimize its manufacturing and supply-chain footprint—and maintains sufficient liquidity through revolving credit facilities, working capital lines and access to capital markets to preserve its integrity and performance.

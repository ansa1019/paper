Bank of America regularly evaluates protocols and processes to execute its business continuity plans, ensuring operational flexibility and the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, and has developed contingency funding and recovery plans—complemented by enterprise-wide stress testing under multiple macroeconomic scenarios—to provide liquidity and capital in response to both expected and unexpected cash flow or collateral needs. The corporation maintains global liquidity sources in the form of cash and high-quality, unencumbered securities, diversifies funding across stable deposits, secured and unsecured borrowings, and monitors liquidity under stress events through contingency and resolution planning that supports a single-point-of-entry resolution strategy. Guided by a formal risk framework approved by the board and enterprise risk committee, strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational, reputational and climate risks are identified, measured, monitored and controlled through quantitative metrics such as value-at-risk limits, scenario analysis and capital planning, as well as an enterprise model risk policy. Governance and oversight are provided through board and management committees, supported by a three-lines-of-defense structure of front-line units, global risk management and corporate audit, together with robust credit risk management, operational resilience practices, information security and cybersecurity programs, and climate risk oversight, which enable the organization to absorb strain, adapt, reconfigure and preserve or enhance its integrity and performance despite internal or external variations and disturbances.

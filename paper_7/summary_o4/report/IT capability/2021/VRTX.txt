The company’s discussion of its business strategy and operations illustrates multiple facets of organizational resilience, beginning with its strategic investment in scientific innovation and the diversification of its pipeline through both internal research efforts and external collaborations to absorb strain and maintain or improve functioning in the face of adversity. It describes its ability to reconfigure operations in response to external disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic by adjusting site-specific business practices, continuously monitoring local trends and government guidance, and ensuring the stability of its supply chains through a global network of third-party partners and internal manufacturing and distribution capabilities. The firm emphasizes its operational flexibility in adapting supply chains—adding new formulations or scaling production as needed—and its commitment to absorbing new knowledge and commercial insights by frequently evaluating discovery, research, clinical and nonclinical activities, which enables rapid shifts in focus and priorities. Management allocates substantial resources to research, development and quality assurance, balancing risk and potential across programs, and dedicates management and financial resources to stakeholder engagement with third-party payors and government agencies to secure reimbursement and maintain business continuity. From a financial resilience perspective, the company manages its liquidity and capital structure through revolving credit facilities, cash flow forecasting and share repurchase programs, aiming to preserve operating flexibility and sustain performance under pressure.

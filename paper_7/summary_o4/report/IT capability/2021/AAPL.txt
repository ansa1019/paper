In response to the COVID-19 pandemic—which has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets—the company enacted measures such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary retail store closures, and quarantine protocols, with many employees working remotely; it has since reopened all retail stores and substantially all other facilities subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the safety of employees and customers and continues to manage reopening under local rules and regulations. During the fourth quarter of 2021, disruptions at component suppliers and logistical service providers led to supply shortages that affected sales worldwide, with similar disruptions possible in the future, prompting the company to utilize outsourcing partners that acquire components and build product based on demand information covering periods up to 150 days to mitigate supply chain risk. To support business continuity and resilience, the company maintains substantial liquidity—$172.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities as of September 25 2021—supplemented by cash generated by operations and continued access to debt markets, believing these resources will suffice to satisfy cash requirements and its capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond; its contractual obligations—including debt with varying maturities, commercial paper, leases, manufacturing and other purchase obligations—are managed to balance resource deployment and flexibility. Management’s critical accounting estimates and judgments, based on historical experience and reasonable assumptions, inform evaluations related to uncertain tax positions, legal and other contingencies—where resolution in a manner inconsistent with expectations could materially impact financial condition and operating results—and are part of the framework for assessing and preserving the company’s financial integrity and performance under pressure.

During fiscal 2021, despite the significant impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the business environment and our clients, we maintained uninterrupted delivery of cloud-based human capital management services—including payroll processing and tax obligations—while prioritizing the safety of our associates and the needs of our clients, providing information and tools to help clients understand and navigate governmental relief, and deploying a return-to-workplace solution that streamlines safe reintegration of employees; we advanced our next-generation, highly scalable, policy-based payroll framework and introduced AI-driven, mobile-first payroll products and diversity, equity and inclusion analytics on our data cloud platform to anticipate evolving client needs and foster operational flexibility under dynamic conditions; the pandemic reinforced demand for robust workforce management solutions supporting increasingly flexible schedules, which contributed to record client growth and underpinned our low-capital-intensity, highly cash generative model; we generated sufficient free cash flow to satisfy dividends, modest debt obligations, and reinvest strategically in research and development and transformation initiatives—such as broad-based capacity actions, excess capacity severance, lease and asset impairments, and disciplined non-essential spend management—thus enhancing our ability to absorb downturns, preserve financial resilience and operational continuity, and remain steadfast in executing our longer-term strategy; our liquidity position remained solid with $2.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $24.4 billion of marketable securities, access to $9.7 billion of committed credit facilities and high-quality short-term funding programs, while our client-funds investment strategy—laddering maturities to five- to ten-year horizons, impounding client funds in advance of remittance obligations, and employing reverse repurchase agreements and commercial paper when needed—ensured sufficient resources to meet obligations under varying interest-rate and market conditions; concurrently, we managed insurance exposure in our PEO segment through actuarially determined indemnity reserves and ceded reinsurance to cap per-occurrence losses, supporting segment profitability and risk mitigation; collectively, these measures reflect our ability to absorb strain, preserve performance under external disruptions, reconfigure trajectories in immediate response to events, and reconstitute our operations toward an adaptive, future-oriented posture, consistent with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

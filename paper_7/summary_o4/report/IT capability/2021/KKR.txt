KKR & Co. Inc. acknowledges that global and regional economic conditions, including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, have had and may continue to have disruptive impacts on its business by affecting investment valuations, exit opportunities, capital-raising capacity and new investment activities. Management continuously monitors and updates reserve and expense assumptions—including mortality, lapse, interest crediting and market-linked embedded derivative valuations—in order to maintain the integrity of its insurance liabilities and attendant asset portfolios, and it reviews these assumptions at least annually. To mitigate market, credit and liquidity risks, KKR pursues a diversified multi-asset strategy spanning private equity, real assets, credit, hedge funds and insurance, broadens its capital base across regional and product lines, and supplements its funds with committed co-investment and balance-sheet capital that can be allocated tactically in response to volatility and dislocation in equity, credit, commodities and foreign exchange markets. The firm uses derivative overlays and credit facilities to hedge position-level risks, manages short- and medium-term interest rate exposures, regularly assesses potential clawback and netting-hole obligations in its carried interest structures, and maintains access to committed revolving credit arrangements to support near-term funding requirements. KKR has also adopted a two-tiered financial reporting approach to enhance transparency around its asset management and newly acquired insurance operations, reflecting distinct liability and asset characteristics, and employs a disciplined governance process—including independent valuation committees, external pricing vendors and audit committee reviews—for fair-value measurements across Levels I, II and III. Through a combination of strategic acquisitions, varied fee-based and performance-based revenue streams, proactive assumption reviews, and capital-allocation mechanisms designed to balance risk and return, KKR seeks to preserve organizational continuity and sustain operating performance under challenging conditions.

Management identifies organizational resilience as the ability to absorb operational strain and maintain positive adjustment under internal or external disruptions by preserving or improving functioning across its global operations, supply chains and financial systems. To achieve this, the company maintains business continuity through risk mitigation strategies that include managing key manufacturing and supply arrangements, executing supply chain optimizations and implementing extended payment terms and a supply chain finance program to enhance supplier collaboration and liquidity. Productivity improvement initiatives—such as outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and overhead and workforce restructuring—enable resource reconfiguration, operational flexibility and cost savings, which are reinvested in innovation, marketing and capacity expansion. The company actively monitors and responds to macroeconomic and regulatory perturbations—including commodity price volatility, foreign currency fluctuations, government policies on taxation, trade and environmental matters—using hedging programs, disciplined capital allocation and strong credit facilities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, management prioritized protecting employee health and safety, maximizing availability of essential products, adapting manufacturing and distribution processes and working with authorities to keep facilities operational, while proactively planning for demand shifts, retailer restocking and consumer pantry destocking. By combining continuous innovation, balanced top- and bottom-line growth, strategic foresight and robust cash-flow generation, the company seeks to sustain its integrity, effectively respond to disruptive change and emerge stronger under challenging conditions.

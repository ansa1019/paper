In the Management’s Discussion and Analysis, the Company highlights the role of its Now Platform in enabling customers’ digital transformation from manual, disconnected processes to integrated automated workflows that increase resiliency and security and deliver additional value to employees and consumers. Contracted remaining performance obligations increased 29% year-over-year, reflecting the Company’s capacity to generate and reconfigure future revenue streams. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has focused on maintaining business continuity, supporting employees, customers and communities, and implementing operational changes that have not affected, and are not expected to affect, its ability to maintain operations, including financial reporting systems, internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. The flexible, geography-based return-to-work approach adapts to public health protocols and pandemic severity while preserving operational continuity. The Company manages external pressures such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates through derivative hedges designed to mitigate, though not fully eliminate, adverse currency movements. It further reinforces resilience by preserving strong liquidity, generating positive operating cash flows over ten years, maintaining substantial cash, cash equivalents and investments, and retaining free cash flow to service liabilities, fund cancellable and non-cancellable commitments, expand data center capacity, invest in strategic acquisitions and support its workforce. The Company anticipates that its diversified funding sources and continued growth in subscription and professional services revenues, coupled with disciplined capital deployment under cancelable arrangements and robust working capital management, will sustain its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite ongoing operating and economic uncertainties.

The pandemic caused by the novel strain of the coronavirus (COVID-19) and the numerous measures implemented by government authorities in response have impacted and likely will continue to impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers and those of our respective vendors and suppliers, prompting us to modify our business practices (including restricting employee travel, modifying employee work locations and cancelling physical participation in meetings, events and conferences) and to consider further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers and shareholders; while we are confident that our strategy and long-term contingency planning have positioned us well to weather the current uncertainty, we cannot at this time fully quantify or forecast the impact of COVID-19 on our business, which will depend on future developments, such as the continued duration and severity of the pandemic, the spread of more contagious variants of the virus, the adoption rate of vaccines, actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. On August 26, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., an independent manufacturer of innovative analog and mixed-signal products and technologies, which contributed incremental revenue and required us to integrate operations, record fair value adjustments to inventory, amortize intangible assets, consolidate certain wafer and test facility operations (resulting in the sale of our facility in Singapore and cessation of production at our Hillview manufacturing facility in Milpitas, California), and undertake repositioning actions to better align our global workforce with our long-term strategic plan. Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2021 decreased primarily as a result of recording additional costs related to the acquisition, including cost of goods sold fair-value adjustments and amortization expense of intangible assets, which were partially offset by the favorable impact of higher utilization of our factories due to increased customer demand. Research and development expenses increased versus prior year primarily due to higher employee-related variable compensation, incremental expenses from the acquisition and higher salary and benefit expenses; we believe a continued commitment to R&D is essential to maintain product leadership and provide innovative new product offerings, and accordingly expect to continue making significant R&D investments in the future. Special charges recorded during the period include severance, fringe benefit and one-time termination costs related to facility closures and workforce consolidation, as well as write-offs of acquired intellectual property tied to discontinued product development strategies. At October 30, 2021, our principal source of liquidity was $1,978.0 million of cash and cash equivalents, held approximately $876.6 million in the United States and the balance in foreign subsidiaries, and we manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds held by our foreign subsidiaries and the cost-effectiveness of repatriation; we do not expect current regulatory restrictions or taxes on repatriation to have a material adverse effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations and believe that our existing sources of liquidity, together with cash expected to be generated from future operations and available financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, R&D efforts and dividend payments in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months. We maintain a five-year unsecured $2.5 billion revolving credit facility that we may borrow against for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes, subject to covenants, including a consolidated leverage ratio covenant, with which we were in compliance as of October 30, 2021. As of that date, we had $6.8 billion of carrying value outstanding on our debt, with indentures that may limit our ability to incur secured debt, enter into sale-leaseback transactions or consolidate with or transfer substantially all of our assets; we were compliant with all such covenants and on November 4, 2021 redeemed $500 million of Maxim’s 3.375% senior notes due 2023. In September 2021, we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements to purchase $2.5 billion of our common stock, reflecting our strategic flexibility in capital deployment. Net additions to property, plant and equipment were $343.7 million in fiscal 2021, funded by cash on hand and cash generated from operations, and we expect capital expenditures of 6–8% of revenue in fiscal 2022 to expand internal manufacturing capacity. We regularly hedge our non-U.S.-dollar–based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts with maturities generally ranging from one to twelve months; our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro, and a 10% unfavorable movement in exchange rates would result in approximately $39.5 million of losses in earnings or cash flows. Based on $500 million of floating rate debt outstanding, our annual interest expense would change by approximately $5 million for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates, and a hypothetical 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve would not materially impact the fair market value of our investment portfolio, reflecting our ongoing management of market and liquidity risk. As of October 30, 2021, we maintained days sales outstanding of 55 and days cost of sales in inventory of 118, reflecting normal variations in collections, billings and forecasted demand versus actual demand, as well as additional fair-value adjustments to acquired inventory. We periodically assess our global macroeconomic environment and undertake restructuring actions to improve operational effectiveness, efficiency and the alignment of expenses with revenues, and we continue to monitor our contingent liabilities, including potential claims and litigation, to ensure appropriate recognition of losses when probable and reasonably estimable.

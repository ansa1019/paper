During the 2020–2021 period, the Company adjusted its strategies to absorb strain and preserve functionality despite the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including significant declines and subsequent rebounds in travel demand and cancellation volatility. It increased inter-brand collaboration and resource interdependency, expanded its product and payment offerings such as a merchant-based transaction model to maintain operational continuity and enhance flexibility, and innovated its user experience on online and mobile platforms to meet evolving customer needs. Marketing and promotional spend was dynamically managed in line with changing booking patterns and returns on investment, while foreign currency risks were mitigated through designated hedging of euro-denominated debt and the use of derivative instruments. Workforce restructurings and participation in government assistance programs were deployed to optimize cost efficiency, and capital investments—including the acquisitions of Getaroom and an agreement to acquire Etraveli—supported the reconfiguration of long-term growth trajectories. Impairment tests on goodwill and investments incorporated scenario analyses of cash flow impacts, recovery timing, and discount rate adjustments, and the Company engaged in proactive tax and regulatory negotiations, such as with French tax authorities and pension funds, to manage potential liabilities and sustain its integrity and performance under internal and external perturbations.

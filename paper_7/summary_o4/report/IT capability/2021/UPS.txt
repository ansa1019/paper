Management describes its strategic journey as “customer first, people led, innovation driven” within a “better not bigger framework,” focusing on “improving revenue quality, reducing our cost to serve, growing operating profit and allocating capital in a disciplined fashion,” reflecting a systemic perspective on resource allocation and performance maintenance under challenging conditions.  The customer-first component targets enhancements in “speed and ease of access to our services” while the innovation-driven approach “utilizes technology and automation to deliver sustainable improvements to our network and to enhance the customer experience,” evincing organizational agility, service innovation and adaptability in the face of external pressures.  The discussion acknowledges that “the COVID-19 pandemic continued to have, and is expected to continue to have, an impact on our business” yet notes a “year-over-year increase in commercial volume as business returned to pre-pandemic levels,” illustrating positive adjustment under adversity and preservation of functioning despite environmental perturbations.  Management states “we continue to monitor the impacts of these external conditions on our business; however, we anticipate that demand for our services will remain strong,” demonstrating ongoing risk assessment, future orientation and continuity planning.  The divestiture of UPS Freight “used the cash proceeds of $848 million to reduce outstanding indebtedness” and the acquisition of Roadie, “a technology platform focused on same-day delivery services,” exemplify reconfiguring and resource redeployment toward resilience strategies and transformation for competitive advantage.  Updates to the “cost allocation methodology for aircraft engine maintenance expense to better align with aircraft utilization by segment” underscore operational flexibility and resource reconfiguration.  The use of non-GAAP measures “to assist users of our financial statements in more fully understanding our financial results and assessing our ongoing performance,” including for “business unit resource allocation and in connection with incentive compensation award determinations,” embodies organizational intelligence, knowledge management and strategic foresight.  Currency-neutral revenue, revenue per piece and operating-profit metrics are calculated “to allow users of our financial statements to understand growth trends,” mitigating volatility from currency fluctuations and external disturbances.  The recognition of “changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10% corridor” outside of ordinary operations highlights risk mitigation and volatility removal.  Commitments to capital expenditures—“approximately $5.5 billion in 2022, of which approximately 60 percent will be allocated to expansion projects”—signal proactive measures, future planning and performance maintenance through resource generation and expansion.  Liquidity is maintained via “adequate” cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and “access to commercial paper programs and capital markets” to fund “short- and long-term cash requirements,” reflecting business continuity planning and resilience to financial shocks.  The establishment of self-insurance reserves “based on actuarial estimates … through a complex process that includes the application of various actuarial methods and assumptions” and the policy to record “a liability for a loss when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable” illustrate risk assessment, preparation for adverse events and resource allocation for recovery.  Impairment testing of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets via discounted-cash-flow models, market comparables and sensitivity analyses demonstrates dynamic capabilities, systemic change management and contingency planning to preserve organizational health under variable conditions.

Abbott’s diversified health care businesses have demonstrated organizational resilience by maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions, deriving revenues from a broad line of products under short-term receivable arrangements, and adapting operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; in 2020 and 2021, some businesses performed at levels required to meet new demands, others faced challenges during surge periods, and still others were relatively less impacted, reflecting operational flexibility and performance maintenance under external disturbances. Abbott mobilized its teams across multiple fronts to develop and launch various new diagnostic tests for COVID-19, aligned its manufacturing network for COVID-19 diagnostic tests with changes in projected testing demand, recorded restructuring charges—including fixed-asset write-downs, inventory-related adjustments, and contract cancellations—and later reconstituted inventory value as demand increased with the emergence of new variants. The company continually monitors the effects of the pandemic on its operations, ensures global alignment with specific governmental orders and guidelines, and has taken aggressive steps to limit exposure to COVID-19 and enhance facility safety. To date, Abbott has managed supply chain challenges without significant disruption of services, raw materials, or supplies, and expects to mitigate ongoing inflationary pressures through price increases and gross margin improvement initiatives. Abbott maintains strong financial resources—including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments totaling approximately $10.2 billion, investment-grade credit facilities allowing up to $5 billion of unsecured borrowings, and long-term debt ratings of A+ (S&P) and A2 (Moody’s)—and believes that operating cash flow will continue to exceed capital expenditures and dividends, thereby preserving system integrity under internal and external variations. Strategic initiatives for 2022 focus on continuing to meet demand for COVID-19 tests, investing in product development areas that offer sustainable growth, driving market adoption and geographic expansion of key platforms across diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products, and emerging-market pharmaceuticals, and managing a competitive research and development portfolio targeted at approximately 7 percent of total sales, collectively supporting adaptation, recovery, and the maintenance or improvement of organizational performance under evolving pressures.

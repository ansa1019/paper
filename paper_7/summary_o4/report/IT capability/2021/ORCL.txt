The Company emphasizes providing choice and flexibility to customers through on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid deployment models, supplemented by programs that enable customers to pivot existing applications and infrastructure licenses to the Oracle Cloud and to migrate and expand workloads, supported by sustained investments in research and development, cloud operations, data center capacity and geographic footprint expansion to absorb strain and preserve functioning under challenging conditions. The cloud and license business benefits from a predominantly fixed short-term cost structure and upward revenue trends, providing operational leverage, while its selective and active acquisition program is guided by rigorous financial impact assessments and funded through internally available cash, operational cash flows, marketable securities and borrowings. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company curtailed variable expenditures—primarily travel and marketing—implemented a 2019 restructuring plan to improve cost structure and reallocate resources toward strategic cloud initiatives, and expects these expenses to normalize as economic and health conditions improve, even as it plans to accelerate investments in its cloud and license business in fiscal 2022. The Company’s capital allocation framework reflects sufficient working capital, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to meet working capital, capital expenditure and contractual obligation requirements, to fund dividends, debt repayments and stock repurchases under an ongoing authorization, and to support near-complete free cash flow conversion of net income. Risk mitigation practices include routine quarterly reviews and valuation allowances for tax and legal contingencies, detailed constant-currency reporting to isolate performance from currency fluctuations, and comprehensive accounting policies for revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessments. The services business leverages extensive experience, broad intellectual property and best practices to help customers maximize the performance of their Oracle technologies, while stock-based compensation programs, complemented by ongoing share repurchases, align employee incentives, manage potential dilution and contribute to organizational resilience and long-term performance.

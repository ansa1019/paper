Throughout the year ended December 31, 2021, management executed a range of strategic, operational and financial measures to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity, including the rapid integration of Sprint through restructuring initiatives—such as retail store and network site rationalization, severance programs and network decommissioning—and the realization of synergies and cost efficiencies to streamline operations; accelerated build-out of a nationwide 5G network alongside master lease negotiations and vendor financing to enhance network robustness; proactive liquidity management via cash flows from operations, securitizations of installment-plan receivables, financing leases, a $5.5 billion revolving credit facility and opportunistic long-term debt issuances to ensure sufficient resources for ongoing capital expenditures and strategic spectrum acquisitions; operational flexibility during the COVID-19 pandemic through retail adaptation, social distancing, enhanced cleaning and on-site employee testing while maintaining critical communications infrastructure for customers and communities; and a comprehensive response to the August 2021 cyberattack—including immediate forensic investigation, engagement of leading cybersecurity experts and law enforcement, swift closure of unauthorized access, notification of affected individuals consistent with regulatory requirements, resetting of account credentials, offerings of identity protection and scam-blocking services, and establishment of a cyber transformation office reporting directly to the CEO—to mitigate risk, reinforce security, sustain customer trust and maintain service continuity under challenging conditions.

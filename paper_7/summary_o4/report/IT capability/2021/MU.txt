The Company’s discussion of capital and operational initiatives demonstrates its capacity to absorb strain and preserve performance amid internal and external variations. In 2022 it plans $11–$12 billion of capital expenditures—weighted toward the first half of the year—for continued 176-layer NAND transitions, pilot‐line enablement for next-generation NAND and DRAM, and infrastructure investments to support EUV lithography, reflecting a future‐oriented resource allocation strategy to maintain system integrity under turbulent market conditions. Liquidity management measures—including a $2.50 billion revolving credit facility, $10.40 billion of cash and marketable securities diversified among high‐credit‐quality issuers, and anticipated $900 million proceeds from the sale of the Lehi facility—mitigate financial risks and support business continuity. The change from average cost to FIFO inventory costing and concurrent modifications to cost absorption processes adjust the timing of cost recognition consistent with volatile average selling prices and ensure that inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, enabling adaptive provisioning under adverse market fluctuations. Revision of estimated useful lives for NAND wafer fabrication and R&D equipment from five to seven years as of Q1 2020 and impairment reviews—triggered by the cessation of depreciation on assets held for sale and a $435 million write-down charge—illustrate dynamic capabilities to reconfigure resources, reconstitute cost structures, and maintain operational flexibility. Continuous improvement initiatives and manufacturing cost reductions, including lower underutilization costs at MTU, contributed to a gross margin increase to 38% in fiscal 2021 despite declines in NAND selling prices, evidencing the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Revenue diversification across DRAM and NAND product lines—driven by broad-based bit shipment growth, increased mobile MCP sales, and strong demand in automotive and industrial markets—helped offset disruptions from COVID-19 supply-chain constraints and fluctuating customer orders. Rigorous critical accounting estimates—covering contingencies, goodwill impairment testing, deferred tax asset realizability, and recoverability of property, plant, and equipment—underscore a systemic approach to risk assessment and resilience engineering. Net cash provided by operating activities of $12.47 billion, supported by lower inventories and disciplined receivables management, further strengthens the organization’s ability to confront unexpected situations, sustain functioning, and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

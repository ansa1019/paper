Merck has remained focused on protecting the safety of its employees, ensuring that its supply of medicines and vaccines reaches its patients, contributing its scientific expertise to the development of an antiviral therapy, supporting efforts to expand manufacturing capacity and supply of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 medicines and vaccines, and supporting health care providers and Merck’s communities, actions that illustrate the Company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite the presence of adversity.  Although COVID-19-related disruptions negatively affected results in 2021 and 2020, Merck continues to experience strong global underlying demand across its business and has entered into multiple agreements to support efforts to expand manufacturing capacity and supply of COVID-19 medicines and vaccines.  The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority is providing funding to adapt and make available a number of existing manufacturing facilities for the production of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccines and medicines, Merck has also entered into agreements to support the manufacturing and supply of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine, and Merck is using its own facilities in the U.S. to produce drug substance, formulate and fill vials of that vaccine, reflecting resource reconfiguration, inter-organizational collaboration and operational flexibility in response to external pressures.  The Company is allocating resources to support near-term commercial opportunities while investing heavily in research to support future innovations and long-term growth, and “continues to execute scientifically compelling business development opportunities to augment its pipeline,” demonstrating forward orientation, strategic adaptation and resilience strategies.  Operating expenses in both 2020 and 2021 were materially affected by reallocations to COVID-19-related research programs, offsetting lower spending in other areas.  Merck anticipates that global cost-containment pressures and healthcare pricing reforms will continue to negatively affect revenue performance, underscoring its ongoing risk mitigation efforts, including revenue hedging, balance sheet risk management and net investment hedging programs, the use of local currency options, forwards and collars to protect against volatility in foreign exchange, and interest rate swaps to manage exposure to rate changes and reduce overall borrowing costs.  The Company expects foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to be met through existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated operating cash flows and, if needed, commercial paper and long-term borrowings, and believes its sources of financing will be adequate to meet future requirements, reflecting preparedness, strategic planning and the maintenance of organizational integrity under challenging conditions.

Although the current COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business operations and practices, we experienced limited disruptions during 2021, we are taking safety measures to protect our employees who are in the office and support those employees who work from home, and we are also monitoring our operations and public health measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic. COVID-19 also continues to impact the global supply chain, causing disruptions to service providers, logistics and the flow and availability of supplies and products; despite these challenges, we took action to maintain a stable supply of materials to meet our production requirements and delivered incremental supply throughout the year, and we also experienced strong customer demand in 2021 and made strategic investments through long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements in our supply chain to secure additional capacity to support future revenue growth under our amended wafer supply agreement, while retaining full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node. Due to our strong financial results and growing cash flow generation, in May 2021 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to purchase up to $4 billion of our outstanding common stock in the open market, which does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We believe our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows from operations along with our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures and purchase commitments, over the next 12 months and beyond, and we believe we will be able to access the capital markets should we require additional funds. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, goodwill and income taxes, and we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.

we have been successful historically in adapting our business to changes in general economic health and competition, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items and through online offerings; comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency and average ticket, enabling us to leverage selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales and enhance profitability; we also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses, recognizing that available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, initial operating profitability is lower and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses may occur, but these negative aspects continue to decline in significance; with respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize wages and benefits but to maintain compensation levels that are better than the industry average in order to reduce employee turnover and enhance employee satisfaction; during 2021, covid-related supply and logistics constraints adversely affected some merchandise categories and are expected to do so for the foreseeable future, we paid $515 million in incremental wages related to covid-19 and, effective March 1, 2021, permanently increased wages for hourly and most salaried warehouse employees with an estimated annualized pre-tax cost of approximately $400 million; we use different risk management mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and participation in a reinsurance program, and estimate retained liabilities using historical claims experience, demographic and severity factors and other actuarial assumptions; management believes that our cash and investment position and operating cash flows as well as capacity under existing and available credit agreements will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future; we maintain bank credit facilities, cash and short-term investments, have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect, and continuously review and evaluate critical accounting estimates based on historical experience and reasonable assumptionsâ€”all of which support our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under internal and external variations and disturbances.

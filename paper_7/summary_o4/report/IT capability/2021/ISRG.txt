In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, management implemented a multi-faceted crisis management strategy aimed at absorbing strain and preserving or improving functioning despite the presence of adversity, including continuously updating health and safety policies for patients, customers, communities, and employees and adopting flexible remote-and-hybrid work arrangements to secure its workforce economically. To ensure business continuity and mitigate supply chain disruptions, the company worked closely with suppliers and distributors to maintain uninterrupted availability of systems and consumables, increased inventory levels by $256 million to buffer against logistics challenges and semiconductor shortages, and consolidated production capacity to address unexpected operational constraints. A customer relief program provided service-fee credits, deferred lease payments, and extended payment terms, thereby easing financial pressures on hospital customers and safeguarding future revenue streams. Organizational adaptability was further enhanced through strategic investment in an integrated digital ecosystem of analytics, on-demand support, telepresence case observation, and personalized training pathways designed to decrease procedural variability and optimize efficiency. The extended-use program, by increasing instrument cycles from 10 to 12–18 uses, exemplified resource reconfiguration to lower per-procedure costs and sustain operations under adverse conditions. Alternative financing options, such as operating leases and usage-based models, enabled customers to manage capital allocation flexibly while allowing the company to smooth deployment trajectories amid market cyclicality. In parallel, management continued to invest in priority development programs—spanning robotic platforms, advanced instrumentation, and informatics—while eliminating avoidable spend, reflecting a systemic perspective on resilience that balances resource generation for innovation with rigorous cost management and positions the organization to recover and flourish under turbulent conditions.

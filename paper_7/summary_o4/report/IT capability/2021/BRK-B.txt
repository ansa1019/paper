Berkshire Hathaway operates a highly decentralized organizational structure whereby each operating business retains independent underwriting and investment decision-making authority, enabling timely continuity and flexibility in response to external disruptions. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the company noted that “the effects to date rang[e] from relatively minor to severe” and observed that “over the second half of 2020 and continuing in 2021, many of these businesses experienced significant recoveries in revenues and earnings, in some instances exceeding pre-pandemic levels.” Despite acknowledging it “cannot reliably predict future economic effects of the pandemic or when business activities … will completely normalize,” Berkshire has maintained ample liquidity and a strong capital base, insisting on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments and setting prudent thresholds for share repurchases. In its insurance operations, management distinguishes underwriting from investing activities, treats investment gains and losses as non-operating to focus on underwriting performance, and absorbs the significant volatility of catastrophe losses by establishing robust loss reserves, deferring charges under retroactive reinsurance and amortizing them over claim settlement periods. The railroad and utilities segments reported demand shocks from the pandemic and extreme weather but achieved volume and revenue recoveries through productivity improvements, fuel-surcharge mechanisms and regulatory rate adjustments, while Precision Castparts “resized, restructured and improved operations” in response to reduced aircraft build rates. Distributors such as TTI and McLane adapted to ongoing global supply chain disruptions by adjusting inventory levels, expanding hiring and accepting higher material and freight costs. Across all segments, Berkshire’s strategic focus on decentralized decision rights, diversification of revenue streams, conservative liquidity management, adaptive resource allocation and continuous performance monitoring reflects the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, enabling the preservation and improvement of functioning despite pervasive adversity.

Schwab’s enterprise risk management framework incorporates the firm’s purpose, vision and values to establish a clear risk appetite approved by the board of directors and to embed risk-management practices across hierarchical levels, enabling the organization to maintain integrity and performance under internal and external disturbances. Through oversight by the global risk committee and its functional sub-committees—covering operational risk, information security and technology resilience, fraud prevention, third-party risk, data and model governance—and a dedicated incentive compensation risk oversight committee, the company identifies, measures, monitors and mitigates risks ranging from system failures and cyber threats to compliance, market, credit and liquidity stresses. As part of its integration of TD Ameritrade, the company aligned TD Ameritrade’s risk practices with Schwab’s risk appetite, reinforcing a systemic perspective and adaptability in organizational change processes. Schwab maintains a geographically dispersed backup and recovery infrastructure, routinely tests its business continuity and disaster recovery plans and conducts regular liquidity and capital stress tests while maintaining a capital contingency plan to ensure operational continuity and sufficient funding even under extreme conditions. Policies and procedures govern fraud risk, anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance, privacy, fiduciary obligations and conduct risk to reduce vulnerabilities and protect organizational coherence. Credit limits, portfolio diversification, collateral arrangements and counterparty assessments underwrite resilience in lending and investment activities, while regular reporting, control testing, audit reviews and insurance programs capture lessons learned and support adaptation strategies, enabling the firm to reconfigure resources, preserve functioning and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

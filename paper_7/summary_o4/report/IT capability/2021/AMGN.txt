Amgen’s MD&A discloses multiple practices and investments that support its capacity to absorb strain and maintain functioning under adversity, including its pandemic response measures—closely monitoring COVID-19 infection rates and variants, implementing remote working arrangements, adhering to government health and safety protocols, supporting uninterrupted global medicine supply, and mitigating effects on clinical trial enrollment—which exemplify business continuity and operational flexibility under external disruptions. The company underscores a strategic and disciplined approach to capital allocation and risk mitigation, balancing investment in its innovative pipeline and strategic acquisitions with shareholder returns via dividends and share repurchases, while employing foreign currency and interest rate hedging programs and maintaining liquidity through a commercial paper program and revolving credit facility. Amgen further highlights its commitment to organizational capabilities and adaptability through human capital management—programs designed to attract, motivate, develop and retain talent, foster a diverse and inclusive culture to spur innovation, and set and achieve long-term environmental sustainability targets—and through targeted expansion of manufacturing capacity and resource deployment. Its structured R&D investment across research and early pipeline, later-stage clinical programs and marketed products, together with contingent consideration arrangements for collaborations and acquisitions, reflect a systematic perspective on resource generation, risk assessment and reconfiguration of strategic initiatives to preserve performance and support resilience in a volatile healthcare environment.

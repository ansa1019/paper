Nike’s strategic narrative reflects a multifaceted approach to organizational resilience, beginning with its fiscal 2018 consumer direct offense and triple-double strategy to double innovation impact, accelerate speed and agility to market, and deepen direct connections with consumers, and evolving in June 2020 into a consumer direct acceleration phase centered on more seamless premium marketplace experiences, a realigned product creation model around consumer constructs, simplified operating models for reinvestment in high-growth segments, and unified investments in data and analytics, demand sensing, inventory management and an end-to-end technology foundation. In July 2020 management implemented leadership and operating model changes to streamline execution, resulting in workforce realignment and expected reinvestment of wage-related savings, while the company’s pandemic response exemplified resilience through rapid adaptation to temporary store closures, supply-chain disruptions from container shortages and port congestion, maintaining operating continuity via Nike-owned digital platforms and store footprints, preserving liquidity of $13.5 billion, and adjusting operating plans in response to evolving public health guidance. Nike further demonstrated resourcefulness and adaptability by transitioning key Latin America markets to distributor models to enhance profitability, suspending and resuming share repurchases in line with cash-flow realities, and leveraging a centralized foreign-exchange risk management program to mitigate currency fluctuations. Across wholesale and direct channels, the company reconfigured resource allocation, optimized full-price margins, annualized lower factory cancellation and obsolescence charges, and accelerated digital transformation to safeguard performance, manage external pressures and emerge stronger from adversity.

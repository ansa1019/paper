We caution that the statements regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations, underscoring the importance of robust risk mitigation and adaptive strategies. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet short‐ and long‐term obligations while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility, deploying cash flows from regulated and nonregulated subsidiaries, commercial paper issuances and committed credit facilities to support operating and strategic initiatives—including acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt repayment and shareholder distributions—to preserve organizational integrity and performance under pressure. We take a prudent, market‐sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships, balancing growth and profitability across dimensions such as product positioning, price competitiveness and regulatory considerations, and intensify medical and operating cost management by adjusting care provider networks, member benefits and premiums to partially offset funding pressures. We engage physicians and consumers with information to mitigate medical cost trends, leverage our data and analytics in collaboration with clinicians to close gaps in care and improve health outcomes, and invest in new clinical and administrative information and management systems to coordinate care under performance‐based payment models. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expanded benefit coverage for related care and testing, telemedicine and pharmacy services, assisted customers, care providers, members and communities in addressing the crisis, and managed the dynamic situation of temporary care deferrals and increased care costs while recognizing that ongoing uncertainty may continue to influence consumer behavior, medical cost reserve development and health system capacity. Our processes for estimating medical costs payable employ completion factors and per-member per-month trend analyses, incorporate near-term completion factors informed by historical experience and current trends, and are subject to sensitivity analyses to assess the impacts of variations in claim submission rates and cost trends on reserves and net earnings. We evaluate goodwill for impairment through qualitative and quantitative analyses, measuring reporting unit fair values using discounted cash flows and market multiples, applying assumptions about revenue and cost trends, discount rates and terminal growth rates, and conducting sensitivity analyses on key inputs. We manage concentrations of credit risk through board-authorized investment policies that limit issuer exposure and maintain diversified receivables across a broad customer base. These strategic, operational and financial measures reflect our systematic approach to resource allocation, risk assessment, adaptability and performance maintenance in the face of external pressures and disruptive events.

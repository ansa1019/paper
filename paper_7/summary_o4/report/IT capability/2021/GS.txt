Our disclosures emphasize that our business continuity planning (BCP) strategy, information security program, risk management and liquidity policies are integral to sustaining operations under challenging conditions and preserving firm performance. We have implemented a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework, overseen by the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee and supported by dedicated risk committees, to identify, assess and manage operational, market, credit, liquidity and model risks. This framework incorporates regular stress testing and scenario analysis, limit and threshold setting, independent monitoring and escalation protocols, and a formal Contingency Funding Plan that pre-funds potential cash and collateral needs and assigns clear responsibilities for crisis response. We maintain high-quality liquid assets (GCLA) calibrated to 30-day severe stress outflows, diversified funding sources with term-appropriate maturities, and a quarterly balance sheet plan to dynamically manage asset-liability composition. The Firmwide Operational Risk and Resilience Committee, alongside our Cybersecurity, Third-Party Risk and Business Resilience forums, governs policies and recovery objectives to ensure business and operational resilience, enable safe return to our offices amid COVID-19, and support continuous operations without reliance on external funding support.

During fiscal 2022 the company maintained positive adjustment under challenging conditions by keeping its U.S. stores and all e-commerce businesses open despite government-mandated temporary closures in Europe, Canada and Australia that aggregated to approximately 4% of operating days (versus 24% in fiscal 2021), driving significantly improved year-over-year results; management reconstituted its comparable store sales metrics to “open-only” measures to reflect disrupted operations, demonstrating operational flexibility and future orientation, and continued to monitor health and safety developments for associates and customers as part of its crisis response and emergency management framework. The company invested in distribution capacity, increased wages and incurred higher freight and supply chain costs to rebuild inventories and preserve performance under adversity, while routinely entering into currency hedges to mitigate transactional foreign exchange risk, illustrating resource reconfiguration, risk mitigation mechanisms and system resilience aimed at preserving integrity and performance amid external disturbances. Liquidity and capital resources were actively managed through maintaining cash and credit facilities adequate for operating needs, selectively repaying and refinancing long-term debt—including make-whole calls to reduce interest costs—and lifting the temporary suspension of its share repurchase program and resuming dividend payments, all of which exemplify strategic agility, resource allocation and organizational capabilities designed to absorb strain and support business continuity in a volatile environment.

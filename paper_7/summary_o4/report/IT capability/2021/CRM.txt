In response to the Covid-19 pandemic’s creation of significant economic uncertainty and operational disruption, we launched our Success From Anywhere initiative and leveraged flex-team agreements to enable periodic in-person collaboration and remote work, using Slack as a digital headquarters to connect, share information and maintain continuity of operations, while recognizing potential incremental costs to improve employees’ ability to work from home and impairments associated with exiting select real estate leases. We continue to reinvest a significant portion of income from operations in future periods to grow and innovate our business and service offerings, driving innovation both organically and through acquisitions, evaluating complementary businesses, services, technologies and intellectual property to expand our ecosystem, and supporting adoption of our offerings through professional services investments that facilitate customer success. To position for long-term growth, we periodically make changes to our sales organization, which can cause temporary disruptions to sales productivity, and we have experienced, and may experience, greater variation in new business activity due to longer, less predictable sales cycles, an expanded product mix and the integration of acquired businesses. The expanding global scope of our business and heightened volatility in markets—including pandemic-related pressures, inflation and geopolitical events—expose us to foreign currency fluctuations and seasonal patterns that could materially affect our results and our ability to accurately forecast future performance. We believe our existing liquidity—comprising cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $10.5 billion, accounts receivable, unbilled contract amounts and an available $3.0 billion revolving credit facility—is sufficient to meet working capital, capital expenditure and debt maintenance needs over the next 12 months, although future acquisitions or investments may require additional equity or debt financing. Our commitments for office, data center and infrastructure service leases, totaling $5.8 billion over varying terms, are expected to be funded by cash on hand and operating cash flows, and we continue to invest in infrastructure upgrades and system replacements to scale operations, enhance security and maintain operational flexibility in response to evolving business requirements.

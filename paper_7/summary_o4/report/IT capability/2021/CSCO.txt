In fiscal 2021, despite the highly challenging macroeconomic and competitive environment exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, we delivered revenue growth and maintained operational momentum by aggressively investing in priority areas to drive long-term profitable growth. As customers accelerated digitization and cloud investments, we focused on executing and innovating to support their transition, while supporting organization-wide adaptation through a restructuring plan—including a voluntary early retirement program—to realign resources, generate approximately $1.0 billion in annualized cost savings, and enable further strategic investments. We reinforced supply chain resilience by partnering with key suppliers to leverage volume purchasing, extend supply coverage, and revise supplier arrangements to mitigate semiconductor shortages and optimize access to critical components, actions expected to continue through at least the first half of fiscal 2022. During this extraordinary time, our priority has been supporting employees, customers, partners, and communities while positioning Cisco for the future, including moving towards a hybrid work model, providing free trials of Webex and security technologies, and committing significant funds to global and local pandemic response efforts. Our strategy to help customers connect, secure, and automate across private, hybrid, and multicloud environments underscores our emphasis on digital agility, systemic coordination, and resilience engineering. We have maintained robust liquidity and financial flexibility—with cash, investments, and committed credit lines sufficient to satisfy anticipated requirements through at least the next 12 months—and have allocated free cash flow to strategic acquisitions, research and development, share repurchases, and dividends in support of ongoing business continuity and organizational resilience.

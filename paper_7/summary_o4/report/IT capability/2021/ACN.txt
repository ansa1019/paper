In fiscal 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact our business operations and financial results, and we saw strong demand as customers accelerated their digital transformation, including application modernization and maintenance, cloud enablement and managed security services. We help our clients build their digital core, transform their operations through data and analytics, automation and artificial intelligence, and accelerate revenue growthâ€”creating tangible value across their enterprises at speed and scale. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in anticipated client demand, evaluating voluntary attrition, adjusting levels of new hiring, using involuntary terminations and adjusting compensation by skill set and geography to maintain an appropriate supply of skills and resources. We strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of people to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our margins and manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as related revenues through contractual protections and hedging programs. We believe our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, if necessary, our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities, and substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds.

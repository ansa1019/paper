Management’s discussion highlights that the Company’s merchant acceptance, fintech and payments services are largely non-discretionary and necessary for clients’ business continuity, reflecting an operational design to preserve functioning under adverse conditions; we actively review and reconfigure our portfolio through strategic acquisitions and divestitures to align assets with evolving market demands and resource needs; our enterprise priorities stress disciplined capital allocation, enhanced operational effectiveness and targeted innovation to maintain performance under external pressures; in response to the COVID-19 pandemic we implemented extensive safety protocols, travel restrictions and vaccination requirements to mitigate hazards and sustain continuity; we have realized cost synergies, strong operating leverage and efficiency improvements post-acquisition to bolster flexibility and resilience; we maintain $835 million of cash and cash equivalents, $1.6 billion of available revolving credit facility capacity, $1.8 billion of capacity under commercial paper programs and a receivables-securitization borrowing to ensure liquidity for day-to-day operations, debt service, capital expenditures and strategic investments; our investment-grade credit ratings (BAA2/BBB) support access to long-term debt markets and limit financing cost volatility; and we guarantee and securitize certain receivables and joint-venture facilities to reinforce our capacity to absorb strain, manage risk and preserve performance across nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

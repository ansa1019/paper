Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, management has activated a global crisis management team to protect employees and customers, optimize operations, secure the supply chain and execute comprehensive business continuity plans—establishing a medical advisory group for employees, leveraging work-from-home infrastructure to facilitate social distancing and accelerating remote physician support—while monitoring return-to-office strategies based on science and data; proactive cost-reduction measures, amendment of financial covenants, enhanced liquidity through a new $2.75 billion revolving credit facility and disciplined cash investments with counterparty diversification have underpinned the company’s ability to fund operations, service debt and support customers as healthcare systems recover; ongoing investments in research and development, environmental, social and governance initiatives—including certification to ISO 50001, 14001 and 45001, leadership in energy and environmental design buildings and a goal of carbon neutrality by 2030—together with rigorous internal controls for cybersecurity risk, legal and product-liability accrual methodologies, goodwill and intangible-asset impairment testing, contingent consideration valuation, and tax reserve practices, reflect a systemic, multifaceted approach to risk mitigation, strategic agility and preservation of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

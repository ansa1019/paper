In response to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has prioritized the safety of its employees, clients and communities by adopting a phased approach to office reopenings and maintaining remote work arrangements while engaging in continuous risk assessment and stakeholder communication to navigate these challenging conditions. Visa’s liquidity and capital management framework, governed by treasury policies designed to support operating expenditures, payment settlement, litigation obligations, capital investments, dividends and share repurchases, is structured to ensure business continuity and resilience by maintaining cash and cash equivalents of $16.5 billion, an available-for-sale debt securities portfolio, a $3.0 billion commercial paper program, a $5.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and specialized escrow accounts for litigation risks. The Company actively monitors settlement risk through a global settlement guarantee management process, holding $9.1 billion of its liquidity for potential counterparty failures, regularly limits credit exposures and leverages its high credit ratings to sustain access to capital markets. It has committed to investing in technology assets and payments network infrastructure to reinforce operational flexibility and system integrity, enabling secure, reliable and efficient global transaction processing even under external or internal variations and disturbances. In addition, Visa employs forward-looking financial metrics and judgments—such as the systematic recognition of client incentives based on forecasts of volume, the reassessment of litigation provisions in view of evolving case profiles and the evaluation of uncertain tax positions—to maintain transparency into its operating performance and adapt its financial reporting in accordance with changing legislative and economic environments.

The Company’s disclosures describe its experience of “severe disruptions in the market and the global and United States economies” during the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that travel bans, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns materially and adversely affected its customers, suppliers, vendors, distributors and manufacturing facilities and led to the suspension of elective medical procedures that “negatively affected our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations” through early 2021.  In the second quarter of 2021, the Company observed “partial recovery of elective procedures in most geographies,” though the emergence of the delta and omicron variants “continued to adversely impact elective procedures and increased inflationary pressure on our gross margin, including an increase in freight and transportation costs as well as increased absenteeism.”  To preserve and improve functioning despite these pressures, the Company maintained a capital allocation strategy prioritizing acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases, invested $339 million in acquisitions and entered into a new $2.25 billion revolving credit agreement to extend liquidity through October 2026, while repaying $1.15 billion of long-term debt.  The Company reconfigured its internal reporting structure effective December 31, 2021, changing its reportable business segments “to align to our new internal reporting structure,” and completed targeted acquisitions, including Gauss Surgical, Inc. and a definitive merger agreement to acquire Vocera Communications, Inc., to enhance its product portfolio and technological capabilities.  It recognized asset impairments of $264 million, “primarily as a result of COVID-19-related demand impacts on in-process product development and certain other divestiture and restructuring activities,” and recorded reserves for product recalls and legal contingencies, representing the minimum of the range of probable loss, while noting that “the final outcome of these matters is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict” and could materially affect future operations.  The Company emphasizes its ability to generate substantial cash from operations—$3.3 billion in 2021—and its “high quality” financial condition, supplementing operating cash flow with access to debt markets “at competitive rates despite the COVID-19 pandemic,” maintaining investment-grade ratings, and expecting to support short-term liquidity from operations, commercial paper and credit lines.  It employs non-GAAP measures to monitor core trends by excluding items such as acquisition and integration-related costs, intangible amortization, restructuring charges and recall matters, which management uses to assess operational performance and guide strategic resource allocation, risk mitigation and long-term planning under challenging conditions.

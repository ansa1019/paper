In its MD&A the company outlines strategies and resource allocations to maintain continuity and safeguard performance under environmental perturbations and market disturbances, including significant investments in plant in service and property additions – such as solar generation, transmission and distribution expansions and the repowering of wind capacity – to adapt to evolving customer demand and regulatory parameters, the use of reserve amortization under the 2016 rate agreement and storm reserves to absorb incremental hurricane and storm restoration costs without imposing surcharges, and the deferral and recovery of fuel, environmental and storm-related expenditures through cost recovery clauses. The company employs energy derivative instruments, including non-qualifying hedges, to mitigate commodity price volatility and optimize generation economics, while routinely measuring value-at-risk for commodity, interest rate and equity price exposures, thereby enhancing operational flexibility and systemic resilience. Liquidity management encompasses diversified funding from operating cash flows, short- and long-term borrowings under syndicated and bilateral credit facilities, proceeds from asset sales and differential membership interests, subject to covenant requirements and credit rating maintenance, alongside guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds to support project-level obligations, trading activities and inter-organizational commitments, thus preserving system integrity and business continuity. Additional resilience actions include the acquisition and integration of regulated transmission utilities (Gridliance), the merger of FPL and Gulf Power under a unified regulatory framework, proactive sales of renewable generation interests to reconstitute capital trajectories, the evaluation and impairment of long-lived assets and equity method investments (including the Mountain Valley Pipeline impairment and increased bad debt related to the February 2021 Texas weather event), and the recognition of asset retirement obligations and regulatory assets and liabilities to fund and recover future decommissioning and dismantlement costs. The company also evaluates pension plan funding and actuarial assumptions to sustain workforce capabilities, applies replacement capital covenants to maintain capital structure health, and executes strategic measures to reconfigure operational trajectories toward future objectives, consistent with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

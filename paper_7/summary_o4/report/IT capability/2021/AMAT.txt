As the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in 2020, Applied Materials responded quickly to put in place precautionary measures to keep its workplaces healthy and safe while ensuring compliance with government orders and restrictions worldwide; its top priority remained protecting the health and safety of employees, customers, suppliers and communities by supporting workplace flexibility such as remote working, enhanced safety and health protocols—including screenings, social distancing and use of personal protective equipment—keeping labs and operations active to support customers, and implementing a multi-phase plan to return to on-site work that takes into account business and employee needs, local regulations, community case trends and public health recommendations, with ongoing monitoring and evaluation to respond appropriately to the impact of COVID-19. In response to evolving conditions, the company made adjustments to its global operations and actively managed its responses in collaboration with employees, customers and suppliers, while recognizing that the situation remains fluid and uncertain and making management of near-term supply chain constraints a top priority. To maintain liquidity and support operational continuity, Applied regularly monitors credit risk in its investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures, including the sale of certain securities, maintains agreements to sell accounts receivable and discount letters of credit to manage working capital, and believes that cash generated from operations, together with existing cash balances and borrowing capacity under committed credit facilities and back-stopped commercial paper and senior unsecured notes, will be sufficient to satisfy liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months. The company’s resource allocation framework includes unsecured revolving credit facilities, senior unsecured note issuances, a commercial paper program, and parent guarantees for letters of credit, while capital deployment decisions—such as common stock repurchases, dividend payments and severance and restructuring actions—remain subject to board approval and aligned with business conditions. To support long-term resilience and competitive advantage, Applied continues significant investments in research, development and engineering across its semiconductor systems and display segments—including new unit process systems, integrated materials solutions, etch, deposition, inspection, patterning and packaging technologies—to deliver innovative products ahead of demand, works closely with global customers to design systems and processes that meet planned technical and production requirements, and evaluates purchase obligations, operating leases and other contractual commitments to align future cash outflows with strategic priorities. In addition, the company maintains critical accounting policies and estimates—such as revenue recognition judgments, warranty cost provisions, allowance for credit losses, inventory valuation, goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing and income tax provisions—to preserve financial integrity and performance under variable industry conditions and external disturbances.

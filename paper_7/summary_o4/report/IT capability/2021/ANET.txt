Arista Networks describes a highly variable operating environment in which the timing and concentration of large customer orders have been unpredictable—driven by changing demand patterns, evaluation and qualification cycles, and the complexity of large orders—leading the company to expect continued variability in customer concentration and the timing of sales. The company acknowledges that its future success depends on its ability to evolve and adapt to a rapidly changing environment by continuing to develop market-leading products and features that address existing and new customer needs, expanding its sales force, marketing activities and partner relationships to reach new end customers more effectively, and investing in research and development to enhance the functionality of its cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features, and leverage its software programmability to integrate rapidly with third-party applications. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic’s component shortages, supply chain constraints, workforce disruptions and governmental restrictions, Arista closed its global offices to protect employees, imposed travel restrictions, worked closely with contract manufacturers and supply chain partners, funded additional working capital, increased purchase commitments and expanded its inventory forecasts to mitigate the impact of delays and preserve its ability to supply products on a timely basis, while acknowledging that further disruptions could negatively affect its business. The company further manages its operational flexibility and resilience by maintaining significant balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities—held for general business purposes and long-term growth—believing these resources, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements and growth strategies for at least the next 12 months, and by tracking material cash requirements such as operating leases, purchase obligations for non-cancellable, non-returnable commitments, and long-term tax payables to maintain continuity and performance under challenging conditions.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company adopted a series of resilience strategies designed to maintain operational continuity and preserve organizational health, including requiring vaccinations for U.S. and Puerto Rico employees, proactively using mitigation plans to ensure the continued supply of life-saving medicines, conducting regular deep cleaning of sites, assessing the need for weekly asymptomatic testing, mask wearing and physical distancing, and maintaining on-site manufacturing personnel to prevent disruptions. Guided by principles of serving patient and customer needs, prioritizing health and safety, following medical advice, leading with compassion and flexibility and modeling key learnings, the company has taken a thoughtful and phased approach to bringing its workforce back to more than 195 sites globally, monitoring local conditions and government direction closely and adjusting plans as appropriate. Patient support programs were expanded to help eligible patients who lost employment and health insurance due to the pandemic, and remote interactions have been employed to ensure ongoing support for healthcare professionals, patient care and access to medicines across global markets. To bolster its capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adversity, the company is expanding its cell therapy portfolio by constructing new state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Devens, Massachusetts, and Leiden, Netherlands, and has driven capital expenditures in connection with the expansion of its cell therapy and other manufacturing capabilities, research and development and other facility-related activities. Through an operating model transformation and Celgene acquisition restructuring activities, the company has streamlined its legal entity structure, leaned administrative functions, strengthened its R&D capabilities in tumor biology, patient selection and new biomarkers, and realized approximately $3.0 billion of synergies to date; this disciplined approach to marketing, selling and administrative expenses, together with investments in biologics manufacturing infrastructure and continuous improvement initiatives, supports strategic, financial and operational flexibility and enables the organization to adapt to external pressures, reconfigure resources and maintain performance under challenging conditions.

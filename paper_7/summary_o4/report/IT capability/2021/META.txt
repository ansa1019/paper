In our management’s discussion and analysis, we disclose our forward-looking statements reflecting plans, estimates, and beliefs, and identify risk factors in Item 1A to address uncertainties that could materially affect our ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. We have experienced and continue to manage the operational disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, including initial business slowdowns and subsequent increases in active user engagement and advertising demand, and we acknowledge the volatility of these trends and our inability to predict future impacts with certainty. To support business continuity and operational flexibility, we anticipate significant investments in data center capacity, network infrastructure, office facilities and headcount scaling, particularly in our Reality Labs initiatives, with capital expenditures expected to range from $29–34 billion in 2022. In response to regulatory environment changes, third-party platform limitations and competitive pressures, we have introduced new ad-product features such as Reels, and caution that future advertising revenue growth may continue to be adversely affected by evolving privacy and measurement constraints. We employ non-GAAP measures, including constant currency revenue and free cash flow reconciled to GAAP, to enhance transparency, support performance maintenance and enable resource allocation decisions amidst external perturbations. Our critical accounting policies and estimates—such as revenue recognition judgments, impairment testing of goodwill and long-lived assets, valuation of equity investments, uncertain tax positions, and legal contingencies—are reviewed regularly, with reserves and disclosures adjusted as new information arises to mitigate risks and preserve financial integrity. We maintain robust liquidity, with $48 billion of cash and marketable securities as of December 31, 2021, and anticipate our existing cash flow and authorized share repurchase program will sufficiently support operations, contractual commitments—including operating and finance lease obligations—and our strategic objectives through the foreseeable future. Our review of foreign exchange exposures and seasonality in advertising demand, combined with rigorous evaluation of management’s share-based compensation elections, transition tax, tax planning and contractual commitments, demonstrates our systemic perspective on risk assessment and resource reconfiguration to preserve organizational strength, adaptability and performance under both nominal and extreme conditions.

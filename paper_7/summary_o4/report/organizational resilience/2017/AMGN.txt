In 2017, we continued to provide an uninterrupted supply of medicines for patients around the world while responding to natural disasters and investing for the future; in September, Hurricane Maria caused widespread damage to Puerto Rico, but critical manufacturing areas of our Juncos facility were not significantly impacted and we resumed full operations. We made investments in next-generation biomanufacturing that reduce scale and costs while retaining a reliable, high-quality, compliant supply of medicines, and we further optimized our business and operating model through significant transformation and process improvement efforts that enable us to reallocate resources to fund innovative pipeline and growth opportunities and deliver long-term value. Since 2014, these efforts have established a more agile and efficient operating model, realized approximately $1.5 billion of savings and laid a foundation for growth. Operating expenses decreased 2% as all categories benefited from these savings, and our foreign-currency hedging activities helped offset the impact of exchange-rate fluctuations. Cash flows from operating activities grew 8% to $11.2 billion, enabling investments for the future and returns to shareholders, and we expanded transformation activities and savings initiatives to support both new product investment and defense of existing products. We now have global access to our $41.7 billion balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, unlocking additional financial flexibility, and we believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and available financing options are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, dividends, stock repurchases and strategic transactions.

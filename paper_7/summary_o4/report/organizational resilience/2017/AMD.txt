During 2017, we launched more than 40 new high-performance CPUs and GPUs, re-shaped our product portfolio and improved our technology competitiveness by transitioning to our new Radeon GPU and Ryzen desktop processor products, which reflects our ability to anticipate market dynamics, reconfigure resources and maintain performance under challenging market conditions. We regularly evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including inventory valuation based on historical sales, projected demand and obsolescence, and goodwill impairment through qualitative and quantitative analyses that consider industry prospects, market capitalization and managementâ€™s discounted cash flow projections, thereby enabling positive adjustment under internal and external variations. Our critical accounting estimates, including assessment of deferred tax asset recoverability using prudent tax planning strategies and evaluation of revenue allowances based on historical trends, illustrate our resilience in preserving organizational integrity and financial flexibility in the face of regulatory changes such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. We have undertaken strategic restructuring plans in 2014 and 2015 to simplify our business, reduce global headcount and optimize our real estate footprint, and we exited the dense server systems business to sharpen our investment focus, demonstrating adaptive strategies and resource reconfiguration toward major objectives. Strategic collaborations and inter-organizational partnerships, including our wafer supply agreement with GlobalFoundries and its sixth amendment to establish a technology collaboration framework for advanced nodes, our formation of the ATMP joint venture and the THATIC intellectual property joint venture, further underpin our systemic perspective, resource deployment flexibility and crisis management capabilities to secure supply continuity and drive innovation. We maintain operational flexibility through amendments to our secured revolving credit facility, extending maturity dates, adjusting borrowing bases and supply chain finance arrangements to ensure ongoing access to liquidity. Our management team monitors segment net revenue and operating income to gauge performance under pressure, and we employ strategic investments in research and development and sales and marketing activities, funded in part by cash flow from operations and supplemented by debt issuances and repurchases, to support business continuity, adaptability and competitive advantage in a turbulent business environment.

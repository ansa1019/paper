In 2017 management reaffirmed its capital allocation strategy—prioritizing acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases—while reporting net sales growth of 9.9% (7.1% organic in constant currency) and investing $831 million in acquisitions, actions reflecting dynamic resource allocation and strategic agility. The Company managed a voluntary product recall in response to an FDA warning letter by discontinuing third-party supply, reconfiguring manufacturing in-house, resuming shipments in October and returning to full supply capacity by the end of 2017, thereby demonstrating operational flexibility and business continuity under adversity. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 65.7% from 66.2% in 2016 primarily due to the impact from restructuring-related charges, the impact of hurricanes, unfavorable mix and inflation, partially offset by higher sales volumes, increased productivity and favorable impact of foreign currency exchange, exemplifying partial maintenance of performance under environmental perturbations. Continued focus on operating expense improvement initiatives, cost containment and leverage from acquisitions supports organizational health, while capital expenditures associated with the development of a global ERP system and investments in new and existing plants and equipment underpin system resilience and support sales growth. Liquidity is maintained via substantial cash provided by operations, supplemented as necessary with debt, including senior unsecured notes and commercial paper, under a global cash management strategy that addresses liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations, enabling the Company to fund operating needs, capital projects, acquisitions and recall-related payments. Management’s evaluation of legal, tax and pension contingencies—reflected in reserves for product liability, uncertain income tax positions and underfunded defined benefit pension plans—alongside contractual obligations disclosures, illustrates comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation to preserve system integrity. Annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, and reviews of other long-lived assets for recoverability based on discounted cash flow analyses, further reinforce the Company’s adaptability and capacity to maintain performance and integrity when confronted with macroeconomic and operational disturbances.

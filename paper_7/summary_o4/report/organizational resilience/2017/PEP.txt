PepsiCo’s filings describe how the Company maintains its performance under challenging conditions by continuously monitoring internal and external pressures—unstable economic, political and social environments, civil unrest, natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, debt and credit issues, and currency fluctuations—and identifying and implementing actions to mitigate any unfavorable impacts on its results, thereby ensuring business continuity and operational flexibility. Management’s discussion highlights strategic initiatives designed to adapt to disruptive change—leveraging the strength of its distribution system to meet shifting consumer needs, strengthening retail and foodservice relationships, minimizing environmental footprint to streamline costs, investing in its associates for long-term growth, and expanding e-commerce and digital solutions—to preserve or improve functioning despite adversity. The Company has instituted an integrated risk-management framework, with board and committee oversight, a cross-functional senior risk committee, country- and division-level risk committees, a centralized risk management office, corporate audit and a compliance and ethics department, to identify, assess, prioritize, address, manage, monitor and communicate key risks across operations. In parallel, PepsiCo pursues productivity initiatives and global purchasing programs, employs commodity hedging and foreign-exchange derivatives, and maintains diversified liquidity sources—cash from operations, commercial paper programs, revolving credit facilities and long-term debt—to absorb strain, reconfigure resources and preserve system integrity and financial resilience. The Company further underscores its ability to respond effectively to regulatory and tax changes—such as the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the provision for transition taxes on undistributed international earnings, and the remeasurement of deferred taxes—through ongoing impact assessments, adjustments to estimates and structured payment planning, all of which support sustained performance and long-term adaptive capability.

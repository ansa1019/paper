Management has instituted a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework encompassing risk identification, assessment, measurement, monitoring, reporting and mitigation to ensure the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adverse internal or external variations. Approved by the board and overseen by dedicated subcommittees, this framework defines risk appetite across operational, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, model, fiduciary and legal domains, assigns clear accountability to business and control units, and incorporates periodic control self-assessments, testing programs and internal audits. A robust information security program, geographically dispersed backup and recovery infrastructure, routine testing of business continuity and disaster-recovery plans, and contractual provisions for third-party risk combine to maintain operational continuity and rapid response to disruptive events. Schwab actively manages interest-rate, funding and balance-sheet sensitivities through established guidelines, net interest revenue simulations and liquidity stress tests, while maintaining diversified funding sources, capital stress-testing and contingency plans. Policies for model governance, collateral risk, credit underwriting, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and fiduciary obligations further reinforce controls, and senior management’s ongoing monitoring and strategic foresight maintain performance and competitive advantage through volatile, challenging and exceptional conditions.

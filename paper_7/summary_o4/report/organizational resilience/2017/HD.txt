In fiscal 2017, the Company demonstrated its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity by responding to three hurricanes that impacted its operations in the continental U.S., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands—recording approximately $662 million of hurricane-related sales at below-average margins and incurring $170 million of related expenses—while maintaining business continuity; generating $12.0 billion of cash flow from operations (an increase of $2.2 billion year-over-year driven by higher comparable sales and expense leverage) and holding $3.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents (of which $3.2 billion was held by foreign subsidiaries); securing liquidity through access to a $3.0 billion commercial paper program with bank back-up facilities, a new five-year $2.0 billion credit facility and a 364-day $1.0 billion facility, which collectively support capital expenditure programs, dividend and share-repurchase commitments and scheduled debt obligations; deploying resources by funding $1.9 billion of capital expenditures and $374 million for acquisitions (Compact Power and The Company Store); executing a $15.0 billion authorization for share repurchases (with $8.0 billion completed) and increasing quarterly dividends by 15.7 percent; using derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies and interest rates; evaluating long-lived assets quarterly at the individual store level for indicators of potential impairment—applying multi-year cash flow projections, market appraisals and sublease income estimates to determine recoverability and reconfigure or close locations when necessary; establishing and reviewing on a regular basis self-insurance liabilities for general liability, workers’ compensation, employee medical and automobile claims based on historical data and actuarial estimates; and valuing inventories under the retail inventory method—with cost-to-retail ratios and markdown, markup and shrink adjustments—to ensure inventories approximate the lower of cost or market and support reliable financial reporting.

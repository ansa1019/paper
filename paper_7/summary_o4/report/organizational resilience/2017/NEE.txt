In September 2017, hurricane Irma passed through Florida causing damage throughout much of FPL’s service territory and cutting electrical service to approximately 4.4 million customers; FPL restored power to about 50 percent of affected customers within one day and to approximately 95 percent within seven days, reflecting its operational flexibility, crisis management protocols and business continuity capabilities to absorb strain and preserve functioning under extreme conditions. Following the December 2017 enactment of tax reform, FPL elected not to seek recovery of Irma storm restoration costs through customer surcharges, instead using available reserve amortization permitted under the 2016 rate agreement and planning to replenish those reserves via future tax savings, demonstrating adaptive resource allocation, strategic financial response and risk mitigation under regulatory constraints. FPL’s use of cost recovery clauses, reserve amortization mechanics and tariff structures to maintain its targeted regulatory return on equity illustrates its systemic perspective and capacity for positive adjustment amid regulatory and environmental pressures. Across its businesses, NEE maintains approximately $9.2 billion in net available liquidity through revolving credit facilities, commercial paper issuances and cash balances, ensuring funds to support working capital, capital expenditures and capital structure stability in volatile markets. NEE and its subsidiaries employ comprehensive risk management, including fuel and energy derivative hedges, interest rate swaps and credit limit policies reinforced by master netting agreements and value‐at‐risk modeling, to monitor and mitigate market, commodity price and credit exposures, underscoring dynamic capabilities to respond to internal and external disturbances. The maintenance of investment grade credit ratings and adherence to covenant requirements enable timely access to capital markets and provide a financial buffer against adversity. Capital investment strategies—such as continued investments in plant in service, transmission and distribution additions, repowering of wind capacity and incremental solar projects—underscore NEE’s commitment to adaptability, innovation and performance maintenance under challenging conditions. The establishment of special use funds for nuclear decommissioning and storm recovery, alongside the accrual and funding of asset retirement obligations, exemplifies proactive planning, long-term resource generation and organizational foresight to manage hazards and sustain integrity over extended temporal trajectories.

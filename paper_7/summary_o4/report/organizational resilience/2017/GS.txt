Goldman Sachs has implemented an enterprise risk management framework approved by the board and its committees and led by independent control and support functions that are accountable for identifying, assessing, monitoring and managing liquidity, market, credit, operational and model risks. The firm’s forward-looking statements highlight the objectives and effectiveness of its business continuity plan, information security program, risk management and liquidity policies, as well as its resolution plan and resolution strategy, including resolution capital and liquidity models and a triggers and alerts framework, to ensure operational continuity under challenging conditions. A comprehensive capital management policy incorporates a forward-looking capital planning and stress‐testing process, including annual CCAR and DFAST scenarios, an internal severely adverse scenario, a contingency capital plan and resolution capital adequacy and positioning (RCAP) and resolution liquidity adequacy and positioning (RLAP) models, all designed to maintain sufficient loss‐absorbing capacity and enable continued operation in times of financial stress. To manage liquidity risk, the firm holds pre-funded global core liquid assets (GCLA), maintains diversified secured and unsecured funding with appropriate tenors consistent with its assessed liquidity needs over 30 days and intraday horizons, and operates a detailed contingency funding plan outlining roles, decision protocols and secondary funding sources to address cash and collateral outflows in both firm-specific and market-wide stress. Credit risk is controlled through rigorous counterparty credit reviews, risk limits by industry, issuer and region, recovery measures such as enforceable netting and collateral arrangements, and stress tests that capture sovereign and corporate credit deterioration. Market risk is monitored via daily Value-at-Risk and a range of sensitivity and scenario analyses across interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. Operational risk is mitigated by a formalized control framework, including self-assessments, policies, process mapping, loss event tracking and internal audits, while model risk management provides independent review, validation and approval of all significant valuation and risk models. Through regular training, escalation protocols, dynamic balance sheet management and governance structures that integrate senior management and committee oversight, the firm preserves its integrity and performance, absorbing strain and adapting to unexpected or extreme conditions.

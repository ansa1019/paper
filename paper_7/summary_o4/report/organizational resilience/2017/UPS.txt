In 2017, UPS recognized the impacts from natural disasters, capacity constraints arising from volume surges and operating costs associated with facility construction and the deployment of expanded Saturday operations, illustrating the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve performance under challenging conditions. The company drove growth through shipment growth, yield expansion and benefits from network investments and portfolio initiatives while continually adjusting its air and ground networks to better match higher volume levels and deploying technology—such as ORION route-optimization—to increase package sorting and delivery productivity. To mitigate external pressures and support business continuity, management supplements GAAP financial reporting with non-GAAP measures—such as adjusted operating profit, currency-neutral revenue and effective tax rates—that are used internally for business-unit operating performance analysis, incentive compensation awards and resource allocation decisions, with allocation methodologies refined periodically to reflect changes in the business and to hedge foreign exchange fluctuations. Strategic rate and accessorial changes—including dimensional weight recalculations, peak surcharge implementations and base-rate increases—are designed to offset additional expenses incurred during significant volume surges, while selective acquisitions of Marken and Coyote Logistics, capital expenditure programs for new aircraft, facilities, vehicles and information technology, and the maintenance of liquidity via cash flows, commercial paper programs and long-term debt demonstrate operational flexibility and resourcefulness to preserve or improve functioning despite adversity.

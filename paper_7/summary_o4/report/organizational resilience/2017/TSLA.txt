In 2017, Tesla accelerated its transition to sustainable energy by scaling vehicle production capability by 20% year-over-year, gaining operational efficiencies, and enhancing product offerings through over-the-air software updates to maintain performance under varied conditions, while completing the world’s largest battery installation in South Australia to support grid reliability. Strategic partnerships with Panasonic at Gigafactories 1 and 2 facilitated integrated high-volume production of photovoltaic cells and battery systems, enhancing supply continuity and manufacturing flexibility. As the Model 3 production ramp encountered bottlenecks in battery module assembly, Tesla redirected engineering talent to refine automation processes, systematically addressed constraints, phased capacity expansions (targeting 2,500 units per week by Q1 2018 and 5,000 by Q2), and conditioned further scale-up to 10,000 units on achieving interim run rates to manage uncertainty and preserve integrity. Concurrently, Tesla expanded its global retail, service and charging infrastructure—including new stores, service centers, mobile repair units and superchargers—to sustain operations ahead of growing demand. In its energy generation and storage segment, the Company reduced customer acquisition costs, leveraged channel partnerships, prioritized cash-generating and high-margin projects, and deliberately ramped solar roof production to ensure reliability, anticipating at least a threefold increase in storage sales in 2018. Projected capital expenditures are modestly higher, with the majority directed to Model 3 capacity enhancements, facility investments and network expansion, underpinned by $3.4 billion in cash, $2.0 billion in unused financing commitments and a $5 billion New York investment obligation. Tesla expects these liquidity sources, proceeds from convertible senior notes and senior notes issuances, bond hedges, and cash flows from operations to support at least 12 months of operations, while remaining prepared to raise additional capital as needed to absorb strain, mitigate risks, and preserve functional performance amid internal and external pressures.

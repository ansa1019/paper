Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities and manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis; there are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses, while our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the chief executive to head each of the operating businesses. We believe that investment and derivative gains and losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported results or evaluating our periodic economic performance, although investment and derivative gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our earnings. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses; generally, we consider pre-tax catastrophe losses in excess of $100 million from a current year event as significant, and underwriting results for 2017 included estimated pre-tax losses of approximately $3.0 billion, primarily attributable to hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, an earthquake in Mexico, a cyclone in Australia and wildfires in California, while underwriting results in each year also included after-tax foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses from the revaluation of certain non-U.S. dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities. At the inception of the aggregate excess-of-loss retroactive reinsurance agreement with subsidiaries of AIG, we recorded losses and loss adjustment expenses of $10.2 billion and a deferred charge asset of $6.2 billion, resulting in no effect on our pre-tax underwriting results; in the fourth quarter of 2017 we increased our ultimate claim liability estimates related to the AIG agreement by approximately $1.8 billion based on higher-than-expected loss payments, and increased the related deferred charge asset by $1.7 billion based on our re-estimation of the amount and timing of our recorded liabilities. We continue to hold significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury bills earning low yields, because we believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to such balances. Our float approximated $114 billion at December 31, 2017, with an average cost of float of approximately 3.0%, after fourteen years of negative floats generated by pre-tax underwriting gains. On our railroad and utilities and energy businesses, we forecast capital expenditures of approximately $9.7 billion in 2018 while maintaining strong capital bases and regulatory cost recovery mechanisms, and our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017 reflected shareholdersâ€™ equity of $348.3 billion with operating and financing strategies designed to absorb strain and preserve continuity and performance under internal or external variations and disturbances.

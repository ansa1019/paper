Management’s discussion underscores TJX’s proactive risk mitigation and continuity measures, stating that “forward-looking statements are estimates based on information currently available to the company” and that “the company’s results are subject to risks and uncertainties.” The company “routinely enter[s] into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases,” and continues to “invest and open new distribution centers,” reflecting resource reallocation and supply chain reinforcement. Following a $99.3 million impairment charge, management asserts it “remain[s] confident in the potential of STP and believe[s] [they] are positioned for successful growth going forward,” illustrating adaptability and recovery orientation. In response to external disruptions, “37 stores were significantly impacted by hurricanes … and were excluded from comp sales” until they resume operations, demonstrating event management and resilience. To sustain operational flexibility and business continuity, TJX affirms that “we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and our credit facilities … are more than adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year,” plans approximately $1.4 billion in capital expenditures to support growth, funded by “internally generated funds,” and approved discretionary reinvestments of tax benefits in associate bonuses and retirement contributions. Strategic resource deployment and stakeholder management are further evidenced by a board-authorized repurchase program of up to $3.0 billion of stock, planned repurchases of $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion based on “excess cash flow, liquidity, economic and market conditions,” an expected annual dividend increase of 25%, and $3.0 billion of net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018, collectively reflecting a systemic approach to preserving and enhancing performance under both nominal and extreme variations in the business environment.

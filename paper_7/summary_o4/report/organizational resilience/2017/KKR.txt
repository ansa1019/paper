As a global investment firm, KKR discloses that it must absorb and adapt to myriad external pressures—“global and regional economic conditions have a substantial impact on our financial condition and results of operations, impacting the values of the investments we make, our ability to exit these investments profitably, our ability to raise capital from investors and our ability to make new investments”—and that “periods of volatility and dislocation in the capital markets present substantial risks, but also can present us with opportunities to invest at reduced valuations that position us for future growth and investment returns.” Management recognizes that “greater competition, high valuations, increased overall cost of credit and other general market conditions may impact our ability to identify and execute attractive investments” and that “challenging market and economic conditions may adversely affect our ability to exit and realize value from our investments and result in lower-than-expected returns,” prompting ongoing adjustments to resource deployment, investment strategies and fee models. The firm employs hedging techniques—including foreign currency options and forward contracts—to mitigate “currency volatility,” closely monitors “interest rates, credit spreads and market liquidity,” and acknowledges that “when commodity prices decline or if a decline is not offset by other factors, we would expect the value of our energy real asset investments to be adversely impacted” as it “directly bear[s] the full extent of such gains or losses.” Through a multi-asset, multi-regional platform, dynamic capital allocation across private equity, credit, real assets and capital markets, and the flexibility to consolidate or de-consolidate vehicles in response to regulatory or market shifts, KKR strives to preserve system integrity and maintain performance—at least partially—under varying economic perturbations.

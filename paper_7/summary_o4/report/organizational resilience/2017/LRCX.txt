Lam Research’s management discussion emphasizes the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions through sustained investments in research and development—focused on leading-edge deposition, plasma etch, single-wafer clean and other semiconductor manufacturing requirements—and increased employee headcount, lab maintenance, outside services and supplies to support sustaining engineering, product and process development and concept feasibility programs. The company leverages cycles of learning from its broad installed base and maintains a collaborative focus with ecosystem partners to drive innovation and competitive advantage amid technology inflections such as non-volatile memory, multiple patterning, FinFET and advanced packaging. Recognizing the volatility of the semiconductor industry, management underscores the importance of maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves—$6.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted balances as of June 25, 2017—and anticipates that operating cash flows, together with contractual flexibility under operating leases with extension and purchase options, purchase obligations with limited cancellation fees, and a $750 million revolving credit facility with expansion options, will support operations, capital expenditures, debt service, research and development investments and dividend distributions through varying market conditions. The company’s revenue recognition policies incorporate lapsing customer acceptance periods and allocation among multiple deliverables to mitigate risk, while inventory valuation and warranty reserves are periodically adjusted against forecasts of customer demand and market obsolescence. Critical accounting estimates for long-lived assets and goodwill are subject to annual qualitative and quantitative impairment tests using discounted cash-flow models that reflect macroeconomic factors, forecasted revenues and shifting customer mix, ensuring preparedness to reconfigure resource deployment and preserve or improve functioning in the face of internal or external disturbances.

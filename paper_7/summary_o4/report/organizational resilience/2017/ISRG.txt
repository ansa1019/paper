We generate revenue from initial capital sales of da Vinci surgical systems (including sales-type and operating lease arrangements) and from recurring instrument, accessory, service, and operating lease revenue, reflecting a strategy to allocate resources for business continuity and expand procedure capacity while providing customers with flexible acquisition options. The January 2016 launch of integrated table motion, which coordinates robot arm movements with an advanced operating room table to enable real-time patient positioning without undocking, exemplifies our systemic perspective on operational flexibility and innovation to optimize surgical access, maximize reach, and enhance patient care under evolving procedural demands. Our September 2016 agreement to establish a joint venture with Shanghai Fosun to research, develop, manufacture, and sell robotic-assisted catheter-based medical devices targeting lung cancer diagnosis and treatment illustrates inter-organizational collaboration, resource generation, strategic foresight, and future orientation in developing new capabilities while recognizing upfront investment requirements, ramp-up losses, and regulatory uncertainties. Cash generation is one of our fundamental strengths, providing substantial financial flexibility to meet operating, investing, and financing needs and support strategic initiatives such as international expansion, product development, and infrastructure investments. We have been investing in our business in international markets, driving faster procedure growth outside the U.S., and we expect our OUS procedures and revenue to make up a greater portion of our business in the long term, indicating adaptability to external pressures and shifting market dynamics. Future demand for da Vinci surgical systems will be affected by hospital responses to an evolving healthcare environment, procedure growth rates, consolidation trends, changes in system utilization and point-of-care dynamics, capital replacement cycles, global reimbursement policies, governmental tenders and authorizations, and competitive actions in robotic surgery, reflecting environmental turbulence, risk assessment, and strategic agility. In regulatory activities, we are subject to stringent obligations to correct or remove devices that may pose health risks—including repair, replacement, inspections, relabeling, revised instructions, and training—and regulators can expand or change the scope of these field actions, which may result in reputational harm, customer delays, reduced system utilization, and financial impacts, underscoring our crisis response mechanisms, risk mitigation processes, and organizational resilience in managing hazards. Procedure adoption is modeled by comparing efficacy to invasiveness and cost, and proceeds procedure-by-procedure, market-by-market, driven by relative patient value and total treatment costs, which may shift market share when our procedures offer greater clinical and economic benefits; this dynamic capability to respond to clinical evidence underlines our resilience strategy amid competitive and environmental perturbations. We believe growth in da Vinci hernia repair and other advanced procedures reflects improved clinical outcomes and potential cost benefits, yet we acknowledge variability in adoption timing and extent due to patient population complexity and surgeon preferences, which requires ongoing calibration of strategic initiatives and resource deployment.

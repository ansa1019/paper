Lockheed Martin operates in an environment characterized by increasing complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures, which has led management to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of its products and services, and placing security capabilities quickly and affordably into the hands of U.S. and international customers. Recognizing that customers are resource constrained, the company is disciplining its domestic portfolio expansion into adjacent markets, growing international sales, driving affordability initiatives, and investing in technologies to meet emerging mission requirements while developing and sustaining the technical skills of its workforce. To maintain operational flexibility and business continuity, Lockheed Martin deploys a balanced cash strategy that funds capital expenditures, independent research and development, selective acquisitions and divestitures, dividend payments, share repurchases and substantial pension contributions, all while preserving access to liquidity through revolving credit facilities, commercial paper programs and derivative hedges of foreign‐exchange and interest‐rate exposures. The company manages long‐term contracts under the percentage‐of‐completion method by identifying and monitoring technical, schedule and cost risks, adjusting profit‐booking rates as risks retire or emerge, and recording reserves for performance matters, thereby supporting positive adjustment under challenging conditions. It continuously shapes its portfolio through acquisitions, divestitures and internal realignments; adapts to government funding uncertainties, new accounting standards and tax legislation; and updates its pension and environmental remediation liabilities and recoveries to reflect evolving discount rates, funding requirements and regulatory agreements. These strategic initiatives, risk‐assessment processes and resource reconfigurations reflect a systemic perspective and dynamic capabilities that absorb strain, preserve integrity and sustain performance under internal or external disturbances, consistent with definitions of organizational resilience.

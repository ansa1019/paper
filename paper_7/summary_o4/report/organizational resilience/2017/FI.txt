The company’s management discussion describes a dynamic approach to maintaining performance under external pressures and disturbances through active portfolio management, disciplined capital allocation and targeted acquisitions and dispositions, including four 2017 acquisitions—Obs, PCLender, Dovetail and Monitise—integrated across segments to reconstitute and enhance client solutions, and the disposition of its Australian item processing business, all of which reflect resource reconfiguration and strategic adaptation. Its stated enterprise priorities—“active portfolio management of our businesses, enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships, improving operational effectiveness, being disciplined in our allocation of capital, and differentiating our products and services through innovation”—underscore a systemic perspective on resilience that draws on economies of scale in infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks to justify investments necessary for competitiveness in a challenging operating environment marked by regulatory change and cybersecurity scrutiny. The narrative of financial institutions’ need to invest significant capital and human resources “to process transactions, manage information, maintain regulatory compliance and offer innovative new services” in a rapidly evolving and competitive environment implies absorptive capacity and anticipation of disruptive change. Risk mitigation and integrity-preservation practices are detailed through fair-value purchase price allocations, annual goodwill impairment testing using qualitative and quantitative factors, recoverability assessments of intangible assets based on undiscounted future cash flows and the recording of impairment losses when fair value is exceeded, demonstrating the firm’s ability to absorb strain and preserve performance. Liquidity and capital resource management—reliance on cash flows from operations of $1.48 billion (up 4%), cash and cash equivalents of $325 million, $0.9 billion of available borrowings under a $2 billion revolving credit facility and a $540 million term loan maturing in 2018, compliance with debt covenants limiting leverage and maintaining coverage ratios, and retention of Baa2/BBB credit ratings—illustrates operational flexibility and financial resilience under varying conditions. Share repurchases totaling $1.17 billion in 2017 under authorized programs, combined with disciplined use of debt financing and the absence of off-balance-sheet variable interest entities, further evidences the firm’s capacity to allocate resources effectively, manage risk, and sustain integrity and performance in the face of internal and external variations.

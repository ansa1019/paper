In our selling, general and administrative cost-reduction initiatives, we have implemented end-to-end business process streamlining and automation, including the functional expansion of global shared services and robotic process utilization, and we have forward-accrued service delivery costs and deferred revenue on unfulfilled performance obligations under our Latitude™ patient management system following the modified retrospective adoption of ASC 606; we have increased investment in infrastructure—physical and IT—in emerging markets to maximize growth opportunities; and throughout our operations we have mobilized targeted process-improvement programs that reduced manufacturing costs, optimized inventory step-ups and consolidated redundant roles and facilities, reflecting our focus on coordinating assets and internal processes, integrating resources across functions and leveraging technology-enabled capabilities to support business strategies, enhance operational efficiency and drive strategic alignment.

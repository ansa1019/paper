The company’s digital offerings rest on an expanding IT capability that integrates on-premise and cloud‐based resources into end-to-end workflow solutions, wherein Adobe “provides access to a solution that integrates cloud-based and on-premise/on-device features that, together through their integration, provide functionalities, utility and workflow efficiencies that could not be obtained from either the on-premise/on-device software or cloud services on their own.” Key cloud-hosted functionalities include Creative Cloud libraries for seamless cross‐device access and real-time collaboration, shared reviews enabling simultaneous PDF editing and commentary, automatic cloud rendering to facilitate multi-medium design workflows, and Sensei, Adobe’s AI/ML framework delivering features such as automated photo-editing, content-aware operations, natural language processing and document tagging. Supporting this capability are significant investments in network infrastructure, third-party hosting services and data center facilities, computer equipment and software used in both software development and business administration, and dedicated personnel in network operations, implementation, account management and technical support. The acquisition and integration of marketing cloud and commerce platform companies augment the firm’s technology resources and intangible assets, which are amortized and leveraged to enhance enterprise deployments, data management, connectivity, operational flexibility and information reliability. Research and development spending—comprising software developer compensation, contracted development efforts and related facilities costs—along with professional services, consulting and sales and marketing infrastructure, further mobilizes IT‐based resources to support business strategies, accelerate innovation, tailor solutions to changing business needs, drive market agility and create competitive advantage through enhanced process performance, strategic alignment and digital transformation.

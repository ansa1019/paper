All of our da Vinci surgical systems integrate computational hardware and software with imaging electronics, a surgeon’s 3D high-definition console, a patient-side cart and networked connectivity to provide dependable, consistent functionality and user experiences and to decrease variability in minimally invasive surgery. Our technology is designed to provide surgeons with advanced, computer-aided tools—such as the wristed vessel sealer extend and stapler portfolios—and to filter out tremor inherent in manual techniques, while our holistic, integrated ecosystem of intelligent technologies and systems is engineered to work together to extend the benefits of MIS to a broader patient population. We offer over eighty multi-port instruments and accessories and support them with a comprehensive suite of services, training and education programs, including intuitive simulation products and intuitive telepresence remote case observation and telementoring tools, as well as a dual console for collaborative surgery and proctoring, all of which underscore our competence in mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other organizational capabilities. Our business model leverages flexible sales-type and operating lease arrangements and usage-based pricing—with system and service revenue recognized on a straight-line basis or as systems are utilized—to generate recurring instrument, accessory and service revenues, track system utilization and optimize customer program deployment. The measured roll-out of new platforms—from the flexible, robotic-assisted Ion endoluminal diagnostic system to the Da Vinci SP single-port platform and the Da Vinci Endoscope Plus 3D visualization system and Iris augmented reality service—reflects dynamic capability in aligning our technology resources, training pathways, supply chain and regulatory approvals with evolving clinical needs and market dynamics. Our acquisition of endoscope and visualization assets from Schölly and the planned integration of their global manufacturing operations further exemplify our strategy of combining and reconfiguring IT-enabled resources and capabilities to support innovation, operational flexibility and sustained competitive advantage.

During 2019, the Company continued to enhance and leverage its IT capability by building and operating its proprietary global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) to efficiently stream a high volume of content over the internet, with streaming delivery expenses comprising equipment costs related to Open Connect, payroll for dedicated personnel and third-party cloud computing costs; technology and development expenses increased 26% to $1,545 million, driven by a $305 million rise in compensation and headcount for technology personnel to support service improvements, international expansion and growing content production, as well as by $18 million of additional third-party cloud computing charges, and encompass all costs incurred in testing, maintaining and modifying the user interface, recommendation, merchandising and streaming delivery technology and infrastructure, plus computer hardware and software investments; other purchase obligations of $894 million principally reflect non-cancelable commitments for streaming delivery and cloud computing services, underscoring the firm’s ongoing investment in digital infrastructure and IT resources to support business strategies, operational efficiency and continual enhancements to its streaming service.

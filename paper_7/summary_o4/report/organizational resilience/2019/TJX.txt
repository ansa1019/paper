During fiscal 2020, TJX expanded its digital platform footprint by launching www.marshalls.com alongside existing channels (tjmaxx.com, sierra.com and tkmaxx.com), collectively contributing approximately 2–3% of net sales and reflecting continued investment in IT infrastructure to support customer connectivity, data accuracy and operational efficiency. Incremental systems and technology costs, recorded within SG&A and general corporate expense, underscore the firm’s allocation of technology resources toward enhancing e-commerce, distribution centers and business processes. In response to COVID-19, TJX closed all stores, suspended online operations temporarily and enabled associates to work remotely where possible, leveraging information management capabilities and remote-access systems to maintain critical functions and supply chain continuity. To mitigate Brexit-related regulatory and compliance changes, the company realigned its European supply chain and established dedicated resources and systems, demonstrating the coordination of internal processes and interfirm transactions through technology‐enabled solutions. Adoption of the new lease accounting standard necessitated enhancements to financial reporting systems to recognize operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities, while routine mark-to-market adjustments on inventory-related hedging instruments highlight dependence on data analytics and IT-enabled risk management processes.

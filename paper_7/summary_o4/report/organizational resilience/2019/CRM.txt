Since introducing our first CRM solution in 2000, we have continuously expanded our service offerings with new editions, features and platform capabilities, and our core mission is to enable customers of every size and industry to connect with their customers in new ways through existing and emerging technologies—including cloud, mobile, social, blockchain, voice and artificial intelligence—to transform their businesses. Our Customer 360 platform unites sales, service, marketing, commerce, analytics and more to give a single source of accurate, timely and reliable customer information, reflecting our information management capability. We continue to invest for future growth by focusing on multi-cloud adoption, growing enterprise relationships, expanding internationally and strengthening our ecosystem of partners and independent software vendors, and we regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, services and technologies and intellectual property rights through a disciplined process to expand our service offerings. Cost of revenues includes expenses related to delivering our service and providing support—such as data center capacity costs, third-party technology and data fees, and employee-related costs—and we intend to continue investing additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity to scale with our customers and continuously evolve our security measures. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, stock-based expenses, development and test data center costs and allocated overhead incurred to improve and extend our service offerings, develop new technologies and integrate acquired companies, while marketing and sales expenses reflect the hiring of additional sales personnel to add new customers and deepen penetration in existing accounts. Our contracts with customers often include multiple performance obligations for cloud services, software licenses, premium support and professional services, and we allocate the transaction price to each obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis, demonstrating our competence to coordinate IT and professional services. In addition, our accounting for business combinations such as Tableau, MuleSoft and ClickSoftware requires significant estimates for the fair value of acquired technology assets, customer relationships and other intangibles, underscoring our ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources in support of our business strategy. Finally, our ESG disclosures emphasize robust data security and privacy governance, substantial cybersecurity investments, compliance certifications and tools to help customers manage global regulatory requirements, reinforcing the depth and reliability of our IT infrastructure capability.

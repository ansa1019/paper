Blackstone relies on a sophisticated information management capability to support its business strategies and work processes, preparing consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP and applying a broad set of financial measures and key operating metrics—such as distributable earnings, segment distributable earnings, fee-related earnings, assets under management, fee-earning assets under management, performance-revenue-eligible assets, perpetual capital and dry powder—to coordinate its assets, internal processes and inter-firm relationships and to assess productivity across its four segments.  Valuation of portfolio investments at fair value employs consistent income- and market-based approaches, with internal valuation teams independent from investment teams, annual or quarterly reviews by independent valuation parties, oversight by segment valuation sub-committees and firmwide valuation and audit committees, illustrating the firm’s competence in mobilizing technology resources, data management and analytical methodologies to generate accurate, timely, reliable and secure information.  Detailed tracking of inflows, outflows, realizations, market activity and leverage, together with reconciliations of management and advisory fees, incentive fees, performance allocations, net realizations and adjusted EBITDA, enables dynamic resource deployment, strategic decision-making, operational flexibility and performance linkage in response to evolving market dynamics and regulatory contexts, thereby reinforcing Blackstone’s ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure information-based resources in support and enhancement of its competitive advantage.

The discussion highlights the corporation’s reliance on and enhancement of its digital delivery and processing infrastructure, noting its “leading digital banking platforms (www.bankofamerica.com) with more than 38 million active users, including over 29 million active mobile users,” and describing the launch of new “capabilities to support issuance and trading in products indexed to the new secured overnight financing rate (SOFR).”  It further explains that, in connection with the anticipated discontinuation of LIBOR and other benchmark rates, the corporation “continues to identify, assess and monitor risks … and … modify its operational models, systems, procedures and internal infrastructure to transition to ARRs,” reflecting the expansion and reconfiguration of its technology resources.  At the same time, the report explicitly acknowledges that “a failure or disruption in or breach of the corporation’s operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, including as a result of cyber attacks or campaigns,” could materially affect its business, underscoring the centrality of information security and system reliability to its overall IT capability.

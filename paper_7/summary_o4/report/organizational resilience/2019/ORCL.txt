Oracle provides products and services that address enterprise information technology (IT) environments through flexible and interoperable IT deployment models, including on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid deployments such as Oracle Cloud at Customer, to facilitate the coordination of customers’ assets, internal processes and interfirm transactions and relationships. Our cloud and license business markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of applications and infrastructure technologies through subscription-based Oracle Cloud services, perpetual cloud license and on-premise license offerings, and license support contracts, offering choice and flexibility in product, service and deployment combinations that best suit customers’ needs. To address customer demand and enable customer choice, we have introduced programs for customers to pivot their applications and infrastructure licenses and related support to Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate and expand existing workloads. Our services business helps customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies, differentiated by our focus on Oracle technologies, extensive experience, broad sets of intellectual property and best practices. We expect growth in our cloud services and license support offerings and continued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license offerings to drive future IT investment, enabling continued investments in research and development to develop and improve our cloud and license products and services. Our hardware business, which provides engineered systems, servers, storage and related software, and associated support services, is supported by ongoing research and development investments to improve existing offerings and develop new technologies. We supplement organic development with a selective acquisition program, having invested billions to acquire complementary companies, products, services and technologies, and believe our ability to fund future acquisitions, research and development, capital expenditures and strategic resource allocation will further enhance our IT capability and competitive position in support of evolving business needs and market dynamics.

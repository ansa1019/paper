Management’s discussion and analysis notes that, in response to shifting consumer preferences, a highly competitive operating environment and a rapidly changing retail landscape—“including the growth in e-commerce and mobile commerce applications, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters”—the Company “continue[s] to monitor changes in the retail landscape and to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities, distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.”  The discussion further explains that we aim to be “stronger by continuing to transform our capabilities, cost, and culture by leveraging scale and technology in global markets across our operations and winning locally,” which explicitly includes “developing and scaling core capabilities through technology.”  Finally, in describing our 2019 multi-year productivity plan, management states it “will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint.”

In 2019, AMD executed its multi-year product roadmap and introduced a suite of 7 nm high-performance desktop, notebook, graphics and server processors, reflecting coordinated management of technology development, internal processes and interfirm relationships with major PC manufacturers; revenue is recognized at sell-in with provisions for rights of return and price protection established through analysis of historical sales, market activity and distributor inventory data; ending inventory valuation is routinely assessed for excess quantities and obsolescence using historical sales levels and future demand projections, with lower-of-cost-or-net-realizable-value write-downs applied as necessary; goodwill impairment analysis is performed quarterly, employing qualitative and quantitative factors—including projected cash flows, revenue growth rates, operating margins and discount rates—to determine reporting unit fair values; tax provisioning requires estimates and judgments regarding deferred tax asset recoverability based on past performance, tax planning strategies and anticipated taxable income, as well as the recognition of cross-border withholding taxes; cash-flow management monitors working capital drivers such as receivables collections, accounts payable timing, wafer purchases and payroll; investing activities track property and equipment acquisitions and available-for-sale debt securities portfolios; financing activities encompass warrant exercises, stock issuances under equity compensation plans, convertible note conversions and debt reduction; and contractual obligations—including term debt, interest payments, software and IP license commitments, operating leases and minimum purchase orders—are recorded and scheduled to support organizational decision-making, resource deployment and operational efficiency.

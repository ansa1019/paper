Comcast underscores its development and planned 2020 launch of the Peacock direct-to-consumer streaming service, the provision of data-driven advertising tools and marketplace solutions to media clients, and the integration of product development, network operations, fulfillment and provisioning activities with its capital and liquidity management. These disclosures illustrate Comcast’s strategic coordination of IT resources, digital technologies and organizational processes to enhance operational efficiency, support evolving business needs and transform the firm’s competitive position.

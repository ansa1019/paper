ADP describes its provision of cloud-based human capital management technology solutions—covering payroll, talent management, human resources management, benefits administration, and workforce management—to employers worldwide and notes that it invests in highly strategic technology areas and next-generation platforms as part of its global HCM strategy to strengthen its underlying business model and prospects for continued growth. Management indicates that it continues to innovate by anticipating evolving client needs and reshaping the HCM industry through strategic cloud-based solutions, further enabled by acquisitions and organic, differentiated investments such as the ADP Marketplace and ADP DataCloud. The company reports that systems development and programming costs reflect increased investments in product innovation, primarily in its next-generation platforms, and emphasizes that operating efficiencies and margin expansion are driven by the successful execution of broad transformation initiatives—particularly improvements in systems infrastructure spend and process automation—while continuing to invest in digital infrastructure, service and distribution capabilities. ADP also recognizes risks related to changes in technology, availability of skilled technical associates, security or cyber breaches and system interruptions and failures, and it highlights the adequacy, effectiveness and success of its business transformation initiatives as key to maintaining performance. Capital expenditures for technology totaled $162.7 million in fiscal 2019, with an expectation of approximately $175 million in fiscal 2020 to support the ongoing delivery of balanced revenue and profit growth and long-term shareholder value.

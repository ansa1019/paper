In our management’s discussion and analysis, we emphasize that to develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities and equipment, and research and development, with R&D expenses varying primarily with the number of development wafers processed, reimbursements under R&D cost-sharing agreements, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs. We share the cost of certain product and process development activities under development agreements with partners, including agreements to jointly develop NAND and 3D XPoint technologies with Intel, reflecting interfirm transactions and strategic resource integration. We continue to evaluate planned technology node transitions, capital spending and re-use rates for NAND equipment and anticipate changing the depreciable life of our NAND equipment from five to seven years beginning in the first quarter of 2020, reducing depreciation expense included in cost of goods sold by approximately $80 million in the first quarter and $100 to $150 million per quarter thereafter. As of August 29, 2019, we had commitments of approximately $4.3 billion for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment—approximately $3.2 billion of which is expected to be paid in 2020—focused on technology transitions and product enablement. To fund these investments and ongoing operations, we are continuously evaluating alternatives for efficiently financing our capital expenditures, including the issuance of securities and drawing on undrawn credit facilities, and expect that our cash and investments, cash flows from operations, and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements through the next 12 months. In January 2019, we exercised our option to acquire Intel’s interest in IMFT, with the closing date set for October 31, 2019, and expect to pay Intel approximately $1.4 billion for its interest and related member debt in the first quarter of 2020, exemplifying strategic resource allocation and interfirm relationship management.

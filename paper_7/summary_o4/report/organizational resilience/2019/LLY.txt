The discussion further details cross-functional coordination of budgeting and resource allocation for research and development, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and divestitures underpinned by rigorous fair-value measurements of intangible assets and contingent liabilities, and the modeling of contractual obligations and post-employment benefit liabilities, collectively evidencing an underlying capability to mobilize data and analytical resources in support of strategic decision-making, performance evaluation, and compliance within evolving regulatory and market contexts.

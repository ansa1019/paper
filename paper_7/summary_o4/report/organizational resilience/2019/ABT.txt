Abbott’s capital expenditures include significant investments in information technology alongside the upgrading and expansion of manufacturing and research facilities and deployment of laboratory instruments with customers, reflecting the firm’s commitment to mobilizing IT‐based resources to support business strategies and work processes. In its diagnostics segment, Abbott has commercialized next-generation “Alinity” systems and solutions designed to increase efficiency by running more tests in less space, generating test results faster, minimizing human errors and providing quality results, supported by informatics solutions to optimize laboratory performance and automation solutions to improve throughput. Abbott’s medical devices portfolio similarly incorporates IT capability through sensor-enabled technologies and enhanced connectivity, such as the TactiCath® contact force ablation catheter with real-time procedural assessment, the smartphone-compatible Confirm Rx® insertable cardiac monitor for remote arrhythmia detection, the FreeStyle Libre® continuous glucose monitoring system offering up to 14-day wearable sensing and optional real-time alarms, and the CardioMEMS® heart failure monitoring system enabling remote patient monitoring. Abbott’s research and development programs across cardiac rhythm management, heart failure, electrophysiology, vascular, structural heart, neuromodulation and diabetes care prioritize the development of next-generation technologies with enhanced patient engagement, expanded connectivity, advanced user-interfaces, magnetic resonance compatibility and remote monitoring capabilities. Across all segments, the firm focuses on integrating technology infrastructure, informatics, automation and user-experience platforms to provide data and information with the requisite accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security and connectivity in response to changing clinical and market needs, underscoring its ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources in support of innovation, operational efficiency and competitive advantage.

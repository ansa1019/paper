Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more by deploying a broad portfolio of cloud-based and other services, software licensing and support, devices and online advertising to drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness and public-sector efficiency. We generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based and other services to people and businesses; licensing and supporting an array of software products; designing, manufacturing and selling devices; and delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience, with financial performance reported across productivity and business processes, intelligent cloud and more personal computing segments. The transition from on-premises licensing to subscription-based and consumption-based cloud offerings has led to software assurance and cloud services being invoiced annually and revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. Significant investments in datacenter costs in support of our cloud-based services, in cloud and AI engineering, in GitHub and LinkedIn integrations, and in our server products and cloud services—driven by 72% Azure growth in fiscal 2019—reflect our evolving IT architecture, infrastructure capability and focus on actionable investments to address changing customer demands, industry trends and competitive forces. Research and development activities—including payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, third-party development and programming costs, localization costs and amortization of purchased software code—seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, as shown by headcount-related expenses in research, development, sales, marketing and administrative functions, and on our ability to execute strategic capital expenditures—including new facilities, datacenters and equipment leases—to support growth in cloud offerings, enhance operational efficiency, ensure information security and connectivity, and ultimately transform Microsoft into a competitive force capable of coordinating its assets, internal processes and interfirm relationships.

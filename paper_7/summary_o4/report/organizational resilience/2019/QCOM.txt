We develop and commercialize foundational digital technologies and products used in mobile devices, IoT applications, automotive telematics and networking systems by leveraging integrated circuits and system software platforms, and we deploy substantial research and development and engineering resources to advance 4G/5G baseband, OFDM-based Wi-Fi, RF front-end, power management, graphics, audio/video codecs, artificial intelligence and virtual/augmented-reality functionalities. Our QCT segment combines hardware and embedded software design, supply-chain coordination and inventory valuation processes to support global OEM production, while our QTL segment applies its competence in intellectual-property management by granting licenses, estimating and recognizing sales-based royalties through device shipment, pricing and product-mix analyses, constraining recognition to mitigate the risk of significant reversals as new licensee information and regulatory developments become available. We monitor investments in both marketable and non-marketable equity instruments, assess potential impairments, test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles annually against operational performance and future cash flows, and value long-lived assets considering cost, market conditions and customer demand forecasts. Our strategic investment arm evaluates and records gains and losses on equity interests with ongoing monitoring for events indicating value changes. We continue to mobilize and reconfigure technology and organizational resources to deploy new business models in adjacent industries such as automotive, computing, IoT and networking, engage with standards bodies, regulators and value-chain partners to maintain governance and compliance, and adapt asset allocation and internal processes in response to intense market competition, 5G network roll-outs, shifting consumer demand, supply-chain dynamics and global regulatory actions, thereby enhancing our agility, dynamic capabilities and alignment of IT and business strategies.

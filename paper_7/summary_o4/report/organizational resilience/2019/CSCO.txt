Cisco designs and sells a broad range of technologies across networking, security, collaboration, applications and the cloud, integrating intent-based technologies to help its customers manage more users, devices and things connecting to their networks and thereby providing a highly secure, intelligent platform for digital business. The company remains focused on accelerating innovation across its portfolio, progressing its strategic priorities—accelerating the pace of innovation, increasing the value of the network and transforming its business model—and has continued its transition to increased software and subscription offerings alongside growth in infrastructure platforms, applications and security, including through the acquisition of Duo Security. As customers add billions of new connections and move to multicloud environments, Cisco believes they seek intent-based networks that deliver meaningful business value through automation, security and analytics across private, hybrid and multicloud environments, under its vision of highly secure, software-defined, automated and intelligent platforms. To support these objectives, Cisco invests aggressively in R&D and, where necessary, licenses or acquires technology to bring products to market in a timely fashion and applies a contractual framework that treats hardware, perpetual and term software licenses, and SaaS arrangements as distinct performance obligations—recognizing revenue upfront for transfer of control and ratably over the contract term for services and updates—as it acquires, deploys, combines and reconfigures physical and intangible IT resources, knowledge, practices and processes to deliver operational flexibility, market responsiveness and competitive advantage in support of evolving business needs.

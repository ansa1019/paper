Management’s discussion notes that the company provides analysis, advice and transactional capabilities to clients in more than 130 countries, reflecting the deployment of technology-enabled systems to support global service delivery. In connection with the integration and restructuring of the JLT acquisition, the company incurred costs primarily related to technology, consulting fees associated with the management of the integration processes and legal fees tied to the rationalization of legal-entity structures. The company’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software—amounting to $421 million in 2019 and $314 million in 2018—primarily relate to computer equipment purchases, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs, underscoring ongoing investments in IT infrastructure and development to enhance business strategies and processes. Moreover, in the risk and insurance services segment, Marsh and Guy Carpenter provide administrative and other services—including the administration and management of quota share panels and fiduciary funds held as collateral under captive insurance arrangements—that depend on secure, reliable information management, connectivity and monitoring systems to meet regulatory requirements and support operational efficiency.

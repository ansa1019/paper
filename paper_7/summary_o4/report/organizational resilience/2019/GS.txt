During 2019, our pre-tax earnings reflected investments in our digital platform, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, our credit card activities and the planned launch of our transaction banking business, which collectively incurred a pre-tax loss of approximately $700 million, and operating expenses included $1.17 billion for communications and technology (up from $1.02 billion in 2018), with higher expenses for consolidated investments and technology—primarily depreciation and amortization, communications and technology, and occupancy—driven in part by our digital lending and deposit platform; in 2018 technology expenses rose to support increased computing services and the development of our digital lending and deposit platform (with related increases in depreciation and amortization, market development and other expenses), while headcount at year-end increased 9% that year and 5% in 2019, reflecting growth in our technology professionals to support these strategic technology investments and ongoing business transformation.

We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end‐user demand; revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of a product to a customer, generally upon delivery, based on an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled, net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other deductions; accruals for rebates and chargebacks are based on estimates that take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns and are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate; our primary objective in managing cash and investments is to maintain safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk, with our investment policy limiting interest‐bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with investment‐grade credit ratings and placing restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer; to achieve a desired mix of fixed‐rate and floating‐rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert fixed‐rate coupons to a floating LIBOR‐based coupon, and to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain foreign‐denominated long‐term notes, we entered into cross‐currency swap contracts that convert interest payments and principal repayments to U.S. dollars; we rely on cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and syndicated credit facilities and access to domestic and foreign debt and equity markets to satisfy our liquidity needs; we believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, dividend payments, stock repurchases and strategic initiatives, including acquisitions and licensing activities; the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and involve subjective and complex judgments; we review the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment and finite‐lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable, and we review indefinite‐lived intangible assets—including in‐process research and development projects acquired in business combinations—annually and upon establishment of technological feasibility or regulatory approval; in order to determine the fair values of intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations and asset acquisitions, we employ discounted cash flow models requiring significant estimates and assumptions regarding costs to complete projects, the probability and timing of regulatory approvals, anticipated net cash flows and appropriate discount rates; and liabilities for uncertain tax positions are recorded only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination and are adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, including amendments to tax law, new regulations, interpretations, audit results and judicial outcomes.

Through our Un-carrier strategy, we have disrupted the wireless communications services industry by actively engaging with and listening to our customers and eliminating their existing pain points, including providing them with unrivaled value, an exceptional experience and implementing signature Un-carrier initiatives that have changed wireless for good; if the merger with Sprint closes, the combined company will build upon our recently launched foundational 5G network and accelerated 600 MHz spectrum to deliver transformational broad, deep and nationwide 5G for all, accelerate innovation and increase competition in the U.S. wireless, video and broadband industries; in December 2019, T-Mobile launched America’s first nationwide 5G network, including prepaid 5G with Metro by T-Mobile, covering more than 200 million people and over 5,000 cities and towns across the United States; in April 2019, we introduced TVISION Home, a rebranded and upgraded version of Layer3 TV delivering what customers want most from high-end home TV, including a premium TV experience and HD and 4K channels; in April 2019, we launched T-Mobile Money, offering customers a no-fee, interest-earning, mobile-first checking account which can be opened and managed from customers’ smartphones; our ability to acquire and retain branded customers is important to our business in the generation of revenues, and we believe our Un-carrier strategy, along with ongoing network improvements, has been successful in attracting and retaining customers as evidenced by continued branded customer growth and improved churn; cost of services primarily includes costs directly attributable to providing wireless service through the operation of our network, including direct switch and cell site costs, network access and transport costs, utilities, maintenance, associated labor costs and data content costs; depreciation and amortization increased primarily from network expansion, including the continued deployment of low-band spectrum, including 600 MHz, and the nationwide launch of our 5G network; interest expense decreased primarily from an increase in capitalized interest costs due to the build-out of our network to utilize our 600 MHz spectrum licenses and the nationwide launch of our 5G network; we maintain vendor financing arrangements with our primary network equipment suppliers, under which we can obtain extended financing terms; and we expect cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest of approximately $400 million, to be $5.9 to $6.2 billion in 2020, which includes expenditures for 600 MHz and 5G deployment.

FPL employs industry-standard valuation techniques and internally developed models to estimate the fair value of contract derivatives by calculating the present value of the difference between contract prices and forward price curves, which are based on observable market quotes, fuel price curves, expected system heat rates and fundamental supply and demand forecasts. NEE applies a value-at-risk model using historical simulation to measure commodity price market risk for trading and mark-to-market portfolios over a one-day holding period at a 95% confidence level, and enforces risk management policies—including counterparty credit limits, credit enhancements and master netting agreements—to monitor and mitigate credit exposures. Actuarial valuations for the defined benefit pension plan incorporate assumptions regarding discount rates, salary increases and expected long-term return on plan assets, use a market-related valuation method to recognize investment gains and losses over a five-year period and evaluate multiple capital market return scenarios, demonstrating sophisticated data analytics and modeling capabilities. In assessing long-lived assets for impairment, NEE compares carrying values to undiscounted future net cash flows and measures fair values by discounting estimated cash flows using current interest rates. For nuclear decommissioning and plant dismantlement obligations, FPL and NEE accrue and fund costs over the expected service life of each unit based on regulator-approved studies that incorporate inflation escalators and projected rates of return, coordinating estimates, regulatory requirements and internal processes. Regulatory accounting recognizes assets and liabilities representing probable future revenues recoverable through the ratemaking process and requires ongoing evaluation of recovery prospects under cost-based rate regulation.

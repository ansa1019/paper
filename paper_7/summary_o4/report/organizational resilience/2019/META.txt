The Company’s disclosures reflect a sustained emphasis on the mobilization and deployment of IT‐based resources to support and enhance its business strategies and operations, including substantial investments in data center capacity, network infrastructure and technical infrastructure to support user growth, increased engagement and the delivery of new products and services; cost of revenue that “consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products,” which “include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as facility and server equipment depreciation, energy and bandwidth costs, and salaries, benefits and share‐based compensation for employees on our operations teams”; research and development expenses “primarily for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products”; reliance on “complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products,” with such models calibrated against user survey data and subject to judgment and margin of error; contractual commitments “related to network infrastructure and our data center operations” under multi‐year agreements securing volume or price; and an explicit expectation that “additional investments in our data center capacity, network infrastructure, and office facilities, as well as scaling our headcount to support our growth, will continue to drive expense growth in 2020,” all of which underscore the firm’s capability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources in support of evolving business needs and competitive positioning.

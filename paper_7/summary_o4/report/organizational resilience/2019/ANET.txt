Arista Networks’ management describes its cloud networking platform, EOS, as purpose-built to be fully programmable, highly modular and reliable, delivering industry-leading performance, scalability, availability, programmability, automation and visibility; the programmability of EOS has enabled the creation of a suite of software applications for workflow automation, network visibility and analytics and has facilitated rapid integration with a wide range of third-party applications for virtualization, management, automation, orchestration and network services.  The company emphasizes its continued investment in research and development—including an allocated portion of facility and IT costs—to enhance the functionality of its cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features, build upon its technology leadership and expand its software core competencies by engineering products to be agnostic to underlying merchant silicon architectures, thereby leveraging merchant silicon vendor investments for cost-effective solutions.  Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, prototype expenses, third-party engineering and contractor support costs and an allocated portion of IT costs, and the company expects these expenses to increase in absolute dollars as it continues to invest in software development to expand platform capabilities.  Sales and marketing expenses likewise include an allocated portion of facility and IT costs and are anticipated to grow as Arista expands its sales force, marketing activities and relationships with channel, technology and system-level partners to reach new end customers more effectively, increase sales to existing customers and provide services and support.  The firm’s development model is focused on the rapid deployment of new features and applications based on its EOS software core competencies, while manufacturing operations and order fulfillment are supported through close collaboration with third-party contract manufacturers and direct fulfillment facilities for final configuration, quality assurance testing and shipment.  Post-contract support revenue is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the support contracts, reflecting the ongoing delivery of technical support, hardware repair and replacement parts, bug fixes, patches and unspecified upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis.  Operating expenses are expected to continue increasing in absolute dollars to support growth, research and development, and IT infrastructure enhancements.

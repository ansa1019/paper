Management’s discussion highlights our reliance on digital technologies and information systems capability, connecting consumers and travel service providers through our online platforms and mobile apps and continuously improving the user experience. We maximize economies of scale by sharing resources and technological innovations across brands, co-developing new services and coordinating market activities to support business strategies. Booking.com’s merchant transaction model demonstrates our competence in deploying payment-processing infrastructure to facilitate secure and flexible payment terms, while associated technology expenses—comprising software licenses, system maintenance, outsourced data-center and cloud computing costs, contractor services and data communications—increased by 22.3 % in 2019 to support higher capacity and expansion. Depreciation and amortization associated with data-center equipment and internally developed software also rose substantially due to higher capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs, reflecting ongoing investment in IT resources and capabilities. We have experienced a significant shift to mobile platforms, requiring our IT architecture and development processes to adapt to changes in consumer behavior and traffic patterns, further underscoring our focus on leveraging IT capability to enhance operational flexibility, support work processes and maintain competitive advantage in a dynamic market environment.

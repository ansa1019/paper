The MD&A discloses a number of initiatives that illustrate the firm’s evolving IT capability in coordinating assets, internal processes and interfirm relationships by mobilizing technology‐based resources to support business strategies and work processes.  In its operations priorities, the company commits to “modernizing our workplace to improve end‐user productivity and experience, enabling our employees to innovate and better serve our customers; standardizing and simplifying our technology to best support and enable our divisions; reducing our cyber security risk while augmenting process maturity and producing outcomes commensurate with our risk appetite; and maintaining our strong commitment to quality, utilizing shared data processes and capabilities.”  Within its customer agenda, management intends to “modernize and enhance the delivery of our products across multiple channels (e.g., S&P Global platform, MI Smart MOVE, feeds, application programming interfaces)” and to deliver ESG, small and medium-sized enterprise data and marketplace solutions “on schedule and with strong commercial traction.”  In its 2020 outlook, S&P Global Ratings will “leverage new technology and data capabilities to transform its value chain, strengthen analytical excellence, expand into new high-potential geographies and extend its strong analytical capabilities to new opportunities such as ESG and cybersecurity,” although results were partially offset by increased cloud infrastructure spend.  Market Intelligence in 2019 “launched unique technology innovations including textual data analytics, Kensho’s Scribe and several ESG-related offerings,” “continued to develop its desktop platform by enhancing its product offerings and developing its analytical capabilities,” and in 2020 “will continue to focus on leveraging its strong content heritage to expand the core business, streamlining and enriching the customer experience across all delivery platforms, and harnessing new data sources and technology to extend into new geographies and growth areas such as ESG.”  Platts likewise reports sustained demand for its data and benchmark services and notes that it “continued to drive commercial transformation by enhancing and simplifying the customer experience” through platform innovation and Asia-focused capability expansion.  These disclosures underscore the firm’s broad application of technology, knowledge, practices and organizational resources to pursue competitive advantage, process optimization and value creation across its global businesses.

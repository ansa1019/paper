In 2019, the Company continued its focus on mobilizing and deploying resources in support of strategic initiatives through projects to develop new products, investments in new technologies and recent acquisitions, contributing to research, development and engineering spending levels; the leveraging of higher sales volumes and sustained operating expense improvement initiatives reflect an emphasis on process optimization, resource allocation and integration of acquired businesses, including inventory step-up to fair value and other acquisition and integration-related charges; capital allocation decisions coordinated assets and internal processes, as excess operating cash was used first to fund acquisitions and integration costs, while a global cash management strategy encompassing liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations supplemented operating cash flow with debt financing as necessary and informed the suspension of share repurchases; these activities collectively supported organizational transformation, value creation and the coordination of interconnected assets, processes and resources to further long-term business strategies.

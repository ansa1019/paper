The MD&A does not explicitly discuss “IT capability,” but many of the described financial and operational processes implicitly rely on robust information management capability and integrated technology resources to coordinate assets, internal processes and interfirm relationships in support of strategic decision-making and business transformation. For example, the establishment of rebate and chargeback accruals “based on the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices” and the use of “internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time” require timely, accurate data capture, analytics and system-based forecasting; credit risk monitoring through “regular communication with customers regarding the status of receivable balances” and the use of factoring arrangements implies IT-supported customer relationship and receivables management systems; deferred tax and pension obligations employ a “yield-curve approach” and actuarial models that depend on system-enabled scenario analysis, probability inputs and complex calculations; goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing and “quantitative impairment tests” require the aggregation of future net cash flow projections, discount rate assumptions and market-based inputs via information-systems capability; and the measurement and revaluation of contingent consideration liabilities through “probability-weighted expected payment models” and “monte carlo simulation models” discounted to present value reflect the mobilization and deployment of IT-based resources alongside financial, regulatory and commercial data. Moreover, strategic objectives such as “productivity initiatives in supply chain and ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses” and the planned integration of the Allergan acquisition underscore the importance of leveraging digital technologies, process automation and organizational competencies to enhance agility, operational flexibility and competitive advantage.

Boeing’s operations leverage an extensive network of non-U.S. partners, key suppliers and subcontractors to coordinate interfirm relationships and support global production and delivery processes, while its strategy is supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital, which facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for Boeing customers. The company continually monitors the global trade environment for changes in tariffs, trade agreements, sanctions or other potential geopolitical and economic developments that may impact the business and informs its resource allocation, production planning and risk management accordingly. Boeing focuses on producing the products and providing the services that the market demands and continues to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality to provide a fair return for shareholders, integrating its commercial, defense, space and security resources to deliver capability-driven solutions at reduced costs. Airlines are using data analytics to plan flight operations and predictive maintenance to improve productivity and efficiency and are outsourcing spares management to reduce the size and cost of their spare parts inventory. Boeing’s fleet support services include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, information services and systems, and the provision of technical data and documents to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation. As the size of the worldwide commercial airline fleet grows, demand is increasing for aftermarket services designed to increase efficiency and extend the economic lives of airplanes, and Boeing’s 20-year forecast of 4.6% annual passenger traffic growth and a $6.8 trillion market for approximately 44,000 new airplanes guides its long-term planning and investment decisions. In response to competitive pressures and regulatory actions such as the 737 MAX grounding, Boeing is focused on safely returning the 737 MAX to service, improving cost performance and working with suppliers to ensure its supply chain can support production plans once deliveries resume.

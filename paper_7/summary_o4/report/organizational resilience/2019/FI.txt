We describe our operations as a leading global provider of financial services technology—offering account processing systems; electronic payments processing products and services; internet and mobile banking platforms; merchant transaction processing and POS hardware, including the Clover® line; prepaid, payroll and check-verification solutions—which illustrates our coordination and deployment of IT resources and infrastructure to support and enhance client work processes and interfirm transactions. In our discussion of industry trends, we note that rapidly advancing digital technologies and expansion of real-time payments infrastructure drive payments companies to modernize technology, leverage data and enhance the customer experience, emphasizing information management capabilities—accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and tailored access—to meet rising business and consumer expectations. We anticipate that financial institutions will increasingly outsource technology platforms and transaction processing to achieve economies of scale in the development and maintenance of infrastructure, networks, software applications and security-and-fraud management products, reflecting a shift from in-house technology to managed services that integrate IT functionality with business process outsourcing and data center operations under transition services agreements. Our revenue recognition policies for processing and services and for software and hardware elements—including hosted licensed software, customized software development, software licenses and POS device sales—underscore the firm’s competence in deploying, combining and reconfiguring IT systems capabilities in support of multi-element contracts and stand-ready service obligations. Integration activities arising from acquisitions, such as data center consolidation, vendor-spend rationalization, amortization of acquired intangible assets (including software) and related professional services costs, further demonstrate our dynamic IT capability to optimize processes, reconfigure resources and enhance operational flexibility. Finally, our enterprise priorities—active portfolio management, enhancement of digital payment solutions, integration value delivery and disciplined capital allocation—reflect the mobilization of IT-based resources alongside management skills, organizational resources and relational practices to drive innovation, process optimization, competitive positioning and long-term firm performance.

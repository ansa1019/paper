In 2018, Amgen continued to execute its transformation and process improvement efforts, first announced in 2014, to establish a more agile and efficient operating model across the enterprise, enabling the reallocation of resources to support product launches, clinical programs and external business development while funding its innovative pipeline and growth opportunities. All expense categories benefited from these transformation and process improvement initiatives, which have realized approximately $1.9 billion of savings since inception and have been reinvested into newer and recently launched products. The company monitors inventory levels at wholesalers by leveraging data from its wholesalers and other third-party sources to maintain appropriate levels relative to end-user demand and to refine its estimates for sales deductions and returns. Amgen’s strategic framework comprises a set of integrated activities intended to maintain and strengthen its competitive position through advancement of its innovative pipeline and branded biosimilar programs, expansion of its global geographic reach and deployment of next-generation biomanufacturing capabilities. The new Rhode Island facility, the first of its kind in the United States, will use proven next-generation biomanufacturing capabilities to deliver a reliable, high-quality, compliant supply of medicines with a smaller footprint and reduced water, energy and carbon intensity. Financial management is conducted under a disciplined investment policy that limits marketable security investments to specified debt and money market instruments, and through active capital allocation decisions—including cash dividends, stock repurchases, debt repayment and strategic transactions—to optimize funding for working capital, R&D, manufacturing and external business development. To manage interest rate and foreign exchange exposures, the company has entered into interest rate and cross-currency swaps and maintains a commercial paper program, a $2.5 billion syndicated revolving credit facility and an SEC shelf registration statement for debt and equity issuances, all governed by covenants designed to preserve operational flexibility and support capital structure objectives. Forward-looking statements published in this report are based on management’s beliefs and assumptions derived from information available at the time of issuance and are communicated through meetings, webcasts, telephone and conference calls with investors and analysts.

Applied provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the semiconductor, display and related industries and works closely with its global customers to design systems and processes that meet their planned technical and production requirements. The Applied Global Services segment delivers integrated solutions to optimize equipment and fab performance and productivity, including spares, upgrades, services, certain remanufactured earlier-generation equipment and factory automation software for semiconductor, display and solar products. Most of Appliedâ€™s existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies, materials and processes, and in certain instances Applied acquires technologies, either in existing or new product areas, to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market. Management believes it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in research, development and engineering to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets current and projected customer requirements and has maintained and intends to continue its commitment to investing in R&D&E in order to continue to offer new products and technologies. In fiscal 2018, Applied increased its R&D&E investments across semiconductor systems and display and adjacent markets, including etch, e-beam inspection and other materials engineering solutions to improve chip performance and enable advanced displays, with etch investments focused on supporting the adoption of precision etch technology for enabling continued scaling of 3D logic and memory chips. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 were primarily for real property acquisitions and improvements in North America and Taiwan, as well as investments in demonstration, testing and laboratory tools. At the corporate level, certain operating expenses include costs for share-based compensation; management, finance, legal, human resource and R&D&E functions provided at the corporate level; and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy.

Our strategic planning recognizes “digitizing the enterprise” as one of five core priorities, reflecting our commitment to integrate digital technologies, e-commerce capabilities and enterprise‐wide transactional systems through global centers of excellence that simplify and standardize processes and support the business units. We have established a corporate enabling services organization focused on both policy and governance and on simplifying and standardizing key transactional processes to better coordinate our assets, people and intercompany relationships. Furthermore, in response to the rapidly evolving digital landscape and growth of e-commerce, we are continuously strengthening our marketing and innovation capabilities to compete in a digital environment, maintain brand relevance and align our technology resources with consumer-centric strategies. These initiatives underscore our focus on enhancing operational efficiency, connectivity, data‐driven decision-making and agility across our value chain to support long-term competitive advantage.

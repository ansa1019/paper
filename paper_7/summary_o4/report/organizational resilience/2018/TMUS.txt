Our un-carrier strategy and ongoing network improvements reflect a systematic deployment of technology resources and internal process coordination to support our business strategy and enhance firm capability. During 2018 we continued the build-out of our 4G LTE network, deployed low-band spectrum, including 600 MHz, and laid the groundwork to rapidly launch a nationwide 5G network to accelerate innovation and strengthen our competitive positioning. We implemented the first component of a new billing system, leveraged managed services and capital lease facilities for network equipment and services, and expanded our digital infrastructure through MVNO and M2M partnerships, all of which underscore our ability to acquire, deploy and reconfigure IT-based resources in support of operational flexibility and market responsiveness. Our acquisitions of Iowa Wireless and Layer3 TV illustrate strategic investments in complementary digital technologies to distribute direct-to-home Internet-based video programming and to advance our video strategy. The un-carrier next initiative also restructured our customer service model into regional “teams of experts” accessible without bots, integrated with the T-Mobile Tuesdays app for exclusive digital content subscriptions, demonstrating our information management capability to deliver data and content with appropriate accuracy, timeliness, security and connectivity in response to evolving customer needs. Growth in branded postpaid “other” customers—comprising tablets, wearables and SyncUP® DRIVE—and continued branded customer additions further highlight our competency in coordinating interfirm transactions and leveraging IT functionality to drive revenue, improve customer experience and sustain a competitive advantage in a dynamic market environment.

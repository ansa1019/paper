During 2018, Stryker’s research, development and engineering expenses represented 6.3% of net sales and reflected projects to develop new products, investments in new technologies and recent acquisitions that contributed to spending levels, indicating an ongoing commitment to technology resource allocation and capability enhancement; the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 (ASC 606) and related amendments, including the reclassification of costs previously presented as selling, general and administrative expenses to net sales, required substantial modifications to information processing and reporting processes to ensure timeliness, accuracy and compliance; management’s capital allocation strategy, which prioritizes acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases, demonstrates the firm’s ability to mobilize and deploy financial and technological resources, as evidenced by the acquisitions of K2M Group Holdings and Entellus Medical to expand its product and technology portfolios; the use of non-GAAP financial measures—such as percentage sales growth in constant currency, adjusted gross profit and adjusted net earnings per diluted share—underscores advanced information management practices and decision-support capabilities designed to provide reliable, comparable performance metrics; operating expense improvement initiatives and leverage from higher sales volumes highlight a focus on process optimization, operational flexibility and efficiency across internal processes and interfirm transactions; a global cash management strategy, which considers liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations, further illustrates integrated resource management and organizational coordination; and costs incurred to update the company’s quality system, product labeling and remanufacturing processes to comply with medical device regulations point to continuous enhancements in information governance, process control and compliance-oriented technology functionalities.

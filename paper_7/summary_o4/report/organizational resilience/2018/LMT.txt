We are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services, and we also provide a broad range of system integration and cybersecurity services. Our main areas of focus include defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity. We continue to innovate and invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers and invest in our people so that we have the technical skills necessary to succeed. In shaping our portfolio, we selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments at attractive valuations to expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies, and in August 2016 we divested our former Information Systems & Global Solutions business. A key component of our strategic plan is to grow international sales through strengthening relationships via partnerships and joint technology efforts. Our Rotary and Mission Systems segment supports the needs of government customers in cybersecurity and delivers communication and command and control capabilities through complex mission solutions, and our Space segment provides network-enabled situational awareness and integrates complex space and ground-based global systems to help our customers gather, analyze, and securely distribute critical intelligence data.

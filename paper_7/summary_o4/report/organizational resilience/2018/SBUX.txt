Operating margin compression in fiscal 2018 was driven in part by higher restructuring and impairment costs and by higher salaries and benefits related to digital platforms, technology infrastructure and innovations, which also contributed to a 60-basis-point increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues. Starbucks noted its ability to successfully make disciplined investments in its business and partners through targeted investments in digital relationships, technology infrastructure and customer-relevant beverage innovation. Looking ahead to fiscal 2019, the company intends to enhance the in-store experience and deliver customer-relevant beverage innovation and digital relationships as core elements of its strategic priorities. Capital expenditures of approximately $2.0 billion for fiscal 2019 are expected to support the retail portfolio—including new and existing stores and strategic store-related initiatives—and to enable further technology deployments and digital platform enhancements.

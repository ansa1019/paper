Our discussion highlights the firm’s investment in its innovative security operating platform and its evolving IT capabilities, including a traffic classification engine that identifies network traffic by application, user, and content across networks, endpoints, and the cloud, thereby safely enabling applications and data and preventing cyberattacks. The platform’s architecture offers superior performance and lowers total cost of ownership by simplifying security operations and infrastructure and eliminating multiple stand-alone hardware and software products. These capabilities enable end-customers to pursue transformative digital initiatives such as public cloud and mobility while maintaining visibility and control of data and critical control systems. We continue to invest in the innovation and timely development of new features and products to extend our platform’s capabilities, including GlobalProtect Cloud Service, logging service, machine-learning–based magnifier, PAN-OS enhancements, and Traps 5.0, as well as extending protections and integration to GCP, AWS, and Azure multi-cloud environments. Strategic acquisitions of Evident.io and Secdo have expanded our API-based security, cloud services infrastructure protection, and endpoint detection and response capabilities, including unique data collection and visualization. To support future growth, we must improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes efficiently.

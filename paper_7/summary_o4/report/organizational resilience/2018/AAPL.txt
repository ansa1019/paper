Apple’s capital expenditures of approximately $14.0 billion in 2019 include investments in data centers and information systems hardware, software and enhancements, reflecting the deployment of IT infrastructure to support its digital content and services platforms such as iCloud, the iTunes Store, App Store and Apple Pay. The company’s revenue recognition policy for hardware bundled with essential software and non-software services allocates and defers revenue for unspecified software upgrade rights and services over the estimated delivery period, underscoring its systems capability to provide timely software updates and support services in alignment with product life cycles. Research and development spending increased by 23% in 2018, driven in part by infrastructure-related costs to expand R&D activities, while selling, general and administrative expenses grew due to infrastructure-related and professional services costs, evidencing continued investment in technology resources and organizational processes. Other purchase obligations include noncancelable commitments for internet and telecommunications services, further indicating the company’s focus on maintaining connectivity and digital infrastructure. Through these actions, Apple demonstrates its ability to acquire, deploy and reconfigure IT resources to support and enhance its business strategies and work processes, mobilizing technology and organizational resources to drive innovation, operational flexibility and competitive advantage.

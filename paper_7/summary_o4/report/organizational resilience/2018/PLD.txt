Management evaluates our business operations based on the net operating income of our two operating segments, real estate operations and strategic capital, using non-GAAP financial measures that reconcile segment revenues and expenses directly from our financial statements to operating income and adjusted earnings. We allocate the costs of our property management and leasing functions to each segment based on square footage, calculate rent rate growth and changes in NOI from development completions period over period, and modified definitions of our operating metrics to align methodologies with members of the industrial REIT group. Our same store analysis removes the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using reported period-end exchange rates and excludes non-strategic properties, development properties not stabilized at the beginning of the period and one-time items to derive net effective and cash basis NOI. We review operating fundamentals on an operations-and-maintenance basis, including consolidated and unconsolidated co-investment ventures, reconcile segment NOI to consolidated operating income, and translate foreign currency movements to reflect our share of net earnings from unconsolidated entities. We consider our ability to generate cash from unrestricted balances, net cash flow from property operations, strategic capital revenues, management fees, venture distributions, property contributions and dispositions, available credit facilities and proceeds from debt and equity issuances to be adequate for anticipated development, acquisition, debt service and dividend requirements, while maintaining compliance with credit facility covenants, monitoring credit ratings, and managing debt maturities. Our critical accounting policies for acquisitions include purchase price allocations based on discounted cash flow analyses or capitalizations of estimated NOI using market rents, growth rates, discount and capitalization rates, and for recoverability we compare carrying values to estimated undiscounted cash flows and determine fair value through income approaches and third-party appraisals. To measure ongoing performance, we reconcile net earnings to NAREIT defined FFO by excluding historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from sales of previously depreciated properties and adjust to derive FFO, as modified by Prologis, by excluding unrealized foreign currency and derivative gains or losses, deferred income tax expense or benefit, and current income tax expense related to acquired tax liabilities, and further adjust to core FFO by excluding gains on dispositions of development properties and land, current income tax expense on dispositions, acquisition expenses, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt and repurchase of preferred stock, and other nonrecurring items, to inform budgeting, forecasting, strategic resource allocation, and investor guidance.

The company’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software, which amounted to $314 million in 2018 and $302 million in 2017, primarily relate to computer equipment purchases, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities and software development costs. During 2018, Marsh initiated a program to simplify the organization through reduced management layers and more common structures across regions and businesses, targeting increased efficiencies and additional capacity for reinvestment in people and technology. In its risk and insurance services segment, Marsh provides consulting and analytics services to insurers and undertakes catastrophe and financial modeling functions, reflecting an emphasis on data‐driven support and process capabilities. Mercer applies a proprietary model to determine expected returns on plan assets, incorporating actual and target portfolio allocations, historical performance, forward‐looking economic analysis and correlations among asset classes. Under the new revenue recognition standard, the company capitalizes incremental costs to obtain contracts—primarily commissions and sales bonus payments—and amortizes these deferred costs over the expected life of the associated customer relationships, thereby aligning contract costs with revenue recognition. These activities underscore ongoing investments in technology infrastructure, process redesign and information systems to support business strategies, drive operational efficiency and reinforce the firm’s ability to coordinate its assets, internal processes and interfirm relationships.

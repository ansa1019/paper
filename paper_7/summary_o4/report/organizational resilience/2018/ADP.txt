During fiscal 2018, ADP executed on a voluntary early retirement program and established a transformation office to drive broad-based transformation initiatives, completed migrations of its mid-market clients to the latest version of Workforce Now, and continued to migrate clients to its strategic platforms while making targeted investments in research and development to deliver best-in-class cloud-based human capital management technology solutions. The company affirms its commitment to anticipating how the world of work is transforming by reshaping the HCM industry through organic innovation of next-generation platforms and strategic acquisitions, and by prioritizing investments in technology, service, and distribution to strengthen its underlying business model and competitive positioning. Systems development and programming costs remained flat as increased expenditures on product innovation and support for its solutions were largely offset by higher capitalization of strategic project costs, reflecting a disciplined approach to developing, deploying, and maintaining its technology portfolio. These initiatives support ADPâ€™s ongoing strategy to streamline operations, extend world-class distribution capabilities, leverage its talent and culture, and transform the business for sustained success in a dynamic global HCM environment.

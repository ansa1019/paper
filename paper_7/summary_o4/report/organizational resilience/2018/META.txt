Community operations, safety and security investments further reflect IT governance and operational flexibility to meet regulatory and business needs. These disclosures illustrate the firm’s capacity to acquire, deploy and reconfigure IT resources in support of its business strategy, enhance information management, connectivity, system reliability and performance, and sustain competitive advantage.

In its global operations, the company relies on an extensive network of non-U.S. partners, key suppliers and subcontractors and integrates its defense, intelligence, communications, security, space and services resources to deliver capability-driven solutions at reduced cost. The company focuses on producing market-demanded products and services while finding new ways to improve efficiency and quality, managing complex performance and reliability standards through extensive coordination and integration with suppliers, regulators and highly skilled labor. Across commercial activities, fleet support services encompass flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operations throughout their lifecycle. In response to growing fleet size and evolving operational needs, airlines are using data analytics to plan flight operations and predictive maintenance to improve their productivity and efficiency and are outsourcing spares management to third parties to optimize inventory costs. The aviation services market remains intensely competitive, compelling continuous process optimization, product and service innovation and supply-chain coordination to achieve acceptable profit margins. The development and ongoing production of new aircraft derivatives involves extensive systems integration, technical change incorporation, learning-curve improvements and rigorous testing and certification processes, all requiring accurate and timely information across interfirm transactions and internal processes. Under long-term contract and program accounting, the company employs detailed estimates of costs, sales price escalation, supplier performance trends and change orders to manage performance obligations, underscoring the importance of information accuracy, timeliness and integration. The company also continues to monitor and mitigate risks—from export-import constraints to geopolitical and trade developments—through ongoing monitoring of exposures and alternative financing arrangements.

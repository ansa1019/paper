Servicenow, the company that makes work, work better for people, is a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing services that define, structure, manage and automate digital workflows for global enterprises and delivers digital workflows that help our customers create great experiences and unlock productivity. We typically deliver our software via the internet as a service, through an easy-to-use, consumer product-like interface, which means it can be easily configured and rapidly deployed, and in a minority of cases customers deploy our software internally or contract with a third party to host the software to support their unique regulatory or security requirements. We continue to invest in the development of our services, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long‚Äêterm growth. Cost of subscription revenues consists primarily of data center capacity costs, which include colocation costs associated with our data centers as well as interconnectivity between data centers, depreciation related to our infrastructure hardware equipment dedicated for customer use, amortization of intangible assets, expenses associated with software, IT services and support dedicated for customer use, personnel-related costs directly associated with data center operations and customer support, and allocated overhead. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our research and development staff, allocated overhead, data center capacity costs, costs associated with outside services contracted for research and development purposes, amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of infrastructure hardware equipment used solely for research and development purposes. Operating leases consist of future non-cancelable minimum rental payments under leases for some of our offices and data centers. We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents balance and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including expansion of data centers, lease obligations, expenditures related to the growth of our headcount and the acquisition of fixed assets, intangibles, and investments in office facilities, to accommodate our growth for at least the next 12 months.

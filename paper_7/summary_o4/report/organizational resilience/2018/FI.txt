We provide account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, internet and mobile banking systems and related services designed to support our clients’ digital channels and transaction processing needs. The focus on digital channels by both financial institutions and their customers, as well as the growing volume and types of payment transactions in the marketplace, continues to elevate the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions, and we expect that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information, maintain regulatory compliance and offer innovative new services in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment. We anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes in an evolving marketplace. We believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments, and we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions, including electronic transactions through digital channels, will continue to increase, which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us. During our acquisitions, such as those deepening our presence in debit card processing and broadening our digital banking solutions, we integrate software, data center and technical services under transition services agreements to enhance our technology infrastructure and service capabilities. Cost of processing and services includes infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain software applications, equipment and data communication, client support, and depreciation and amortization, reflecting our ongoing investments in technology platforms and operational support. Revenue arrangements for processing and services typically consist of stand-ready obligations to provide specific services over multi-year contracts, with performance obligations evaluated and revenue recognized as control is transferred, underscoring our competence in delivering hosted software and service offerings. We expect that continued innovation in our electronic payments, internet and mobile banking systems, fraud and risk management products, and consulting services will further transform our offerings and support our clients’ evolving business strategies, regulatory requirements and operational efficiencies.

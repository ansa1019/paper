We have made significant investments in our IT capability by allocating both fixed and variable resources to build and run our technology infrastructure—inclusive of servers, networking equipment, data centers, and related depreciation, rent, utilities, and other expenses—and to build, enhance, and add features to our online stores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings, as well as to optimize our fulfillment centers and other facilities. Our technology and content costs encompass payroll and related expenses for computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees engaged in research and development, design, maintenance, and curation of products and services, reflecting the application of both physical and intangible IT resources and management skills to support business strategies and work processes. We seek to invest efficiently in AWS, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other services, and in technology infrastructure aimed at enhancing the customer experience, improving process efficiencies and operational flexibility, and leveraging scale, cross‐functional systems and geographic expansion to sustain competitive advantage in online commerce, cloud services and interfirm transactions.

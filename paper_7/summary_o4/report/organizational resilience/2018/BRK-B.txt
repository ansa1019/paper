Berkshire Hathaway reports that it “manages its operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis,” noting that “there are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses,” while the “senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the chief executive to head each of the operating businesses,” reflecting the need for robust coordination and reporting processes across its diverse subsidiaries. The MD&A also discloses that “beginning in 2018, our periodic net earnings include changes in unrealized gains and losses on our investments in equity securities,” demonstrating an integration of market valuation data into its financial reporting. In its critical accounting policies, Berkshire Hathaway explains that “we record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses… based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable” and that “we use a variety of techniques in establishing claim liabilities and all techniques require significant judgments and assumptions,” evidencing substantial information management capabilities in its insurance operations, including detailed actuarial analyses of case development patterns, paid and incurred loss triangles and reserve adequacy testing. The discussion of business segment data and note 26 underscores the company’s reliance on consolidated reporting systems to coordinate strategic decision-making, resource deployment and performance evaluation across its insurance, railroad, utilities, energy and manufacturing businesses.

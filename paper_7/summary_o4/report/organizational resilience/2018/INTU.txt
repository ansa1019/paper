Management notes that the rapid expansion of cloud-based services is creating a more dynamic and highly competitive software industry, with high availability and speed of service reshaping customer expectations globally and accelerating product introductions and enhancements. The company’s growth strategy depends on its ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, enter new markets, and drive broad adoption of the products and services it develops and markets, while also leveraging the strength of its third-party business relationships. As the firm offers more online services, the ongoing operation and availability of its platforms and systems and those of its external service providers has become increasingly important. Because the company helps customers manage their financial lives, it faces risks associated with the hosting, collection, use, and retention of personal customer information and data, and accordingly is investing significant management attention and resources in its information technology infrastructure and in its privacy and security capabilities, with plans to continue doing so. In fiscal 2018, the acquisition of TSheets, Exactor, and Applatix augmented the QuickBooks offerings with automated time tracking and scheduling and the calculation and filing of sales and use taxes, reflecting the firm’s ability to integrate and deploy IT-based resources to enhance its online ecosystem. This ecosystem delivered 40 percent revenue growth in the small business & self-employed segment, driven by a 43 percent increase in QuickBooks Online subscribers to 3.4 million and a 24 percent increase in online payroll and payments revenue, underscoring the firm’s competence in scaling service platforms. Moreover, personalization and data-driven insights, augmented by artificial intelligence and machine learning, are transforming the way that people manage their financial lives, highlighting the company’s focus on advanced technology functionalities to support evolving business needs.

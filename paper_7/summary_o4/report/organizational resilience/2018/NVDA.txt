In fiscal year 2019, operating expenses increased substantially due in part to “infrastructure costs” associated with employee additions and higher compensation, reflecting investments in the technology infrastructure necessary to support our accelerated development and deployment activities; our Tegra brand “integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, and incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as well as for game consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices,” demonstrating the deployment and integration of IT resources to meet evolving business needs; for our datacenter platform we unveiled advances in our deep learning computing infrastructure—including “Nvidia Tesla V100 GPUs with 32GB memory,” “Nvidia NVSwitch GPU interconnect fabric,” “the Nvidia DGX-2 and HGX-2 for AI and HPC,” “the Nvidia RTX server” and “TensorRT 4 AI inference accelerator software”—and introduced “Rapids, an open-source GPU-acceleration platform for data science and machine learning,” launched the Nvidia T4 cloud GPU and “Nvidia TensorRT hyperscale inference platform for advanced acceleration in hyperscale datacenters,” and announced “GPU acceleration for Kubernetes to facilitate enterprise inference deployment on multi-cloud GPU clusters,” all underscoring our capability to acquire, integrate, reconfigure and allocate digital technologies and IT resources for high-performance computing services; we also released software development tools such as the “Nvidia CUDA-accelerated Redcode RAW decode SDK” for 8K video editing, illustrating our ability to provide specialized software capabilities; in our license and development arrangements we require significant customization of our intellectual property components and therefore “recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed,” measuring progress based on actual cost incurred, and in our software licensing model we “allocate revenue to the software license and post-contract customer support on a relative standalone selling price basis” with license revenue recognized upfront and support revenue recognized ratably over the service period, reflecting our information management capability to tailor and deliver accurate, timely and reliable digital services; and in the automotive market we introduced “the Nvidia Drive Constellation server with Drive Sim software to safely test drive autonomous vehicles over billions of miles in virtual reality by leveraging Nvidia GPUs and Nvidia Drive Pegasus,” exemplifying strategic deployment of digital simulation infrastructure to support complex operational needs.

UnitedHealth Group reports that through its diversified family of businesses, it leverages core competencies in data analytics and health information; advanced technology; and clinical expertise, deploying these capabilities across its two strategically aligned platforms, UnitedHealthcare and Optum, and that it works together with clinicians to leverage data and analytics to provide the necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes. The company notes that evolving delivery system and payment modernization trends create needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician, support new primary care channels and require investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which it believes provide growth opportunities for its Optum business platform. In its OptumHealth segment, revenue and earnings from operations increased primarily due to organic and acquisition‐related growth in care delivery and behavioral health, digital consumer engagement and health financial services, while OptumInsight’s growth was driven by expanded data analytics product and service offerings, managed services and advisory services, and OptumRx likewise realized revenue and earnings growth across specialty pharmacy, home delivery services and overall prescription volumes. The company further discloses significant investments in property, equipment and capitalized software in support of these capabilities and the application of data management processes such as estimating CMS risk adjustment revenues based on submitted and anticipated data.

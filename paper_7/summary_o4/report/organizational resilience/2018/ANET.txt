Our cloud networking solutions consist of our extensible operating system, or EOS, a set of network applications and our Ethernet switching and routing platforms that deliver industry-leading performance, scalability, availability, programmability, automation and visibility; the programmability of EOS has allowed us to create a set of software applications that address the requirements of cloud networking, including workflow automation, network visibility and analytics, and has also allowed us to rapidly integrate with a wide range of third-party applications for virtualization, management, automation, orchestration and network services; we believe one of our greatest strengths lies in our rapid development of new features and applications; in order to support our strong growth, we have and may continue to accelerate our investment in infrastructure, such as enterprise resource planning software and other technologies to improve the efficiency of our operations; we intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization to enhance the functionality of our existing cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features, and build upon our technology leadership; our development model is focused on the development of new products based on our EOS software and enhancements to EOS; we engineer our products to be agnostic to the underlying merchant silicon architecture and combine our EOS software with merchant silicon into a family of switching and routing products, which enables us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve cost-effective solutions; research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, prototype expenses, third-party engineering and contractor support costs, and an allocated portion of facility and IT costs including depreciation; sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, marketing and promotional activities, and an allocated portion of facility and IT costs including depreciation; general and administrative expenses consist primarily of litigation-related expenses, personnel costs, professional services fees, and an allocated portion of facility and IT costs including depreciation; cost of revenue primarily consists of amounts paid for inventory to our third-party contract manufacturers and merchant silicon vendors, overhead costs in our manufacturing operations department, and other manufacturing-related costs associated with manufacturing our products and managing our inventory; we procure certain merchant silicon components from multiple vendors and work closely with third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture our products and deliver them through direct fulfillment facilities, performing labeling, final configuration, quality assurance testing and shipment to customers; and we intend to continue expanding our sales force and marketing activities in key geographies, as well as our relationships with channel, technology and system-level partners in order to reach new end customers more effectively, increase sales to existing customers, and provide services and support effectively.

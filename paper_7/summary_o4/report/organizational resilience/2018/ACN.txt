Consulting revenue growth was driven by very strong demand for digital-, cloud- and security-related services and assisting clients with the adoption of new technologies, while clients remained focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency and on projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses. In our outsourcing business, we experienced growing demand to assist clients with the operation and maintenance of digital-related services and cloud enablement, with clients likewise focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and cost efficiency. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs.

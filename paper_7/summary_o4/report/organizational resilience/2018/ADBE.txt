During fiscal 2018, we completed the acquisitions of Marketo and Magento and continued to integrate these digital experience and commerce platform technologies into our Adobe Experience Cloud, reflecting an expansion of our IT capabilities to support end-to-end digital workflows and interfirm transactions. Our Digital Media segment leverages cloud-based creative and document services—Creative Cloud and Document Cloud—which deliver desktop tools, mobile apps and cloud-based services including storage and syncing of files across users’ machines, access to marketplace, social and community-based features with our Adobe Stock and Behance services, and integrated document creation, review, signature and tracking (Acrobat DC and Adobe Sign) to enhance information management capability with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access. We enter into contracts with third parties for hosting services and use of data center facilities, and our data center costs—comprising depreciation expense and operating lease payments associated with computer equipment, rack space, power and similar items—along with salaries and related expenses of network operations, implementation, account management and technical support personnel, ensure operational flexibility and scalability of our network infrastructure. Our Adobe Advertising Cloud delivers an end-to-end platform for managing advertising across traditional TV and digital formats and simplifies the delivery of video, display and search advertising across channels; our Analytics Cloud uniquely integrates audiences as the core system of intelligence by capturing, aggregating and rationalizing vast amounts of disparate data into singular customer profiles; our Marketing Cloud provides an integrated set of solutions for personalization, targeting and campaign orchestration; and our Magento Commerce Cloud offers digital commerce, order management and predictive intelligence based on a unified commerce platform. Research and development expenses—primarily salary and benefit expenses for software developers and contracted development efforts—support continuous enhancements to our technology portfolio, while sales and marketing investments, including our direct sales force and extensive ecosystem of partners such as systems integrators and independent software vendors, facilitate the deployment and monetization of these IT-enabled solutions. Amortization of purchased intangibles reflects the fair-value allocation of acquired developed technologies, patents, trade names and trademarks and assumptions about their expected use, and cost of subscription revenue includes media rebill costs, third-party royalties and amortization of intangible assets. Together, these investments in cloud infrastructure, integration of acquired IT resources and continuous product and service innovation underscore our IT capability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure technology and information resources in support of business strategies, work processes and competitive advantage.

The company emphasizes its development and commercialization of proprietary technologies and strategic acquisitions to enhance its technology‐enabled capabilities, noting, for example, the February 2017 acquisition of Finesse Solutions, Inc., a provider of scalable control automation systems and software for bioproduction, and the March 2017 acquisition of Core Informatics, a provider of cloud‐based platforms supporting scientific data management, each of which expanded its software, data management and connectivity resources; it further describes its strategic growth investments as targeted spending to enhance commercial capabilities through expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure and focused research projects, all reflecting the company’s ability to mobilize and deploy IT‐based resources in combination with other assets and work processes to support and enhance its business strategies and customer experience.

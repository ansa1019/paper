Our discussion of online sales—defined as sales generated through our websites for products picked up in our stores or delivered to customer locations—highlights the deployment of digital infrastructure and connectivity, with online sales representing 7.9% of net sales and growing 26.2% in fiscal 2018. We further describe the execution of strategic efforts to drive an enhanced interconnected experience in both the physical and digital worlds, underscoring our coordination of assets, processes and interfirm transactions through digital technologies. We note that digital or otherwise, acquisitions such as Interline are integrated into our comparable sales metric once owned for more than 52 weeks, reflecting our interchannel and interorganizational resource integration. The increase in SG&A as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2018 included $544 million of incremental investments made in the business and $136 million of incremental depreciation, and we forecast approximately $2.7 billion of capital expenditures in fiscal 2019, reflecting our ongoing allocation of resources toward infrastructure capability, process development and operational enhancements that support our firm’s business strategies and work processes.

Technology expenses were higher and headcount increased 6% compared with December 2019, reflecting investments in new business initiatives and an increase in technology professionals. We routinely assess the objectives and effectiveness of our business continuity plan (BCP) and information security program as integral elements of our risk management and liquidity policies. Our systems and infrastructure have been robust throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, enabling us to conduct our activities without disruption, and as part of our vendor management processes we maintain ongoing dialogue with third-party service providers to ensure they continue to meet our business continuity criteria. To support our European operations, the internal infrastructure build-out and external connectivity to financial market infrastructure for our new EU entities is complete, with GSBE connected to and operational on major E.U. exchange, clearing and settlement platforms. In our asset management division we leverage a broad, open-architecture investment platform and global execution capabilities to serve clients, and in our consumer banking business we issue unsecured loans and credit cards through our digital platform, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, while also accepting deposits digitally, illustrating our continued investment in communications, technology and digital infrastructure to meet evolving business needs and enhance client connectivity.

In 2020, the company leveraged technology, data, and process reengineering to enhance safety and network operations, implementing a multi-faceted approach that utilized technology, risk assessments, training, and targeted capital investments to reduce incidents and forming an operating practices command center to identify service interruptions and develop solutions. It continued efforts to utilize data to identify and mitigate risk, detect rail defects, improve or close crossings, and educate stakeholders on crossing safety. Through transportation plan changes, elimination of switches, and improved terminal processes, the company adjusted its demand-driven resources with minimal customer disruption, achieving six-point gains in intermodal and manifest/automotive car trip plan compliance, an eight percent improvement in freight car terminal dwell, and substantial year-over-year metric enhancements including 14 percent locomotive productivity and 11 percent workforce productivity. Looking ahead, the company will continue to transform its service product by further increasing reliability, reducing variability in network operations, and improving resource utilization through the continued implementation of train-length initiatives, structural changes to operational performance and efficiency, and ongoing investments under a new transportation plan designed to generate capacity and support growth and productivity.

Visa is a global payments technology company that leverages innovative technologies to enable secure, reliable electronic payments and facilitate digital payments across a global network of consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities. Its advanced transaction processing network, VisaNet, provides authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions, supports transaction and information processing among clients globally and underpins a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. Data processing revenues reflect the delivery of network access, maintenance and support services, while network and processing expenses relate to the operation, maintenance and ongoing enhancement of its processing infrastructure through equipment rental and fees for data processing services. In fiscal 2020, total operating expenses were driven by higher personnel costs and additional depreciation and amortization arising from ongoing investments, including acquisitions, in support of the company’s strategy for future growth. Treasury policies guide the allocation of resources to planned capital investments and technology assets to sustain and optimize digital and payments system infrastructure. To ensure operational flexibility and continuity of its digital payments services, Visa maintains robust settlement and risk-management systems—including global liquidity and credit exposure limits, a commercial paper program, an unsecured revolving credit facility and a litigation escrow account. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the company transitioned most employees to remote work, underscoring the adaptability of its information systems and connectivity to support business continuity and evolving operational needs.

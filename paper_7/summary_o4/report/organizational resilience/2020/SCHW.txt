In 2020, depreciation and amortization expenses increased due to higher amortization of purchased and internally developed software, elevated technology equipment depreciation arising from the TD Ameritrade acquisition and U.S. campus expansions, and continued capital investment reflected in $453 million of capitalized software costs (up from $188 million in 2019 and $194 million in 2018). Occupancy and equipment expense rose in both 2020 and 2019 as higher client trade volumes and firm growth drove increased technology equipment costs, software maintenance expenses, and additional software licenses. During the second quarter of 2020, the acquisition of Motifâ€™s technology and intellectual property bolstered existing capabilities and accelerated our development of thematic and direct index investing platforms. Throughout 2020, unprecedented client engagement and record trading volumes in a predominantly remote work environment exposed strains on our digital infrastructure, resulting in longer call wait times and intermittent issues accessing our website and mobile applications; accordingly, the company anticipates increased technology spending in 2021 to improve service levels and support continued growth.

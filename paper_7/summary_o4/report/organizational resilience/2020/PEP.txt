Our executive overview describes how we must “further strengthen our e-commerce and digital capabilities” and “reimagine our marketing,” explicitly calling for “necessary investments in our manufacturing capacity, go-to-market systems and digital initiatives, such as improving our presence and scale in our e-commerce business.” We commit to “investing in data analytics that can provide more granularity around consumer insights” and to “continue investing to further expand global business services into new capabilities, which will enable better insight and support for our businesses at a lower cost.” We also “monitor changes in the retail landscape” and “seek to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities, such as expanding our direct-to-consumer business, and distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade.” In our integrated risk management framework, the board of directors “receives updates on key risks throughout the year, including risks related to cybersecurity,” and its designated committees oversee cybersecurity risk management. Further, we “have developed and implemented and continue to develop and implement health and safety protocols, business continuity plans and crisis management protocols in an effort to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 to our employees and our business,” underscoring our reliance on digital infrastructure and information systems capability to support operational resilience.

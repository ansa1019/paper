Mastercard presents itself as a technology company in the global payments industry and operates a proprietary multi-rail network that authorizes, clears and settles transactions while delivering related products and services. The company’s additional payment capabilities include automated clearing house transactions and integrated value-added offerings such as cyber and intelligence products, information and analytics services, consulting, loyalty and reward programs, processing and open banking, highlighting its deployment of digital infrastructure and information management resources to ensure security, connectivity and flexibility across customer networks. Investment in strategic initiatives has driven higher personnel and data processing and telecommunications costs, reflecting continued deployment and enhancement of IT infrastructure to support operational efficiency and evolving business needs. Other revenues, which cover data analytics and consulting fees and cyber-intelligence products, and the recorded data processing expenses within general and administrative costs underscore an organizational focus on mobilizing IT-based resources for business value creation and dynamic capability development. Furthermore, increased depreciation and amortization expense, driven by capital investments and business combinations that allocate purchase price to technology-related intangible assets, illustrates the firm’s ongoing commitment to acquiring, deploying and reconfiguring IT resources in support of growth, competitive positioning and digital transformation.

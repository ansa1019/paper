Management’s discussion and analysis describes a series of resource mobilization and deployment initiatives in support of evolving business strategies that implicitly reflect the firm’s IT capability, including targeted strategic growth investments to enhance commercial capabilities—expanding geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, focused research and development projects and employee incentive programs—and productivity improvements driven by its practical process improvement (PPI) business system, global sourcing initiatives, facility consolidations and low-cost region manufacturing, all of which underscore process optimization, operational flexibility and the leveraging of IT-based systems in coordination with other resources; in addition, the company’s liquidity and capital resource management—including maintenance of $10.33 billion in cash and cash equivalents, a $3 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility with an undrawn liquidity buffer aligned to outstanding commercial paper, disciplined working capital investments in accounts receivable, inventories and timing of incentive compensation payments and customer billings, and structured debt repayments and equity repurchases—demonstrates its competence in allocating financial and intangible resources to support changing business needs and preserve competitive advantage.

The excerpt does not explicitly describe information technology capabilities, but it details extensive information management and analytical processes that implicitly depend on IT capability. Management’s use of adjusted earnings—a non-GAAP measure used internally for financial planning, performance analysis, board reporting and as an input to performance-based compensation—reflects the systematic acquisition, deployment and synthesis of financial data with appropriate accuracy and timeliness. The presentation of net income and earnings per share by reportable segment, the compilation of MD&A in conjunction with notes to consolidated financial statements and the performance graph underscore data aggregation and reporting across multiple business units. Derivative and commodity risk management activities, governed by an Exposure Management Committee, involve real-time mark-to-market valuation, value-at-risk modeling and counterparty credit limit monitoring, implying integrated systems for pricing, forecasting and collateral management. The calculation and monitoring of liquidity and capital resources—through cash-flow projections, credit facility availability, debt issuance programs and credit rating triggers—require coordinated information systems to support capital allocation decisions, regulatory compliance and covenant maintenance. Likewise, pension benefit accounting employs actuarial modeling with assumptions for discount rates, salary increases and expected returns on plan assets, while asset retirement obligations and regulatory asset/liability accounting for nuclear decommissioning and storm reserves demand continuous tracking of long-lived asset costs, accruals and regulatory deferrals. Market risk sensitivity analyses for commodity prices, interest rates and equity prices, along with fair-value measurements of derivative contracts, fixed-income securities and equity securities in decommissioning funds, also depend on sophisticated data management, valuation modeling and scenario analysis. Although the report focuses on energy operations and financial results, these multifaceted processes of data collection, integration, analysis and reporting embody the firm’s competence to mobilize and leverage IT-based resources in support of its strategic objectives and operational efficiency, consistent with an evolving concept of IT capability that coordinates internal processes, assets and interfirm transactions.

We have implemented a number of measures to protect the health and safety of our workforce, including a mandatory work-from-home policy for our global workforce who can perform their jobs from home as well as restrictions on business travel, workplace and in-person meetings; depending on local conditions, our field-based personnel have resumed in-person customer interactions in healthcare settings where it is safe to do so and approved by the government, while our remote engagement model continues to support healthcare professionals, patient care and access to our medicines.  Through our operating model transformation, we have evolved our commercial infrastructure to drive growth by focusing commercial, R&D and manufacturing resources on prioritized brands and markets, strengthening our R&D capabilities in tumor biology, patient selection and new biomarkers, delivering leaner administrative functions, optimizing our manufacturing network to reflect the importance of biologics and streamlining our pricing and information technology infrastructure.  Looking ahead, we will continue to integrate our recently acquired businesses in commercial and R&D areas, realize $3.0 billion of synergies through 2022 across general and administrative, manufacturing, R&D and procurement, and maintain a culture of continuous improvement by investing in our pipeline, biologics manufacturing capabilities and digital infrastructure to enhance operational flexibility, connectivity and responsiveness to evolving business needs.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the company took actions to shift the majority of its workforce to a remote working environment to ensure the continuity of its business, including the sales and delivery of services to clients, enabling approximately 95 percent of its global workforce to work from home and suspending substantially all business travel. It continues to develop and implement its comprehensive plan to return to its and its clients’ offices where permissible, with people’s safety and client needs guiding a phased transition. The firm proactively plans and manages the size and composition of its workforce, hires to meet current and projected demand, evaluates voluntary attrition, adjusts hiring levels, and uses involuntary terminations as needed to balance its supply of skills and resources with changes in client demand, and adjusts compensation to attract and retain qualified employees. It strives to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on margins and to deliver market-leading services while deploying skilled teams effectively. The company manages foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations by using currency protection provisions in customer contracts and hedging programs, and calculates financial results in local currency to facilitate comparisons without the impact of exchange rate volatility.

Liquidity and capital resources are sustained through cash flows from operations, available cash reserves, debt capacity under various credit facilities, and flexible share repurchase programs, supporting share purchases, dividends, acquisitions, service innovation, and future expansion, thereby preserving functionality and performance under internal and external disturbances.

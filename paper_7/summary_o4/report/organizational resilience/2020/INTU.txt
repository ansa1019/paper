In its discussion of industry trends, management observes that artificial intelligence is “transforming multiple industries, including financial technology” as “disruptive start-ups, emerging ecosystems and mega-platforms harness new technology to create personalized experiences, deliver data-driven insights and increase speed of service” in “a more dynamic and highly competitive environment” where services become digitized and customer expectations shift globally. To support this evolution, the Company emphasizes “the ongoing operation and availability of our platforms and systems and those of our external service providers,” and reports that it is “investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities.” The cost of service and other revenue includes direct costs for “data processing and storage capabilities from cloud providers” and the experts who support its QuickBooks Live and TurboTax Live offerings. Further, the Company has “implemented additional security measures” and continues to work with state and federal governments to establish “industry-wide security and anti-fraud measures, including sharing information regarding suspicious filings,” all of which reflect its commitment to mobilizing IT resources, enhancing information management capability, and reinforcing operational flexibility and competitive advantage through coordinated deployment of technology, processes, and organizational resources.

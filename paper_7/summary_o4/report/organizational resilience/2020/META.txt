In our forward-looking discussion, we indicate that we intend to continue to invest in our business based on our company priorities and anticipate that additional investments in our data center capacity, servers, network infrastructure, and office facilities, as well as scaling our headcount to support our growth, will drive expense growth in 2021. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products, including the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as facility and server equipment depreciation, salaries, benefits and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs, as well as partner arrangement costs for traffic acquisition and content, credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, and the cost of consumer hardware devices sold. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, share-based compensation and facilities-related costs for employees on our engineering and technical teams responsible for building new products and improving existing products. In the second quarter of 2020, we updated our family metrics calculations to reflect recent data from a periodic WhatsApp user survey and to incorporate certain methodology improvements that we estimate contributed approximately 40 million daily active people and 50 million monthly active people to our reported worldwide metrics. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications, recognizing impression-based ad revenue in the period in which the impressions are delivered—defined as when an ad is displayed to a user—and action-based ad revenue in the period in which a user takes the contracted action, and calculating price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered. Our calculations of daily active people and monthly active people rely upon complex techniques, algorithms and machine learning models to estimate the underlying number of unique individuals using one or more of our products, including matching user accounts within and across products when attributable to a single person, which requires significant judgment, internal reviews and calibration against survey data, resulting in inherent estimation error. We currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs—including these investments—and to fund our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future.

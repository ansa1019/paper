In 2020, the company significantly enhanced its IT capability by enabling a largely remote workforce through secure connectivity and internal geo-location systems, by building and operating its proprietary Open Connect global content-delivery network and related equipment, and by leveraging third-party cloud-computing services to ensure scalable, reliable streaming; technology and development expenses increased 18 percent to $1.83 billion, driven principally by payroll and related expenses for technology personnel and by investments in computer hardware and software to test, maintain and modify the user interface, recommendation and merchandising systems, streaming delivery technology and infrastructure; these coordinated investments in IT resources, human capital and business process understanding supported cost efficiencies as technology and development and delivery costs grew more slowly than revenues, underscoring the firmâ€™s competence in mobilizing and reconfiguring IT resources in support of service innovation, information reliability and strategic business objectives.

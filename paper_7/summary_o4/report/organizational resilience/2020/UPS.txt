During 2020, as part of our customer-first, people-led, innovation-driven strategy aimed at transforming nearly every aspect of our business, we completed enhancements to our U.S. ground network to improve time-in-transit and continued to deploy our digital access program into e-commerce platforms, investments to which we partially attribute the significant increase in business-to-consumer shipping; depreciation and amortization expense rose reflecting investments in facility automation, capacity expansion and internally developed software, while professional fees increased primarily in support of information technology and related business services. We also refined our bond-matching approach for pension discount rate determination by implementing advances in technology and modeling techniques, and our ongoing investment program anticipates additional technology initiatives and network capability expansions to further bolster speed, connectivity and operational flexibility in response to evolving customer and market needs.

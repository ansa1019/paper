We define comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year, and we believe we have been successful historically in adapting our business to changes in competition and market conditions through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mixâ€”including increasing penetration of private-label items and through online offerings. Our e-commerce business, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales, achieving a 50 percent increase in e-commerce comparable sales in 2020 (80 percent in the second half of the year), although it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse business. Throughout the pandemic, our e-commerce operations have benefited as more members have shopped online, which, together with shifts in core merchandise categories, has led to improved gross margin and SG&A percentages as we leveraged these digital sales to achieve greater efficiency. Capital expenditures include investment in information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations and working capital; in 2020 we invested $2,810 million and currently intend to invest approximately $3,000 to $3,200 million in fiscal 2021 to support our expanding information systems capability and overall growth initiatives.

Abbott continually implemented business continuity plans in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic by mobilizing its teams across multiple fronts to develop and launch new diagnostic tests, conducting the majority of office-based work remotely under strict travel restrictions, entering a new phase of operations with rotational on-site staffing as governmental orders evolved, and taking aggressive steps to limit exposure and enhance facility safety to sustain operations under unexpected pressures. These adaptive measures allowed the company to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity by reallocating internal knowledge and resources to rapidly increase testing capacity, reconfigure workflows to meet surging demand, innovate service offerings across diagnostics, medical devices, nutritionals and pharmaceuticals, and maintain supply-chain integrity. Abbottâ€™s strong operating cash flows, excess tax benefits, available credit facilities and disciplined debt management preserved liquidity, maintained an investment-grade rating, supported ongoing R&D spending targeted at resilient growth platforms, and enabled continued dividends and share repurchases, thereby reinforcing its systemic resilience, operational flexibility and capacity to respond effectively to external disruptions and emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

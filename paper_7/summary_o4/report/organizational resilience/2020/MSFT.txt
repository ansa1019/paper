Microsoft’s technology platforms and tools drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness and public-sector efficiency by coordinating cloud-based services, software licensing, device manufacturing and online advertising in support of diverse customer needs. The company generates revenue through a comprehensive portfolio of subscription-based cloud offerings—Office 365 commercial and consumer services, Azure consumption-based services, Dynamics 365, server products, LinkedIn, enterprise and support services—licensed under multi-year volume licensing programs and recognized ratably over contract terms, reflecting a strategic shift from on-premises products to cloud deployments. In fiscal 2020, investments in datacenter infrastructure, cloud engineering, research and development in artificial intelligence, LinkedIn integration, GitHub, devices and gaming, as well as expanded sales and marketing capacity and acquisitions, underpinned 24 percent growth in Office 365 commercial seats, 56 percent growth in Azure, and significant increases in cloud revenue and gross margins. The company continues to redeploy engineering resources and leverage hybrid, premium and consumption-based solutions to enhance connectivity, security, reliability, timeliness and scalability of its services, while capital expenditures on new facilities, datacenters and computer systems are expected to rise to support ongoing cloud expansion. Critical accounting judgments around performance obligations and stand-alone selling prices for integrated desktop and cloud services underscore the complexity of Microsoft’s IT service model. These organizational and operational capabilities underscore the firm’s competence in mobilizing IT resources and combining them with management skills, business process understanding and human capital to support and transform business strategies, deliver information with appropriate accuracy and access, and sustain competitive advantage amid dynamic industry shifts and remote work requirements.

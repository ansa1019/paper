Our disclosures describe a multifaceted approach to maintaining organizational resilience through strategic investments, risk mitigation and operational flexibility. We integrate newly acquired businesses into our digital experience and digital media segments, allocate resources to expand cloud-based and on-device offerings, and continuously evaluate critical accounting estimates—such as revenue recognition, purchase price allocations and deferred tax assets—against unanticipated events and circumstances that may affect performance. We employ foreign currency hedges and reserves for uncertain tax positions, maintain a $1 billion revolving credit facility and issue senior notes to ensure liquidity and support ongoing capital expenditures, including R&D and facilities, while structured stock repurchase agreements enable disciplined capital management. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we prioritized employee health and safety and ensured business continuity by directing work-from-home, suspending travel and converting in-person events to digital formats, actions that sustained our subscription-based recurring revenue growth and preserved operational continuity amid extreme conditions. These measures, together with our ecosystem of partners, direct sales force and hedging programs, reinforce our capacity to absorb strain, adapt to environmental disruptions and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions.

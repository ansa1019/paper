Management’s discussion highlights that the company’s main areas of focus include information technology, including cybersecurity, and that it provides a broad range of system integration and cybersecurity services; it also notes that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted operations through travel and transport restrictions, site access limitations and the impacts of remote work and adjusted work schedules, prompting implementation of a flexible teleworking policy that enables a significant portion of the workforce to perform customer commitments remotely; capital expenditures for 2020 and those planned for 2021 include investments in information technology to support both program-specific needs and general enterprise IT infrastructure, including development and purchase of internal-use software; and the 2020 net loss from discontinued operations reflects a non-cash charge related to certain tax matters of the former information systems & global solutions business divested in 2016.

Managementâ€™s discussion highlights significant information technology investments and resources that support and enable business strategies and operational processes, reflecting an evolving IT capability encompassing coordination of assets, internal processes and interfirm relationships. We continue to invest heavily in land and buildings for data centers and offices and in information technology assets, which includes servers and network equipment, to support the long-term growth of our business and enable products such as ads, search, YouTube and Google Cloud. In 2020 we spent $22.3 billion on capital expenditures, primarily on technical infrastructure including servers and network equipment, and recognized $2.8 billion in operating lease assets. Our Google Cloud segment, which includes infrastructure and data analytics platforms, collaboration tools and other services, grew by $4.1 billion, driven by GCP infrastructure and analytics offerings and our Google Workspace collaboration tools, underscoring our competence in deploying and reconfiguring IT resources to meet changing business needs. Trends in the digital economy, including the shift from offline to online and the proliferation of diverse devices and modalities, have driven ongoing enhancements to our product and advertising formats, delivery mechanisms and monetization metrics; as a result we periodically refine our methodologies for monitoring, gathering and counting paid clicks and impressions to better align information management with revenue performance. The company also continues to make significant R&D investments in areas of strategic focus such as advertising, cloud, machine learning and search, and, in response to Covid-19 and accelerating digital transformation, remains focused on innovating and investing in go-to-market capabilities, product development and technical infrastructure around the globe to support long-term growth.

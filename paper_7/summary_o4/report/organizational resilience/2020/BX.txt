Throughout the discussion and analysis, the company highlights its focus on maintaining “seamless functioning” under challenging conditions by rapidly shifting the majority of its global workforce to remote operations, supported by a “robust” technology infrastructure, rigorous protocols for work-from-home (including frequent leadership communications, group calls and updates) and the continued convening of investment committees to preserve uninterrupted decision-making across investment, asset management and corporate support functions. Management underscores its commitment to employee safety and wellbeing through voluntary office returns with “testing, contact-tracing and social distancing and other safety protocols” and ongoing monitoring of public-health and government guidance to adapt office protocols. In response to pandemic-driven “liquidity issues” and “dramatic declines in global equity and credit markets,” the firm has relied on multiple liquidity sources—including a $2.25 billion revolver, senior notes issuances and its “primary focus” on operational continuity—to absorb market strain, preserve financial flexibility and position for recovery as fiscal and monetary stimulus measures and vaccine distribution bolster a reopening economy that remains “uneven” and “uncertain.”

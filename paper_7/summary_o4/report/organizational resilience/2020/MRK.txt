Merck’s animal health segment offers “an extensive suite of digitally connected identification, traceability and monitoring products,” reflecting the application of digital technologies to coordinate assets, processes and external relationships. In executing its strategic priorities, the company “actively monitors the business development landscape for growth opportunities that meet the company’s strategic criteria,” allocates resources “to support its commercial opportunities in the near term while making the necessary investments to support long-term growth,” and relies on employees “across the organization” to enroll and maintain clinical studies, progress its pipeline and ensure supply and patient access to its portfolio, all of which imply underlying information management capabilities to integrate resources, processes and interfirm transactions in support of business strategies.

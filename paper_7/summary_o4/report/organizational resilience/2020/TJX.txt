In fiscal 2021 and into fiscal 2022, TJX underscored its reliance on and investment in information technology platforms and systems to support its business strategies and operational growth, maintaining all of its e-commerce businesses—including TKMaxx.com in the U.K.—during temporary store closures and reopening phases, having launched online shopping at Marshalls.com in fiscal 2020 and announcing an expansion to HomeGoods.com in late fiscal 2022, with e-commerce representing approximately 3% to 5% of segment sales; realigning its European division’s supply chain in response to Brexit and establishing the resources and systems necessary to support this reconfiguration; and budgeting capital expenditures of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion for fiscal 2022, of which approximately $0.7 billion to $0.8 billion is earmarked for offices and distribution centers—including buying and merchandising systems and other information systems—to underpin infrastructure enhancements and future growth.

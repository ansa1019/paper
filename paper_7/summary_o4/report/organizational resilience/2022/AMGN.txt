Amgen’s MD&A describes how the company has closely monitored its global operations and clinical trial activities—collecting and evaluating data on COVID-19 infection rates and pandemic impacts, mitigating effects on future study enrollment and supply continuity—and notes that its remote working arrangements have not significantly affected its ability to maintain critical business operations or medicine supplies, implying deployment of IT-enabled connectivity and collaboration capabilities. The company monitors wholesaler inventory levels through data obtained from its distributors and third parties to ensure appropriate stock levels aligned to end-user demand, reflecting information management processes across its supply chain. To manage financial risks, Amgen has entered into cross-currency and interest rate swap contracts that convert foreign-currency and fixed-rate obligations into U.S. dollar and floating-rate exposures, indicative of integrated treasury and risk-management systems. Its investment policy prescribes safety, liquidity and risk parameters for marketable securities, while its disciplined capital allocation framework governs strategic evaluations of internal and external innovation investments, strategic transactions, dividend and share-repurchase decisions and debt management, underscoring decision-support processes and resource deployment aligned with business strategies. The amendment of its Puerto Rico tax grant to secure an alternative fixed tax rate under new regulations further demonstrates adaptive governance and reporting infrastructure. Across these disclosures, Amgen applies data-driven monitoring, coordinated resource deployment and process controls to support and enhance its operations and strategic objectives.

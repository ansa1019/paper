During fiscal 2022, the company absorbed strain and preserved its operations under challenging conditions by responding to a fire that destroyed one U.S. store while opening six new stores across the U.S. and Mexico and by proactively addressing ongoing global supply chain disruptions through strategic investments to promote higher in-stock levels, pull forward seasonal inventory, and expand new supply chain facilities. The generation of $14.6 billion of operating cash flow and maintenance of $2.8 billion in cash and equivalents, together with expansion of the commercial paper program from $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion and the establishment of five-year and 364-day backup credit facilities, reinforced business continuity, operational flexibility, and financial resilience. A disciplined capital allocation framework prioritized approximately $3.1 billion of capital expenditures, funded dividend payments of $7.8 billion, and supported $6.7 billion of share repurchases, while new senior note issuances of $7.0 billion and repayments of outstanding indebtedness ensured access to long-term debt markets. Working capital management actions, including inventory investment decisions initiated in fiscal 2021 and moderated in the second half of fiscal 2022, reflected a systemic approach to mitigate external pressures and maintain performance. Aggregate lease obligations of $14.7 billion and purchase commitments of $1.8 billion further demonstrated the companyâ€™s capacity to deploy resources and reconfigure operations in response to environmental perturbations. The company affirmed that its cash position, operational liquidity, and access to alternative financing sources should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, contractual obligations, and strategic initiatives over the next several fiscal years, reflecting its ability to maintain positive adjustment, preserve integrity, and emerge stronger from disruptions.

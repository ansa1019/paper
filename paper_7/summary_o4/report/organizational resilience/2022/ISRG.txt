The discussion describes how, in the face of macroeconomic uncertainty, inflationary pressures, supply chain constraints, labor shortages, the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has taken steps to absorb strain and maintain functionality by engaging in activities to seek to mitigate supply disruptions, supporting its customers according to their priorities—clinical, operational, and economic—and ensuring continuity of supply by working with suppliers and distributors. It implemented a customer relief program that delivered service fee credits, deferred lease payments, and extended payment terms, and it introduced alternative financing structures, including sales-type and operating leases and usage-based arrangements, to provide customers with operational flexibility. The company also issued a voluntary field action to replace a defective component without material impact, demonstrating proactive risk mitigation. Internally, it focused on the health and safety of patients, customers, communities, and employees by implementing continuous updates to health and safety policies and processes, secured its workforce economically by building and investing in a valuable team for pandemic recovery, and collected internal and external insights to inform decision-making on return-to-office work models that align with evolving work environments. It committed to continued investment in priority development programs while eliminating avoidable spend, extended the use of instruments to reduce customer costs, and took a holistic, integrated approach—offering intelligent technology, readiness, on-demand support, and analytics services—to decrease variability, optimize efficiency, and adapt its resource configuration, all of which reflect systemic perspective, adaptive strategies, and resilience mechanisms targeted at preserving performance and enabling positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

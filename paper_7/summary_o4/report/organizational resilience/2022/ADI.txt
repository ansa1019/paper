We sell our products globally through a direct sales force, third-party distributors, independent sales representatives and via our website, reflecting the deployment of digital channels in our value chain. The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points—including technical characteristics, “sold-to” customer information, “ship-to” customer information and the end-customer application—and as data systems for capturing and tracking this data and our methodology evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time.

Technology is the foundation of our company, and our strategy to maximize long-term free cash flow per share growth includes a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology that provides lower costs and greater control of our supply chain, a broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products that offers more opportunity per customer and more value for our investments, the reach of our market channels that gives access to more customers and more of their design projects and gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs, and the diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions that provide less single point dependency and longer returns on our investments; we make our investments with an eye towards long-term strengthening and leveraging of these advantages. Discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities spans how we select R&D projects, develop new capabilities like ti.com, invest in new manufacturing capacity or think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners. Efficiency means constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent. During a sustained period of market uncertainty and a weakening demand environment, we continue to manage our operating plan and expenses with a steady hand as we focus on long-term investments to strengthen our competitive advantages while monitoring potential impacts on our operations. As part of our long-term capacity planning, capital expenditures for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and facilities—including the purchase of our 300-mm factory in Lehi, Utah—are expected to exceed historical levels. Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations supplemented by cash, short-term investments and a variable-rate, revolving credit facility; we believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months.

The company acknowledges that global macroeconomic conditions—in particular fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, inflation, disruptions in the global supply chain, the effects of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and trade regulations—could materially affect its ability to deliver products and services and maintain its financial condition, having already observed increased shortages and delays in components such as semiconductors, paper and plastic that may impede future procurement. To support operational continuity and preserve performance under these pressures, the company generates the majority of its revenue from recurring account- and transaction-based fees under multi-year contracts with high renewal rates and continually reviews its portfolio of acquisitions and dispositions to ensure necessary business assets are deployed in alignment with strategic objectives, enhance scale, achieve cost and revenue synergies, and change industry dynamics. The company’s purpose is to deliver superior client value through leading technology, targeted innovation and excellence in everything it does, focusing on solution integration, operational excellence, disciplined capital allocation and breakthrough innovation to adapt to evolving market demands. Liquidity and capital resources are managed to fund operating expenses, service outstanding indebtedness and finance capital expenditures through operating cash flow, available cash and cash equivalents, committed revolving credit facilities—including a $6 billion multicurrency facility—and commercial paper programs, providing the financial flexibility to refinance maturing obligations and respond to unexpected financing needs. Financial risk management practices include annual reviews of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment under both qualitative and quantitative methods, fair-value determinations based on discount rates, growth forecasts and market conditions, the establishment and periodic adjustment of liabilities for tax exposures and joint venture debt guarantees, and active monitoring of debt covenant compliance, all of which support the company’s ability to absorb strain, mitigate risks, maintain integrity and emerge stronger from challenging situations.

The Company’s digital media and digital experience offerings rely fundamentally on integrated IT capabilities that coordinate its technology resources, internal processes and interfirm relationships.  In Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, the Company “provides access to a solution that integrates cloud-based and on-premise/on-device features that, together through their integration, provide functionalities, utility and workflow efficiencies” such as Creative Cloud Libraries, shared reviews, automatic cloud rendering and Sensei, its AI/ML framework, all of which exemplify the firm’s ability to acquire, deploy and reconfigure IT resources to support business strategies and work processes.  Underpinning subscription revenue, the Company incurs significant third-party hosting services and data center costs and maintains network infrastructure to ensure connectivity, reliability, security and scalability.  The adoption of a data-driven operating model (“DDOM”) and the Adobe Experience Cloud solutions illustrate the firm’s information management capability to provide timely, accurate and actionable customer data, including Adobe Analytics, Customer Journey Analytics and its real-time Customer Data Platform, to optimize customer acquisition, engagement and retention.  Significant investments in research and development—primarily software development, data center capacity and computer equipment—along with acquisitions of cloud-native collaboration tools such as Frame.io and the Workfront workflow platform, demonstrate the firm’s enterprise-wide mobilization of IT-based resources to drive innovation, process optimization and competitive advantage.  The Company’s subscription-based recognition policies, usage-based performance obligations and digital infrastructure commitments further reflect its management capability to tailor these IT services in response to changing business needs and to enhance organizational agility and market responsiveness.

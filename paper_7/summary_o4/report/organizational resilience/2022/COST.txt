We believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to economic and competitive changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items and through online offerings, and by working with our suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases, engaging in earlier-than-usual and higher-volume purchasing, and offering seasonal merchandise outside its season or, when necessary, passing cost increases on to our members. We leverage increases in comparable sales to reduce SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales, enhance profitability, and build liquidity, while maintaining a membership format designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue under varying market conditions. Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs—particularly in areas partially outside our control such as health care and utilities—by absorbing wage and benefit increases to reduce turnover and enhance employee satisfaction, and by monitoring and responding to fluctuations in gasoline prices and foreign-exchange rates, recognizing their impacts on net sales, gross margin, and SG&A expenses. To support operational flexibility and business continuity under pressures such as inflation, tariffs, supply and logistics constraints related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and other external disturbances, we maintain cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, bank credit facilities, commercial paper programs, and self-insurance mechanisms—including a captive insurance subsidiary and participation in reinsurance programs—to mitigate exposure to hazards and claims. We fund capital expenditures for new and remodeled warehouses, information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, and working capital through cash from operations and available credit, thereby preserving or improving our performance and integrity while under internal or external variations and disturbances.

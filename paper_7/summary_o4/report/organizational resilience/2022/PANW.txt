Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis describes our cybersecurity platforms and services that secure enterprise users, networks, clouds, and endpoints by delivering comprehensive cybersecurity backed by industry-leading artificial intelligence and automation and next-generation zero trust network access, underscoring our capability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources to support secure remote workforces and end-to-end infrastructure protection. Our security solutions are designed to reduce customers’ total cost of ownership by improving operational efficiency and eliminating siloed point products, while our subscriptions provide end-customers with near real-time access to antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, modern malware prevention, data loss prevention, and cloud access security broker capabilities across the network, endpoints, and the cloud, reflecting our information management capability to deliver data and services with appropriate accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access. Through add-on security services, end-customers are able to secure content, applications, users, and devices across our network security platform as well as the Prisma and Cortex product lines, and our ML-powered next-generation firewall incorporates the PAN-OS operating system to provide a consistent set of capabilities across form factors, while our VM-series virtual firewalls and CN-series container firewalls deliver equivalent functionality in virtualized and container environments, illustrating our dynamic IT infrastructure capability. We continue to invest in innovation to evolve and further extend the capabilities of our portfolio, introducing new offerings such as Prisma Cloud 3.0, Prisma Access 3.0, AIOps for NGFW, PAN-OS 10.2, and Cloud NGFW for AWS during fiscal 2022, as we believe that timely development of new features and products is essential to meeting customer needs and improving our competitive position. We believe our growth and success depend on our ability to extend technology leadership, expand deployment of our portfolio and support offerings, and focus on end-customer satisfaction, and to manage future growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes efficiently. In response to COVID-19, we instituted a global work-from-home policy and provided technology to our employees, end-customers, and partners to enable remote operations, demonstrating operational flexibility and connectivity, and we manage supply chain challenges, including chip and component shortages, to ensure continuity of our hardware-based IT resources.

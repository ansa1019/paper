Prologis’ Management’s Discussion and Analysis repeatedly refers to its structured use of data and analytics—presenting year-over-year trends in operating metrics through graphs, segmenting net operating income by real estate and strategic capital lines, reconciling segment results to GAAP operating income, and reporting key operating metrics such as occupancy rates and net effective rent changes—which implicitly relies on information management capabilities to provide accurate, timely and reliable performance data. The firm’s allocation of property management and leasing costs across real estate and strategic capital segments based on square footage, its defined “same store” analysis population, and its reconciliation of straight-line rent and fair value lease adjustments further suggest a systematic information processing capacity underpinning cost-allocation, performance measurement and forecasting. References to fair value measurements for acquisitions and impairments using discounted cash flows, the tracking of equity commitments across co-investment ventures, and the use of derivative instruments for hedging foreign currency and interest rate risk all presume robust IT-supported analytics and information systems to integrate market data, model future cash flows and inform capital deployment decisions. Moreover, the availability of financial statements on the SEC’s website and the company’s investor relations portal highlights the firm’s digital infrastructure for disseminating tailored, connected data to stakeholders in support of its strategic and operational decision-making.

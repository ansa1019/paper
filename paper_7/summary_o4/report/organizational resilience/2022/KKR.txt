KKR & Co. Inc. reports that its asset management and insurance businesses are materially affected by economic and market conditions across the United States, the EU, China, Japan and other regions, including the adverse impacts of monetary and fiscal policy tightening, inflationary headwinds, higher interest rates and foreign exchange volatility on investment valuations, exit opportunities and corporate profits, and that global and regional economic conditions can each have a substantial impact on its business, financial condition and results of operations. Despite various economic headwinds, several key economic indicators in the U.S., including employment, have demonstrated resilience in 2022. The company highlights the effects of supply-chain bottlenecks—ranging from dynamic zero-COVID policies to shifting Russia-Ukraine supply chains—and the proliferation of laws restricting foreign direct investment, which have contributed to substantial market volatility, equity and credit market declines and increased pressures on labor supply. In the eurozone, disruptions to European energy markets and related sanctions have exacerbated oil and gas price volatility and spurred protectionist export restrictions globally. KKR also notes that higher interest rates, slower growth and weaker currencies in certain emerging markets have increased default risk and that central bank quantitative easing or tightening campaigns may lead to further currency volatility, while recognizing that tightening liquidity conditions in equity and credit capital markets can adversely impact the availability and cost of capital for its portfolio companies. In its insurance operations, KKR manages market risk through hedging strategies for equity-sensitive annuity and indexed universal life products, actively monitors credit and interest-rate risks in its portfolio, including funds-withheld arrangements that require fair-value measurement of embedded derivatives, and seeks to maintain operating flexibility by matching asset and liability cash flows and reviewing actuarial assumptions. Across its businesses, KKR employs non-GAAP performance measures and key operating metrics to assess productivity, resource deployment and risk mitigation, allocates capital based on expected returns and market multiples, and pursues strategic initiatives to preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions, adapt to environmental disruptions, manage unexpected situations and maintain positive adjustment and continuity of operations in volatile and extreme conditions.

As part of its enterprise-wide IBOR transition program, the corporation launched capabilities and services to support the issuance of and trading in products indexed to various alternative reference rates and developed employee training programs and other information sources on the challenges and opportunities presented, while driving technology and operations modifications, including updates to its operational models, systems and processes. The MD&A further recognizes that operational risk arises from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems and that a failure or disruption in or breach of the corporation’s operational or security systems or infrastructure, including as a result of cyber-attacks or campaigns, could adversely affect the corporation’s operations and highlights the importance of mobilizing IT-based resources to support and enhance business strategies and work processes.

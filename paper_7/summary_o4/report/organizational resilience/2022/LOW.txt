In fiscal 2022, we generated $8.6 billion in cash from operating activities and deployed $1.8 billion in capital expenditures—approximately 75 percent on existing store investments, 15 percent on strategic initiatives such as enhanced labor management tools, store inventory management systems and pricing capabilities, and 10 percent on new stores and corporate facilities—while converting 11 geographic areas to a market-based delivery model that bypasses stores to improve supply chain flexibility and operational continuity; we repurchased $14.1 billion of common stock, paid $2.4 billion in dividends and maintained $1.3 billion of cash plus $3.5 billion of undrawn credit capacity under our revolving credit facilities to ensure liquidity under internal or external variations and disruptions; we launched the MVPS Pro Rewards and Partnership Program, enhanced pro product and service assortments, and invested $170 million in annual wage increases and discretionary and profit-sharing bonuses for front-line associates to bolster organizational health and human capital resilience; upon selling our Canadian retail business, we recorded a $2.1 billion pre-tax impairment of long-lived assets and $441 million of transaction costs, reconfiguring our asset portfolio to simplify our business model, sharpen our focus on U.S. home improvement demand drivers such as disposable personal income, home price appreciation and aging housing stock, and strengthen our ability to maintain performance under adverse conditions; we continued perpetual productivity improvement initiatives that delivered efficiencies and supported operating margin integrity, managed risk through self-insurance programs, inventory shrink reserves and vendor fund accruals to preserve system integrity, and demonstrated our capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning—evidenced by adjusted diluted earnings per share of $13.81 and a return on invested capital of 30.4 percent—supported by investment-grade credit ratings to sustain access to capital markets in challenging environments.

In fiscal 2022, Starbucks expanded its IT capability through strategic technology investments and digital innovations across its operations: under the U.S. reinvention plan, the acceleration of purpose-built store concepts and innovations in technologies was designed to increase efficiency and elevate the partner and customer experience by providing additional convenience and connection; outside of China, strong growth in key international markets was driven by product innovation and increasing digital capabilities; other operating expenses reflected strategic investments in technology and related initiatives alongside higher support costs for its growing North America and international licensed stores; general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to incremental investments in technology; and unallocated corporate expenses similarly rose in part from incremental technology investments, underscoring the firmâ€™s ongoing efforts to acquire, deploy and leverage IT resources in support of its business strategies and work processes.

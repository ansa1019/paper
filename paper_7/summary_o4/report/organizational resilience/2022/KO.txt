Management notes that despite ongoing negative impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical disruptions such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the company remains focused on executing for growth by investing in its portfolio of brands, strategic capabilities and people, and by pursuing strategic priorities including innovation, data-driven revenue growth management and embedding sustainability into operations. It emphasizes the maintenance of business continuity and operational flexibility through rigorous risk mitigation and quality management processes, integrated quality and ingredient safety standards, and ongoing recoverability and impairment tests of assets under varying economic and supply-chain conditions. The company continuously monitors its operating environment, adapting pricing, product and channel mix to meet evolving consumer preferences, supporting resilience through e-commerce investments, scalable innovation pipelines and aligned supply-chain financing programs that leverage extended vendor payment terms and receivables factoring to preserve liquidity. A diversified operating structure with geographic segments and strategic acquisitions, divestitures and license agreements facilitates reconfiguration of resource deployment and structural changes to optimize performance under external pressures. Financial resilience is underpinned by strong cash flow generation, access to commercial paper and backup credit lines, active debt management including LIBOR transition planning and hedging activities to mitigate foreign currency and interest-rate variability, and a disciplined capital allocation framework that balances reinvestment, dividend growth and share repurchases. Sustainability focus areas and engagement with stakeholders, coupled with adaptability in accounting judgments and tax litigation contingencies, further illustrate the companyâ€™s ability to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning, and maintain system integrity during nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

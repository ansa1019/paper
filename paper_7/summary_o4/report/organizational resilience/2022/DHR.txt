Danaher’s management emphasizes that its global, diversified operations are increasingly shaped by rapid technological development—particularly in computing, automation, artificial intelligence, mobile connectivity, communications and digitization—which in turn drives the company’s strategic allocation of resources, investment decisions and organizational processes. To address these evolving business needs and market dynamics, the company is making significant investments, both organically and through acquisitions, in its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing infrastructure worldwide in order to improve operational efficiency, responsiveness to customers and overall firm performance. Management continually monitors key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and market outlook, and employs both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures—such as core sales growth that adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and currency translation—to analyze revenue trends, guide executive incentive programs and support strategic decision-making. The MD&A disclosures further describe the company’s use of derivative financial instruments, debt financing and currency risk management tools to maintain financial flexibility, as well as its deployment of diagnostic and bioprocessing capabilities to support critical health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic, underscoring Danaher’s emphasis on mobilizing and configuring technology-enabled resources in combination with organizational know-how to sustain competitive advantage and drive long-term shareholder value.

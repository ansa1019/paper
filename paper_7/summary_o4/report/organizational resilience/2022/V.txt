Visa is a global payments technology company that facilitates global commerce and money movement across more than 200 countries and territories through innovative technologies, providing transaction processing services via VisaNet, its advanced transaction processing network, and offering products and solutions that facilitate secure, reliable, and efficient money movement for all participants in the ecosystem. Service revenues and data processing revenues are driven by nominal payments volume and processed transactions, respectively, reflecting the central role of Visa’s IT infrastructure in enabling core operations. Network and processing expenses, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services, along with depreciation and amortization of purchased and internally developed software, underscore ongoing investments in technology assets and payments system infrastructure. Professional fees increased primarily due to consulting fees related to technology integration and other corporate projects, and other revenues growth was supported by value-added services tied to marketing and consulting. Visa continues to expand its digital platform capabilities through acquisitions, including Currencycloud’s cross-border foreign exchange platform and Tink’s open banking platform, and maintains contractual commitments for software licenses and related purchase obligations, all of which reflect its strategy to mobilize, deploy and enhance its IT-based resources in support of business strategies, operational efficiency and business innovation.

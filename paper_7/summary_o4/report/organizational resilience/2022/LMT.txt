The Company reports that it operates in a complex and evolving global security environment and has adopted a strategy to design and develop platforms and systems that meet future requirements by accelerating the adoption of advanced networking and leading-edge technologies, integrating new and existing systems across all domains, and making forces more agile, adaptive and unpredictable. Key enablers of this strategy include the development of differentiating technologies, the forging of strategic partnerships, execution of a multi-year business transformation initiative to enhance digital infrastructure and increase efficiencies and collaboration, and the maintenance of fiscal discipline. Underpinning its ability to execute is an ongoing, substantial investment in talent and culture to ensure the workforce has the technical skills necessary to succeed, together with continued internal investment in innovative technologies that address rapidly evolving mission requirements. In pursuit of portfolio resilience, the Company continuously evaluates its businesses through independent R&D, strategic acquisitions, divestitures and internal realignments, while deepening connections to commercial industry via cooperative partnerships, joint ventures and equity investments to reconfigure resources and broaden capabilities. In response to COVID-19-related disruptions, the Company accelerated $1.5 billion of payments to its suppliers—prioritizing small and at-risk businesses—deployed dedicated resources at supplier sites to improve oversight, actively engaged with customers, and implemented health and safety measures, while continuing to monitor supply chain risks and the potential need for further mitigations in 2023. To address heightened inflation and interest-rate pressures, the Company has factored higher costs into contract pricing using Department of Defense escalation indices, is seeking economic price adjustment clauses in fixed-price contracts, and remains committed to improving operational efficiency and cost competitiveness to offset cost increases. In the context of geopolitical tensions arising from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Company has evaluated capacity in its operations and supply chain to anticipate demand for critical capabilities, has bolstered its defensive cyber posture against an increased threat environment, and has issued force majeure notices and evaluated contract restructuring options to mitigate the risk of indirect supply chain and performance disruptions caused by sanctions. The Company maintains liquidity through cash and cash equivalents, access to a $3 billion revolving credit facility, commercial paper issuances and letters of credit, and it actively manages its capital structure via debt issuance, targeted refinancing of upcoming maturities, and share repurchase authorizations funded by operations and debt to preserve financial flexibility. To reduce pension-related volatility and funding risk, the Company completed pension risk transfer transactions in 2021 and 2022, transferring $4.9 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, of defined benefit obligations and related assets to an insurance company, thereby improving long-term liability management. Environmental remediation obligations are continually assessed and estimated liabilities recorded as they become probable, with recoverability of costs evaluated under U.S. government regulations and corresponding recoveries recognized in pricing of products and services, reflecting ongoing risk assessment and cost-management strategies.

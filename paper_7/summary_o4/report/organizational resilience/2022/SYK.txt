Our operations have been adversely impacted by the inflationary pressures primarily related to labor, steel and transportation costs as well as the impact of purchasing electronic components at premium prices on the spot market, highlighting challenges in coordinating technology resources and internal processes. Research, development and engineering expenses as a percentage of net sales increased, reflecting our continued investment in innovation and integration of recent acquisitions. In February 2022 we completed the acquisition of Vocera for a purchase price of $2.6 billion; Vocera is a leader in the digital care coordination and communication category, and goodwill attributable to the acquisition reflects the strategic benefits of expanding our presence in adjacent markets, diversifying our product portfolio, advancing innovations, and accelerating our digital aspirations. Selling, general and administrative expenses included charges for certain commercial and regulatory milestones related to technology acquired in the purchase of Mobius Imaging and Cardan Robotics that were no longer probable and a charge for share-based awards vesting for Vocera employees, underscoring our focus on technology deployment, capability integration and the application of specialized human and intangible resources to support digital transformation and drive competitive advantage.

The discussion notes that the Company’s digital retail presence includes five branded e-commerce sites (tjmaxx.com, marshalls.com, sierra.com, homegoods.com and others) which, although representing less than three to five percent of total net sales in fiscal 2022 and 2023, reflect ongoing investments in digital channels and underlying information systems; planned capital expenditures of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion for fiscal 2024 include approximately $0.9 billion to $1.0 billion for offices and distribution centers—specifically “buying and merchandising systems and other information systems” to support growth—which underscores the firm’s focus on integrating technology infrastructure with supply-chain and merchandising operations; additionally, investments in supply-chain enhancements are reflected in cost of sales, and processes such as foreign currency translation and inventory-related hedging rely on system-based monitoring and data management, evidencing the mobilization of IT resources in coordination with the Company’s asset and operational processes.

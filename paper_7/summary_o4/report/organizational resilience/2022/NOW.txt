ServiceNow’s management discussion describes the Now Platform as a comprehensive technology infrastructure that “seamlessly connects workflows across siloed organizations and systems in a way that unlocks productivity, improves experiences for both employees and customers and delivers real business outcomes,” enabling customers’ digital transformation “from non-integrated enterprise technology solutions with manual and disconnected processes and activities, to integrated enterprise technology solutions with automation and connected processes and activities” and thereby increasing resiliency, security and value. Cost of subscription revenues explicitly reflects the firm’s IT capability through “data center capacity costs, which include colocation costs associated with our data centers as well as interconnectivity between data centers, depreciation related to our infrastructure hardware equipment dedicated for customer use, amortization of intangible assets, expenses associated with software, public cloud service costs, IT services and dedicated customer support, personnel‐related costs directly associated with data center operations and customer support, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock‐based compensation and allocated overhead,” while research and development expenses likewise include “data center capacity costs, costs associated with outside services contracted for research and development purposes and depreciation of infrastructure hardware equipment that is used solely for research and development purposes” to advance the platform’s functionality. In its liquidity and capital resources section, ServiceNow further discloses that cash outflows support the development of “new services and core technologies that further enhance the Now Platform, engage our customer and enhance their experience, and enable and transform our business operations,” that capital expenditures are used to expand data centers and enable the workforce, and that the company acquires technology and businesses “to supplement our technology portfolio,” illustrating the firm’s ability to mobilize and deploy IT resources in combination with other assets to support strategic objectives.

Qualcomm develops and commercializes foundational technologies and products used in mobile devices and other wireless products and derives revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing our intellectual property; substantially all of our engineering and research and development functions are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., and research and development expenses increased $856 million in fiscal 2022 driven by higher costs related to the development of wireless and integrated circuit technologies (including 5G and application processor technologies). We estimate and recognize sales-based royalties in the period in which licenseesâ€™ sales occur based largely on preliminary royalty estimates provided by our licensees, and we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes as facts giving rise to revisions become known. Managing our supply chain and operations requires advanced payments of $2.3 billion to suppliers of our integrated circuit products under multi-year capacity commitments and monitoring purchase obligations primarily related to these capacity commitments, while working capital management reflects an increase in accounts receivable due to higher revenues and the timing of integrated circuit shipments and inventory measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Our capital allocation decisions encompass $8.2 billion of research and development expenditures, $2.3 billion of cash outflows for capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions including the $4.7 billion Veoneer transaction, and return of capital to stockholders through share repurchases under our stock repurchase program and dividends paid, reflecting coordinated deployment of information, technology and financial resources in support of ongoing innovation, operational flexibility, regulatory compliance and strategic resource allocation.

PepsiCo’s enterprise risk management framework explicitly addresses information technology resilience and digital capability development, with the full board maintaining direct oversight of cybersecurity matters and receiving regular updates from senior technology leaders, including the global chief information officer and chief information security officer, on emerging threats, governance processes and initiatives to strengthen corporate risk mitigation; this framework is supported by a dedicated risk management office that provides ongoing guidance, tools and analytical support to cross-functional risk committees and to the disclosure committee, which in turn evaluates IT-related risks as part of its review of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures. In the context of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, PepsiCo notes an increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to its information systems and continues to monitor external threat landscapes and evolving geopolitical factors that could affect connectivity, data security and operational efficiency. Given the rapid evolution of the retail landscape, including the acceleration of e-commerce, online-to-offline integration and mobile commerce, PepsiCo is actively seeking to build its global e-commerce and digital capabilities—such as expanding direct-to-consumer channels and enhancing digital operations—to support changing consumer behaviors, improve market responsiveness and leverage IT-based resources in conjunction with its broader value chain.

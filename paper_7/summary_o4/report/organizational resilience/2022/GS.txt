The objectives and effectiveness of our business continuity planning (BCP), information security program, risk management and liquidity policies are highlighted as critical to operational resilience. One of our risk management disciplines is our ability to manage the size and composition of our balance sheet and we prepare a balance sheet plan that combines our projected total assets and composition of assets with our expected funding sources over a three-year time horizon. We have processes in place to dynamically manage our assets and liabilities, which include (i) balance sheet planning, (ii) balance sheet limits, (iii) monitoring of key metrics, and (iv) scenario analyses. These scenario analyses cover short- and long-term time horizons using various macroeconomic and firm-specific assumptions, including a modeled liquidity outflow based on combinations of market-wide and firm-specific stress, an intraday liquidity model, long-term stress testing to take a forward view through prolonged stress periods, and resolution liquidity models to estimate needs for winding down under our preferred resolution strategy. We maintain a contingency funding plan to provide a framework for analyzing and responding to a liquidity crisis situation or periods of market stress; our contingency funding plan outlines a list of potential risk factors, key reports and metrics that are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assist in assessing the severity of, and managing through, a liquidity crisis and/or market dislocation and identifies actions for pre-funding, coordination, liquidity maintenance activities and communication. Governance of capital resilience is supported through a comprehensive capital planning and stress-testing process, including the capital conservation buffer, stress capital buffer, countercyclical buffer and G-SIB surcharge; we determine the appropriate amount and composition of our capital by considering multiple factors, including our current and future regulatory capital requirements, the results of our capital planning and stress-testing process, the results of resolution capital models and other factors, and we maintain a contingency capital plan for potential capital deficiencies. Market risk is measured and managed through value-at-risk, earnings-at-risk and other stress tests, supplemented by sensitivity analyses such as 10 percent price shocks and credit-spread sensitivities, while credit risk is controlled through annual counterparty credit evaluations, industry and country limits, collateral, netting and credit hedges. Operational resilience is reinforced by an operational risk and control self-assessment process for identification and rating of forward-looking risks and controls; a resilience framework with regular testing of response and recovery strategies; an information and cybersecurity risk program to maintain confidentiality, integrity and availability; and a third-party risk program encompassing due diligence across risk domains. These governance, planning, monitoring and testing mechanisms, together with dynamic capabilities for adaptation under internal or external disturbances, reflect our systemic perspective and support organizational resilience.

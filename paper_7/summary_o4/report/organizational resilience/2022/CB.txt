In our Form 10-K, we explain that product and geographic diversification differentiate us from competitors and has been a source of stability during periods of industry volatility, reflecting a systemic approach to business continuity and performance under pressure. We maintain substantial cash balances, highly liquid investments, credit facilities, and reinsurance protection to provide sufficient liquidity to meet unforeseen claim demands and absorb strain in exceptional conditions. We operate under a profit‐center structure that facilitates decentralized decision‐making and resource allocation, granting senior management autonomy within underwriting authorities to develop coverages tailored to customer needs, thereby enhancing operational flexibility. Our resilience strategies include active risk assessment through catastrophe modeling across multiple return-period scenarios, qualitative and quantitative analyses for structured products subject to peer review by a dedicated global transaction committee, and remeasurement of long-duration liabilities under LDTI guidance. We continuously adjust reserve and loss-development assumptions to reflect emerging trends—such as inflation, climate change, and pandemic impacts—ensuring partial maintenance of integrity and performance. Strategic initiatives, including the acquisition and integration of Cigna’s Asia business and incremental interests in Huatai Group, strengthen our global capabilities and future orientation. Through these integrated mechanisms—spanning risk mitigation, adaptive accounting, proactive stress testing, and dynamic resource deployment—we seek to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

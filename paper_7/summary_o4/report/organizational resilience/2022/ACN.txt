Accenture combines its strength in technology with industry experience, functional expertise and global delivery capability to help clients build their digital core, optimize operations, accelerate revenue growth and enhance citizen services. During fiscal 2022, client demand for digital transformation services remained very strong, including moving to the cloud, embedding security across the enterprise and adopting new technologies, as well as application modernization and maintenance, cloud enablement and managed security services. Clients continued to focus on transforming operations through data and analytics, automation and artificial intelligence to drive productivity and operational cost savings. Cost of services reflects investment in IT-based resources such as software development, contract delivery, recruiting, training and the integration of acquisitions, while general and administrative costs include information systems supporting the firm’s ongoing technology infrastructure and capability. Commitments of $2.8 billion principally relate to cloud hosting arrangements, software subscriptions, information technology services and other obligations that underscore the firm’s mobilization and deployment of IT resources in support of its business strategies and work processes.

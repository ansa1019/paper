Our business model relies fundamentally on the development, deployment, maintenance, and continuous enhancement of our online platforms and related information technology infrastructure to support our global travel reservation services and long-term strategic objectives.  We connect consumers and travel service providers through intuitive, easy-to-use online platforms that we continuously refine to deliver a best-in-class user experience, and we are extending these platforms into a “connected trip” model that integrates multiple travel elements into a seamless, tailored, and flexible offering.  As part of this strategy, booking.com has increasingly adopted a merchant-based transaction processing architecture, enabling us to facilitate secure and flexible payment options and to handle payment processing, chargebacks, fraud prevention, and related compliance activities internally.  To support these capabilities, our information technology expenses encompass software license and system maintenance fees, cloud computing and outsourced data center costs, data communications, and contractor services for software development, system integration, and operational support.  Over the long term, we intend to continue investing in technology and personnel within parameters consistent with our growth and profitability objectives, even where such investments may temporarily compress margins.  Our investment and expense patterns reflect the competitive market for technology talent, the need to upgrade and scale our IT resources and architecture, the importance of robust data management, security, reliability, and connectivity, and the objective of mobilizing and integrating IT-based resources with other organizational capabilities to drive innovation, operational efficiency, market responsiveness, and sustainable competitive advantage.

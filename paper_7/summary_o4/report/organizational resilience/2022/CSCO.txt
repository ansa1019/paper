In fiscal 2022, we delivered growth in total revenue and strong profitability in a challenging environment impacted by significant supply constraints, rising component and related costs, and the Russia and Ukraine war; we remain focused on delivering innovation across our technologies to assist our customers in executing their digital transformations and continue to operate in a challenging macroeconomic and highly competitive environment. We have, and continue to take, multiple steps in order to mitigate the component shortages and deliver products to our customers, including partnering with several of our key suppliers utilizing our volume purchasing ability and extending supply coverage, paying significantly higher component and logistics costs to secure supply, modifying our product designs in order to leverage alternate suppliers, and continually optimizing our inventory build and customer delivery plans; as a result, we have increased our inventory balances, inventory purchase commitments, and inventory deposits and prepayments, while regularly evaluating our exposure for inventory write-downs and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments. We continued to make progress in the transition of our business model delivering increased software and subscriptions, and, while the overall environment remains uncertain, we continue to aggressively invest in priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term. In March 2022, in connection with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we announced our intention to stop business operations in Russia and Belarus for the foreseeable future and, on June 23, 2022, to begin an orderly wind-down and exit of those operations, which represented approximately 1% of our total revenue for the prior year; as a result, we have reserved for the non-recoverability of substantially all of our assets in Russia and Belarus. We continue to manage through significant supply constraints seen industry-wide due to component shortages caused, in part, by the COVID-19 pandemic, and for which the duration is uncertain, recognizing that these shortages have resulted in increased costs and extended lead times, and we believe our strategic and operational actions are helping to optimize our access to critical components and meet customer demand for our products, thereby preserving our functioning and performance despite the presence of adversity.

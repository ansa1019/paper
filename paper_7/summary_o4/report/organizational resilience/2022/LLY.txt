The Company’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis discloses a suite of risk-mitigation and resource-allocation measures that collectively support its ability to absorb strain and maintain performance under internal and external disturbances.  It emphasizes that it “manages research and development spending across our portfolio of potential new medicines” so that “a delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending,” and it undertook large-scale manufacturing of COVID-19 antibodies at risk “in order to ensure rapid access to patients around the world.”  The Company has implemented compensatory actions to improve employee retention and address wage inflation, has committed multibillion-dollar capital expenditures to expand internal and contracted manufacturing capacity worldwide, and continuously evaluates its cash, investments, and unused committed bank credit facilities to ensure sufficient liquidity and operational continuity.  It maintains a formal risk-management program, including interest rate and foreign currency hedging under defined minimum and maximum coverage parameters, and regularly performs sensitivity analyses demonstrating that hypothetical fluctuations would not materially impact earnings or cash flows.  The Company monitors environmental and regulatory developments, including legislative and reimbursement changes, creditworthiness of its customers and suppliers, and economic or geopolitical disruptions, and adjusts its business development activities—acquisitions, collaborations, licensing, and milestone and royalty arrangements—to strengthen its pipeline and preserve flexibility to reconfigure or terminate projects.  It periodically reviews long-lived and indefinite-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur, applies complex judgments in estimating fair values and impairment triggers, and engages external experts as needed.  It also evaluates retirement benefit assumptions and fair values of alternative assets with adjustments for currency, credit, liquidity, and other risks.  Through these systemic practices—ranging from dynamic capital deployment to structured contingent payments, hedging, capacity expansion, and asset-impairment monitoring—the Company positions itself to respond and adapt to disruptions, preserve integrity of operations, and emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

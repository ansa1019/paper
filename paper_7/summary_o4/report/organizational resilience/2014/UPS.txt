In response to uneven global economic growth, shifting trade patterns and overcapacity in certain trade lanes, the company adjusted its air capacity and cost structure to better match prevailing volume-mix levels, continuously reconfigured its air and ground networks and leveraged new or expanded operating facilities to improve time-in-transit, and maintained overall functioning under challenging conditions by deploying additional staffing, equipment rentals and an extra operating day during peak seasons and adverse weather. Its broad portfolio of product offerings and the inherent flexibilities of its transportation network have enabled it to adapt to changing trends, while an array of initiatives—improving flexibility and capacity in the delivery network, enhancing yield management, increasing operational efficiency and containing costs—has supported positive adjustment under pressure. The accelerated deployment of technology improvements, including facility automation and an on-road integrated optimization and navigation system, is designed to increase network capacity, flexibility and reliability. Capital commitments for vehicles, equipment and real estate provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth, and collective bargaining settlements that transfer retiree health benefit obligations to multiemployer funds have reduced balance-sheet volatility, secured fixed contribution rates and mitigated long-term liabilities, thereby preserving continuity of benefits, controlling cost variability and enhancing the company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve performance in the face of adversity.

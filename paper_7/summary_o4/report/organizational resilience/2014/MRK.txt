In 2014 Merck continued to execute its multi‐year initiative to sharpen its commercial and research and development focus, redesign its operating model and reduce its cost base while remaining focused on innovation, executing an intensified portfolio assessment process that included divesting non‐core activities such as its consumer care business, its active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing business and certain marketing rights, and redeploying capital and organizational resources to core growth drivers including animal health, vaccines and specialty pharmaceuticals. Through the 2013 restructuring program and remaining merger restructuring actions, which encompassed headcount reductions, facility rationalizations, global real estate footprint reductions and supply‐network consolidation, the company remains on track to achieve substantial annual net cost savings by the end of 2015, thereby enhancing operational flexibility and business continuity under evolving industry regulation and cost‐containment pressures. In response to intensified generic and biosimilar competition, patent expiries and government‐mandated pricing actions worldwide, Merck continually evaluates, adapts and improves its business practices to better meet customer needs and preserve performance under pressure. Supporting this systemic perspective, the company maintains a conservative financial profile and a comprehensive risk‐management framework—including revenue hedging, balance‐sheet risk management, net‐investment hedges, interest‐rate swaps and high–credit‐quality investment guidelines—to mitigate currency and interest‐rate volatility, protect cash flows and preserve balance‐sheet integrity. Merck’s ongoing strategic initiatives to acquire and in-license promising pipeline candidates (such as Idenix’s hepatitis C portfolio and OncoEthix’s MK-8628), form external collaborations (for example with Bayer on soluble guanylate cyclase modulators and with NGM on novel biologics) and out-license non-core assets reflect dynamic resource reconfiguration and future orientation designed to absorb external disruptions, sustain research productivity, maintain integrity and performance under challenging conditions, and thereby strengthen the organization’s resilience and competitive advantage.

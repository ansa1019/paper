Management continuously monitors global macroeconomic conditions and assesses opportunities for improved operational effectiveness, efficiency and alignment of expenses with revenues, resulting in a series of restructuring actions since 2008—including severance and fringe benefit provisions for manufacturing, engineering and SG&A employees, lease obligation costs and asset impairments—which have yielded estimated annual cost savings increasing from $12 million in fiscal 2012 to approximately $46.2 million when fully implemented in fiscal 2014, and which the company expects to redeploy to make additional investments in products to drive future revenue growth. During fiscal 2014, gross margin percentage decreased by 40 basis points primarily due to approximately $53.6 million of acquired inventory written up to fair value, partially offset by improved utilization levels in manufacturing facilities and a mix shift toward higher-margin products resulting from the acquisition of Hittite Microwave Corporation on July 22, 2014, which was financed through existing cash and a 90-day, $2.0 billion term loan facility (repaid in full on August 29, 2014) and resulted in the recognition of $1.4 billion of goodwill, $666.4 million of identifiable intangible assets and $41.2 million of transaction costs expensed in SMG&A and non-operating expenses. Research and development expenses increased by 9 percent in fiscal 2014, reflecting higher variable compensation linked to overall profitability, increased R&D employee and benefit expenses, other operational spending and approximately $15.0 million related to the Hittite acquisition, as the company continues “hundreds of R&D projects” it views as critical to maintaining product leadership and delivering innovative new offerings. SG&A expenses rose 15 percent year-over-year primarily due to acquisition-related transaction costs of approximately $33.3 million, higher variable compensation and headcount attributable to the acquisition, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense following a $6.3 million charge in fiscal 2013 related to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock units. Operating income remained essentially flat at $752.5 million, as a $231.1 million increase in revenue was offset by the margin compression, a $46.7 million increase in R&D expense, a $58.4 million increase in SG&A expense, a $25.8 million increase in amortization of intangible assets and a $7.5 million increase in special charges. In non-operating activities, interest expense increased due to fees and interest on the 90-day term loan, and the year-over-year decline in other income reflected the absence of the $85.4 million gain from the October 31, 2013 sale of the microphone product line, which earned net cash proceeds of $100.0 million and for which the company continues to provide transition services. The effective tax rate decreased to 13.7 percent in fiscal 2014 from 17.4 percent in fiscal 2013, reflecting a benefit of approximately $179.3 million attributable to income earned and taxed at rates below the U.S. statutory rate, primarily in Bermuda and Ireland, and the absence of discrete items recorded in the prior year. Cash provided by operations totaled $871.6 million, and as of November 1, 2014, the company held $2.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments—approximately $856.5 million of which was held in the United States and the remainder indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.—together with a $500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility, under which it remains in compliance with covenants, providing liquidity for operations, capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases. During fiscal 2014 the company repurchased 7.2 million shares for $356.3 million under its $5.6 billion authorized repurchase program, leaving $748.2 million available, declared a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share, and expects capital expenditures of $150 million to $165 million in fiscal 2015. Accounts receivable and inventory increased due to the Hittite acquisition and higher production to support anticipated demand; days sales outstanding remained stable while days cost of sales in inventory normalized following the write-up of acquired inventory. Deferred revenue on distributor shipments increased due to higher demand and channel mix shifts, and current liabilities rose on higher accruals for salaries, benefits and severance. Contractual obligations as of November 1, 2014 included $52.3 million of operating leases, $875.0 million of long-term debt obligations, $146.3 million of associated interest payments, $21.4 million of deferred compensation liabilities and $15.8 million of anticipated pension plan funding, all of which the company continues to manage in accordance with its risk-mitigation and operational flexibility objectives.

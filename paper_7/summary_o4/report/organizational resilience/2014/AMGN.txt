Amgen initiated a comprehensive restructuring plan in the second half of 2014 to reduce its staff headcount and facilities footprint by approximately 23% by the end of 2015, thereby improving its cost structure while preserving the ability to invest in continuing innovation and the launch of new pipeline molecules; concurrently, the company advanced key initiatives to streamline processes, increase organizational agility and efficiency and optimize R&D productivity through improved contracting and sourcing, rationalization of discretionary spending and expanded shared services, and completed construction and licensure initiation of a next-generation biomanufacturing facility in Singapore designed to enhance productivity at lower capital and operating costs; these actions, together with continued focus on cost efficiencies across all areas of the business, will enable Amgen to reallocate resources to fund near- and long-term growth opportunities and deliver value to patients and shareholders.  To manage external pressures and preserve business continuity amid global economic and competitive challenges, the company maintains diversified liquidity and risk-mitigation strategies—including $27.0 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, a $2.5 billion commercial paper program, a $2.5 billion syndicated revolving credit facility and designated hedges for foreign currency and interest rate exposures—and ensures compliance with debt covenants to support working capital, capital expenditure, debt service requirements, dividends, share repurchases and strategic transactions such as acquisitions and licensing.  Amgen continues to monitor payment practices of government-supported healthcare providers, adapting collection strategies as necessary, and emphasizes that its long-term success depends on the ability to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products, collaborate with external partners, devote significant resources to R&D and maintain strategic agility and operational flexibility in the face of regulatory uncertainties, product lifecycle risks, market volatility and evolving healthcare cost-containment initiatives.

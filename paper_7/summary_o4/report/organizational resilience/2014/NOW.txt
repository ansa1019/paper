In our Management’s Discussion and Analysis we acknowledge forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and direct readers to the “Risk Factors” section for discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially, reflecting our attention to risk mitigation and resilience under external pressures. We continue to invest in the development of our services, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth and maintain operational flexibility, and we leverage investments in our existing data center infrastructure to improve subscription gross profit percentage while expanding capacity and co-location facilities under operating leases for data centers. We assess the impact of future acquisitions on cost structures, noting that “to the extent future acquisitions are consummated, our cost of subscription revenues may increase due to additional non-cash charges associated with the amortization of intangible assets acquired,” demonstrating adaptive planning. We expect key expense categories including cost of subscription revenues, sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollar terms but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenues as we continue to expand our direct sales force, enhance our core platform, improve functionality, grow international operations and support growth in headcount and litigation, underpinning our resilience strategies through resource allocation and strategic foresight. We recognize the inherent uncertainty of stock-based compensation driven by fluctuations in our stock price and the performance-based vesting of RSUs and anticipate GAAP losses due to non-cash charges associated with equity awards and business combinations, highlighting our proactive measures in financial reporting. Foreign currency exposure arising from our expanding international operations is acknowledged as an ongoing risk and we are evaluating hedging programs for selected significant transactions. We describe seasonality in customer agreement signings and note that historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, emphasizing our awareness of variability and cyclical demand. Our principal sources of liquidity—cash, cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations—totaling $668.8 million in cash and equivalents and $266.8 million in long-term investments at December 31, 2014, are anticipated to be sufficient to meet liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months, including expansion of data centers, lease obligations, headcount growth and capital expenditures, while retaining the option to seek additional equity or debt financing to support business continuity and strategic adaptation. We disclose contractual obligations for operating leases under data center capacity and office space, illustrating our commitment to resource deployment, and we describe changes in net cash from operating, investing and financing activities—driven by increased sales, deferred revenue, changes in working capital, acquisition of Neebula, issuance of convertible senior notes and issuance of equity—as evidence of our capacity to absorb financial strain and preserve functioning under internal and external variations.

During fiscal 2014, the company demonstrated its capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adverse conditions through a coordinated incident response to a major payment data breach and a suite of strategic and operational initiatives.  Upon discovering that custom‐built malware had compromised payment card data for up to 56 million customers, the company eliminated the malware, supported law enforcement efforts to identify responsible parties, and recorded $63 million of pretax expenses for breach investigation, identity protection services, increased call‐center staffing and professional services, partially offset by $30 million of expected insurance proceeds under its $100 million network security and privacy liability insurance policy.  In September 2014 the company completed a major payment security project providing enhanced encryption of payment card data at the point of sale in all U.S. stores, extended enhanced encryption to Canadian stores and rolled out EMV chip-and-pin technology, thereby reconfiguring its systems to maintain integrity and customer trust under internal and external pressures.  The ongoing evaluation of potential claims by payment card networks, customer and shareholder actions and governmental investigations reflects a proactive risk assessment process and the readiness to record additional liabilities if losses become probable and estimable.  Concurrently, the company advanced its resilience capabilities through customer service simplification—rolling out a second-generation handheld mobile service tool with integrated mobile checkout and internet access to convert online sales in-aisle—through product authority enhancements via merchandising transformation and assortment planning tools to align assortments with local preferences, through disciplined capital allocation and productivity improvements in stores and supply chain, including repurchasing 80 million shares for $7 billion, authorizing an $18 billion share repurchase program, increasing the quarterly dividend by 26 percent and acquiring HD Supply Hardware Solutions to further strengthen supply chain and product offerings, and through expansion of its interconnected retail platform—enhancing website and mobile experiences to drive online sales conversion, ramping up buy-online-pick-up-in-store, buy-online-ship-to-store and piloting buy-online-deliver-from-store programs supported by new automated direct fulfillment centers to balance cost efficiency and speed.  The organization generated $8.2 billion of cash flow from operations, maintained access to $2 billion in commercial paper backed by a revolving credit facility, prudently managed its debt portfolio with senior note issuances and interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk, and financed real estate networks through capital and operating leases, while critical accounting policies for revenue recognition, inventory valuation, self-insurance and impairment assessments provide structured decision frameworks that support positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

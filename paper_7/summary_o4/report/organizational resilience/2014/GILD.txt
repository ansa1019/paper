Gilead notes that it “continues to add to our existing portfolio of products through our internal discovery and clinical development programs and through a product acquisition and in-licensing strategy,” reflecting its capacity to reconfigure resources and absorb strain under changing conditions. Its U.S. and international commercial sales operations, including marketing subsidiaries and royalty-paying collaborative agreements, exemplify inter-organizational collaboration to preserve continuity. Management reports that during 2014 it “continued to advance our product pipeline…with the goal of delivering best-in-class drugs that advance the current standard of care and/or address unmet medical needs,” demonstrating forward orientation, adaptability and systemic foresight. For 2015, Gilead states it “will continue to focus on our key operating objectives…from a research and development perspective…invest in conducting new and ongoing clinical studies…plan to file marketing applications,” and from a commercial perspective “prepare for the launch…build-out and expand our international commercial infrastructure,” evidencing resource deployment, operational flexibility and future planning. Though noting that growth is “subject to a number of uncertainties” such as macroeconomic volatility, pricing measures, foreign currency fluctuations and regulatory approvals, Gilead affirms that “our product pipeline investments and expanding commercial infrastructure will enable us to execute on our 2015 operating objectives,” capturing its resilience in maintaining performance under pressure. The company acknowledges exposure to adverse currency movements and states that “we used foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a percentage of our foreign currency exposure,” illustrating risk mitigation, and monitors inventory to anticipate demand shifts: “inventory could draw down in the first quarter of 2015 and then track more normally with demand through the rest of 2015,” reflecting strategic resource smoothing. In research and development, Gilead explains that “we manage our R&D expenses by identifying the R&D activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts…we continually review our R&D pipeline and…the status of development and, as necessary, reallocate resources…to best support the future growth of our business,” underscoring its dynamic capability, adaptive resource reconfiguration and knowledge management. Its liquidity outlook is framed by “we believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by our cash flows generated from operating activities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future,” indicating business continuity under internal and external disturbances. Gilead further details that “future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including…the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities…the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products…the establishment of additional collaborative relationships…and costs associated with…the defense…of litigation and government investigations,” reflecting comprehensive risk assessment, contingency planning and organizational governance to maintain system integrity and performance under varied pressures.

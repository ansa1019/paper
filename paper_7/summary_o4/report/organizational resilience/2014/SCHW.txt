In its MD&A, the company describes an enterprise risk management framework and committee structure that identifies and assesses credit, market, operational, compliance, and legal risks, establishes risk appetite and limits, and monitors exposures and collateral arrangements to maintain system integrity and performance under internal and external disturbances. Management emphasizes the maintenance of diversified liquidity and funding sources—including brokerage client cash balances, banking client deposits, commercial paper programs, committed bank facilities, and access to Federal Home Loan Bank advances and the Federal Reserve’s discount window—and the use of target leverage and capital ratios that are stress-tested through scenario modeling of systemic downturns and idiosyncratic events. Business continuity and operational flexibility are supported by dual data centers, backup and recovery testing, disaster recovery planning, vendor management controls, dynamic portfolio management that adjusts investment maturities and repricing of funding sources, and revised underwriting criteria to respond to evolving market conditions. Capital planning incorporates a capital contingency plan for low-probability, high-severity events, while credit risk is mitigated through statistical loan-level simulation models that forecast defaults, prepayments, and loss severities based on housing-price indices and borrower credit metrics. Compliance, internal audit, model governance, and fiduciary risk sub-committees reinforce regulatory adherence and guard against misconduct, external fraud, and service disruption. Collectively, these strategies and capabilities enable the firm to absorb strain, reconfigure resources, mitigate risk, recover from adversity, and sustain performance under challenging and volatile conditions.

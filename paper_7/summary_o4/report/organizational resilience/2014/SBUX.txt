Throughout fiscal 2014, Starbucks demonstrated the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions by absorbing the $2.8 billion Kraft litigation charge while expanding consolidated operating margin to 18.7 percent through sales leverage and lower commodity costs, and by funding that payment from operating cash flows of $607.8 million that were partially offset by the arbitration outlay but bolstered by strong earnings and favorable changes in working capital accounts, thereby preserving business continuity. The continued strength of the global business model and the ability to successfully execute new growth initiatives in a disciplined manner were reflected in net new store openings across all segments, product innovation, expansion of beverage platforms, elevated food programs and disciplined licensed‐store growth in EMEA, each requiring adaptive resource deployment, operational flexibility and systemic coordination. In the China/Asia Pacific segment, strong performance of new company‐operated and licensed stores, together with improved equity‐investee results, illustrates the capacity to absorb strain and maintain functioning under rapid market expansion, while the Channel Development segment’s 11 percent revenue growth driven by premium single‐serve products exemplifies diversification of customer occasions outside retail stores for competitive advantage. Looking ahead to fiscal 2015, management expects 16 to 18 percent revenue growth—supported by mid-single-digit comparable store sales, approximately 1,650 net new stores and a $325 million to $375 million acquisition-related gain—along with approximately $1.4 billion of capital expenditures for new stores, renovations and investments to support ongoing growth initiatives, all financed through $2.2 billion of cash and investments, an unsecured $750 million revolving credit facility maturing in 2018, a $1 billion commercial paper program and internally generated cash flows. Starbucks’ market price risk management policy, which employs fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed green‐coffee contracts, commodity and currency derivatives with no maturities beyond three years and strict counterparty limits, combined with evaluation of long‐lived assets for impairment based on discounted cash flows and fair‐value estimates, and disciplined treatment of deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits, underpins its ability to absorb environmental perturbations, mitigate risk, preserve system integrity and reconfigure operations for sustained performance under pressure.

During fiscal 2012–2014, Adobe completed business acquisitions—of Neolane, Behance and Efficient Frontier—and integrated these businesses into its digital marketing and digital media segments, reconstituting organizational resources to preserve or improve functioning under adversity. Management bases its assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various factors believed reasonable under the circumstances, regularly evaluates and discusses them with the audit committee, and acknowledges that actual results could differ materially under different conditions, thereby embedding risk assessment and mitigation into its decision-making. The transformation of its business model toward recurring, ratable subscription and term-based licensing, supported by targeted strategies to accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of Creative Cloud and Adobe Marketing Cloud offerings, has driven higher long-term revenue growth, increased predictability and operational flexibility, and diversified revenue streams. Substantial investments in data center infrastructure, network operations and research and development—including recruiting and hiring of software developers—along with a disciplined approach to multiple-element revenue arrangements, deferred and unbilled revenue management, and reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures, further strengthen the company’s capacity to absorb strain and maintain performance under internal or external variations. Financial resilience is reinforced by a five-year $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, interest rate hedges on long-term debt, professional investment management of cash and marketable securities, and structured stock repurchase agreements under a $2.0 billion authorization. In parallel, the company has undertaken restructuring initiatives—accruing and paying termination benefits and closing redundant facilities—while asserting that its existing cash, cash equivalents, investment balances and anticipated operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet working capital, operating resource expenditures and strategic commitments over the ensuing twelve months.

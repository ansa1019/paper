In 2014, we significantly increased our sales and service footprint worldwide, entered new markets including China, and accelerated the rollout of our supercharging network, reflecting organizational flexibility and resource allocation to support business continuity under expanding geographic and market conditions; our ability to launch the Model X program on time and cost-efficiently depended on completion of production tooling, supplier readiness, engineering completion and successful validation testing, highlighting our risk mitigation processes, cross-functional collaboration and adaptation to disruptive events; we executed a plan to increase combined Model S and Model X production capacity to over 2,000 units per week by the end of 2015 and invested in new paint and body shops, demonstrating operational agility and future orientation in the face of production scale challenges; we continued to lower manufacturing costs and improve gross margin through supply chain efficiencies and component cost reductions, while managing one-time manufacturing inefficiencies during assembly line transitions, illustrating our ability to absorb strain and preserve performance amid internal variations; despite initial challenges in China and relatively limited experience in certain markets, we plan continued investment in our infrastructure there, reflecting resilience strategies and resource generation to confront external pressures; to support growth, we anticipated approximately $1.5 billion of capital expenditures to expand production capacity, complete Model X development, invest in the Gigafactory, stores, service centers and supercharger network, underpinned by liquidity management processes to maintain operational continuity; our development of the Gigafactory—partnering with experienced cell producers—constitutes inter-organizational collaboration aimed at securing critical supply chain resilience, although costs and timelines remain subject to uncertainty; we maintain rigorous working capital discipline through inventory valuation forecasts and quarterly warranty reserve reviews and recognize the risk of unexpected warranty costs and lease-end customer returns under our resale value guarantee program, underscoring our cross-functional risk assessment and resource reconfiguration mechanisms; and we believe current liquidity sources—including cash and equivalents, customer deposits, regulatory credit sales and powertrain component revenues—will provide adequate financial resources to absorb adverse conditions and sustain our strategic initiatives over the next 12 months.

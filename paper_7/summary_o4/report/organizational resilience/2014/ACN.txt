Accenture discloses that it continuously monitors economic volatility, geopolitical uncertainty and client spending patterns and “seeks to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions,” adjusting pricing, the mix of resources and workforce composition to preserve or improve operating performance under internal or external variations.  The company reports results “in local currency” to remove the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and uses currency protection provisions and hedging programs to manage exchange-rate exposure on revenues and costs, thereby facilitating more reliable period-to-period comparisons of business performance.  To absorb strain and maintain operational flexibility, Accenture “proactively plan[s] and manage[s] the size and composition of our workforce,” hiring to meet current and projected demand, deploying lower-cost resources in its global delivery network, adjusting compensation in key skill sets and geographies to attract and retain talent, and using involuntary terminations when necessary to balance supply and demand.  Contract management practices include rigorous pre-award reviews to evaluate incentive achievability, continuous reassessment of contract profitability estimates under time-and-materials, fixed-price and cost-plus models, recognition of revenue only when performance obligations are met and contingencies are resolved, deferral and straight-line amortization of transition costs for outsourcing set-up activities, and recording loss provisions whenever estimated total costs exceed anticipated revenues or projected undiscounted cash flows do not support the carrying amount of contract assets.  Accenture’s approach to liquidity and resilience includes maintaining significant cash reserves and $1.7 billion of committed and uncommitted credit facilities, governing contractual obligations for future payments under leases, purchase commitments and debt, and using discretionary cash allocations for share repurchases, dividends or acquisitions, all of which enable the reconfiguration of resources, adaptation to disruptive change and preservation of system integrity and performance under challenging conditions.

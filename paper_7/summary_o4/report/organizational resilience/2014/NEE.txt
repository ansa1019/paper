During 2014, NEE and its subsidiaries implemented initiatives determined during a 2013 enterprise-wide process focused on improving productivity and reducing O&M expenses, including transition costs associated with a cost savings initiative recorded by NEE of approximately $72 million; FPL placed in service the 1,212 MW combined-cycle Riviera Beach plant, commenced the Port Everglades modernization project and obtained FPSC approval to invest in long-term Woodford Shale gas supplies with recovery through the fuel clause, while FPL plans further transmission and distribution infrastructure enhancements, three solar PV projects by the end of 2016 and additional gas supply investments, and NEER is targeting an additional 980 MW of U.S. wind, 175 MW of Canadian wind and 960 MW of solar capacity during 2015â€“2016 and pursuing further investment opportunities. NEE and its subsidiaries maintain liquidity supported by approximately $7.0 billion of net available credit facilities, cash flows from operations, short- and long-term borrowings, equity issuances and proceeds from membership interest sales to finance working capital, capital expenditures, asset acquisitions and maturities of debt, consistent with a capital structure designed to support a strong investment-grade credit rating and ensure operational continuity. To mitigate commodity price, interest rate and foreign currency risks inherent in fuel and electricity transactions and debt issuances, NEE and FPL employ derivative instruments, hedging strategies and master netting agreements, and apply regulatory accounting for base rates, cost recovery clauses, asset retirement obligations and fuel-clause deferrals, enabling the preservation of functionality and performance while under internal or external variations and disturbances, including the capacity to absorb up to $122 million of storm restoration costs without recourse to rate adjustments.

Bristol-Myers Squibb describes how “we continue to evolve our business to a leading diversified specialty biopharma company,” noting that “the evolution was accelerated as a result of the diabetes business divestiture” and that it “continually evaluates our portfolio to ensure that there is an appropriate balance of early-stage and late-stage programs to support future growth,” reflecting adaptive strategic initiatives and resource reconfiguration under external pressures. The company highlights its “expanding our biologics manufacturing capacity at Devens, Massachusetts and announced plans to build a new facility in Ireland” as measures to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite market challenges. Financial resilience is underscored by disciplined working-capital management—focusing on receivables, inventories and payables—an investment policy limiting exposure to high-credit-quality institutions, maintenance of investment-grade credit ratings and two $1.5 billion revolving credit facilities to ensure liquidity sufficiency. To mitigate operational and compliance risks, BMS has established a company-wide policy and governance processes to “limit sales of all products … based on expected demand or on amounts that do not exceed approximately one month of inventory on hand,” re-engineered accounting and reporting processes with external consultants and continues to monitor economic conditions to maintain business continuity and performance under challenging conditions.

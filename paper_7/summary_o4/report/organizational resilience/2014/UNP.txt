In 2014 and in its 2015 outlook, management emphasized sustaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions by focusing on safety initiatives to reduce risk and eliminate incidents, achieving record personal injury and derailment metrics through employee engagement efforts under Courage to Care, Total Safety Culture and UPWay continuous‐improvement culture, and continuing prevention and mitigation efforts for at-grade crossing improvements with new approaches to reduce exposure to crossing accidents. The company employs a multi-faceted approach to safety and operational continuity, utilizing technology, risk assessment strategies, quality control, training, targeted capital investments and expanded deployment of best practices to increase detection of rail defects, improve or close crossings and educate the public and law enforcement across its integrated rail network. In response to severe weather, volume growth and a slower network, resources were added to support growth, improve service and replenish surge capability, while core pricing gains, business demand and productivity initiatives more than offset incremental operating costs to drive the operating ratio to a record low. The 2015 capital plan of approximately $4.3 billion prioritizes renewing and improving existing track infrastructure to provide safe, fluid operations; adding or improving facilities, track and equipment—including 218 locomotives, freight cars, domestic intermodal containers, positive train control and a major classification yard—to enhance network efficiency, meet customer demand and seize long-term growth opportunities. Liquidity and capital resources are maintained through diversified funding sources—cash and cash equivalents, a $1.7 billion revolving credit facility, a $650 million receivables securitization facility, commercial paper capacity and access to bond and bank financings—while monitoring debt-to-capital coverage ratios and covenant compliance. Additionally, interest-rate and fuel-price hedge instruments and fuel surcharge programs mitigate exposure to market volatility, reflecting a systemic perspective on risk mitigation, resource deployment and preservation of performance under external and internal variations.

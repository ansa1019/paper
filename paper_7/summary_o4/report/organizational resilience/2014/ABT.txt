Abbott’s operations have demonstrated organizational resilience through its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under internal and external disturbances, as evidenced by its response to a challenging economic and fiscal environment in several emerging economies and to foreign currency fluctuations during 2013 and 2014 while still achieving sales growth and margin improvement. For example, in the second half of 2013 and the first two quarters of 2014, sales growth in international pediatric nutrition was significantly disrupted by a third-party supplier recall in China and two other markets; although no health issues arose, Abbott initiated targeted investments in the third quarter of 2013 to rebuild consumer confidence, and this business had recovered by the beginning of the third quarter of 2014. In 2014 Abbott further strengthened its operational continuity by investing in global infrastructure—opening three new manufacturing plants in China, India, and the United States—and forming a strategic alliance with Fonterra to develop a proposed dairy farm hub in China. Across its worldwide diagnostics business, Abbott executed efficiency initiatives in manufacturing and supply chain functions that raised operating margins from 19.2 percent of sales in 2012 to 22.9 percent in 2014 while achieving unit growth across geographical regions. Strategic reconfiguration of resources in the established pharmaceuticals segment included the disposition of developed-markets branded generics operations and the acquisitions of controlling interests in CFR Pharmaceuticals and Veropharm, which more than doubled Abbott’s presence in Latin America, established a manufacturing footprint in Russia, and aligned newly acquired portfolios with Abbott’s therapeutic focus. In September 2014 management approved plans to streamline operations to reduce costs and improve efficiencies across nutritional and established pharmaceuticals businesses, recording employee-related severance and accelerated-depreciation charges to reallocate resources within cost of products sold, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses. Abbott has maintained future orientation and adaptability by funding its defined benefit pension plans with $393 million in 2014 and planning approximately $585 million in funding for 2015, by managing its research and development portfolio at roughly 6–7 percent of sales annually, and by preserving financial flexibility through $5.0 billion of unused credit lines, the redemption of up to $3.0 billion in share repurchases, and consistent net cash generation from operating activities (for example, $3.7 billion in 2014 despite the AbbVie separation). The improvement in receivables collection from governmental health systems in Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Greece, the navigation of multiple regulatory frameworks outside the U.S. and EU, and the conditional reinvestment of foreign earnings further illustrate Abbott’s ability to adjust positively under pressure and maintain continuity and performance across its global system.

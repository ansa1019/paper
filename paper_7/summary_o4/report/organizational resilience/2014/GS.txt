Management’s Discussion and Analysis highlights that, in anticipation of and response to potential disruptions, we have implemented a comprehensive business continuity plan and information security program, supported by firm-wide risk management, liquidity and capital planning frameworks designed to preserve functioning and performance under stress.  We conduct quarterly balance sheet planning to project near-term assets, liabilities and funding needs—factoring in market conditions, business activity levels and regulatory requirements—and establish business-specific and firm-wide balance sheet and risk limits, with daily monitoring and escalation protocols to ensure prompt adjustments in response to internal or external pressures.  Our liquidity risk management includes the maintenance of global core liquid assets sufficient to meet modeled outflows over a 30-day stress period, together with an intraday liquidity model, diversified secured and unsecured funding sources, and a contingency funding plan that specifies actions for emergency and prolonged market stress, including pre-funding collateral requirements and secondary liquidity sources.  In parallel, our capital planning and stress-testing process incorporates multiple scenario analyses, including the Federal Reserve’s Dodd-Frank and CCAR stress tests and internally developed severely adverse scenarios, to project sources and uses of capital, assess resilience to adverse macroeconomic and firm-specific shocks, and guide the sizing of capital buffers and contingency plans.  Governance of these resilience strategies is formalized through senior-level committees—such as the Firmwide Business Resilience Committee, Firmwide Risk Committee and Investment Policy Committee—which oversee the development, approval and review of policies, limits and mitigation techniques, while independent control and support functions validate valuation models, verify pricing, and monitor operational risks, ensuring that the right information reaches the right decision makers in a timely manner.  Our resolution and recovery plans, required by the Federal Reserve and FDIC, further define strategies for rapid and orderly resolution or recovery should material financial distress occur, reflecting a systemic perspective on organizational strength, flexibility and continuity of critical functions even under extreme or exceptional conditions.  Collectively, these integrated governance structures, processes and systems constitute our dynamic approach to preserve positive adjustment and continuity of operations across volatile market environments, thereby embedding organizational resilience into our strategic and operational decision-making.

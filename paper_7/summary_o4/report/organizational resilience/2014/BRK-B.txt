Berkshire Hathaway emphasizes decentralized governance, with essentially no centralized sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources functions and minimal headquarters involvement in operating businesses, fostering operational flexibility and rapid local decision-making. Its insurance operations maintain extraordinary capital strength—statutory surplus of approximately $129 billion at December 31, 2014—to absorb catastrophe losses and negotiate custom reinsurance contracts that preserve continuity under extreme or exceptional conditions. Management insists on ample liquidity, holding about $42.8 billion of low-yield cash and cash equivalents to secure business continuity and mitigate resource constraints, and continuously adjusts reserves—reducing liabilities for prior years’ losses or increasing estimates for asbestos and environmental claims—to reflect evolving risk assessments and preserve financial integrity. The railroad business responded to severe winter weather and service disruptions by investing in line expansions, system improvements, additional equipment and new hires to restore service levels without compromising safety. Berkshire Hathaway Energy sustains its system resilience through ongoing capital expenditures—over $6.6 billion in 2014—and strategic acquisitions such as NV Energy and AltaLink, reconfiguring its generation and transmission portfolio to meet customer needs and regulatory requirements. Finance and financial products subsidiaries manage credit, liquidity and interest-rate exposures through diversified leasing, financing and floating-rate debt, ensuring continued performance under market volatility. Across its diverse operations, Berkshire’s combination of robust capital buffers, decentralized management, adaptive reserve management, targeted resource deployment and strategic capacity investments exemplifies its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning amid adversity.

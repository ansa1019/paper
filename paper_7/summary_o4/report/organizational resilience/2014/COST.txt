We believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to changes beyond our control—such as fluctuations in currency exchange rates, gasoline costs, general economic health and competitive conditions—through adjustments to our pricing strategies and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of private-label items, selectively reducing prices to drive sales or hold them steady despite cost increases and investing in modernizing our information systems to enhance operational flexibility; as our warehouse base grows, we recognize that site scarcity, higher initial operating profitability challenges and cannibalization risk must be managed to preserve overall performance, and we continue to leverage low-margin operations by disciplined cost control in areas partially outside our direct influence—most notably health care, utilities and above-average employee compensation to reduce turnover and strengthen human capital; we fund capital expenditures for new and remodeled warehouses, technology and working capital primarily with operating cash flows, existing cash and short-term investments, maintain bank credit and letter-of-credit facilities that we intend to renew prior to expiration, and defer U.S. taxes on indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings to ensure sufficient liquidity and meet foreseeable capital requirements; we apply risk mitigation practices across our system, including quarterly adjustments to merchandise inventories under LIFO or FIFO to match current costs with sales, provisions for shrinkage based on historical trends, regular impairment reviews of investments and long-lived assets, actuarially estimated self-insurance liabilities and conservative recognition of uncertain tax positions, all of which contribute to our ability to absorb strain, preserve functioning and maintain performance under internal or external disturbances.

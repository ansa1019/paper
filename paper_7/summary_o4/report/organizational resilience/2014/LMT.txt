The company operates in a global security and aerospace environment characterized by increasing complexity in global security, continuing economic pressures and constrained government budgets; in response it has focused on program execution and improving the quality, predictability and affordability of product and service delivery, extended its portfolio into adjacent markets and international sales to diversify reliance on U.S. government customers, invested in technologies, talent and R&D to fulfill new mission requirements, and pursued strategic acquisitions, divestitures and internal realignments to leverage existing capabilities. To mitigate risk arising from potential supply-chain disruptions, contract terminations, fragmentation of large contracts into smaller price-based awards, sequestration and personnel reductions, the company continuously monitors and adjusts profit-booking rates, employs performance-based payment structures, and maintains offset agreements, letters of credit and cross-indemnities to preserve business continuity. In anticipation of adverse shifts in government spending the company has undertaken facility consolidations, workforce reductions and cost-structure realignments to maintain organizational flexibility and cost discipline, and has established credit facilities, commercial paper programs and balanced cash-deployment strategies—consisting of operating cash flow generation, capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases—to ensure financial resilience and preserve liquidity. The company regularly evaluates and adjusts goodwill, environmental remediation provisions and foreign market commitments, aligning its operating segments and reporting units with evolving workloads, risk profiles and contractual obligations, thereby maintaining organizational integrity and performance despite internal or external variations and disturbances.

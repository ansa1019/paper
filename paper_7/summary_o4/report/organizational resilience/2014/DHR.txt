Danaher’s MD&A describes how its global geographic, industry and product diversity typically limits the impact of any one industry or single country on consolidated operating results, underscoring its ability to absorb strain and maintain performance under varying economic and political pressures. Management emphasizes reliance on general economic trends supplemented by ongoing monitoring of key competitors and customers to gauge relative performance and inform outlook. The company underscores that long-term growth and profitability depend on its capacity to expand in high-growth geographies and segments, identify and integrate acquisitions, innovate differentiated products, services and software, bolster sales force effectiveness, reduce costs through restructuring actions and productivity improvement initiatives, and address increasingly regulated environments. To this end, Danaher is making significant investments organically and through acquisitions to address rapid technological change and to globalize manufacturing, R&D and customer-facing resources, thereby improving operational efficiency and responsiveness. In the second half of 2014, the company initiated restructuring actions—incurring approximately $155 million of pre-tax charges—to enhance productivity, reduce costs and generate expected savings of $125 million in 2015. Segment disclosures further illustrate resilience in practice, including test & measurement offerings designed to keep customer operations up and running and safeguard networks, communications businesses increasing R&D investments to support customers’ transition to next-generation technologies, environmental businesses planning growth as customers upgrade systems to comply with enhanced security standards, and the acquisition and integration of Nobel Biocare to expand geographic and product line diversity and realize cost synergies through the Danaher Business System. The company continues to expect overall sales growth while remaining cautious about macro-economic and geopolitical uncertainties, reflecting a systemic perspective on sustaining function and performance under challenging conditions.

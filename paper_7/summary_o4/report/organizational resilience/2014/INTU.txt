Management’s discussion highlights the dynamic and highly competitive nature of the software and related services market—characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions—which underpins the Company’s strategic shift toward connected services and more frequent product releases designed to improve customer experience, accommodate operating system updates and provide access to online offerings, thereby reallocating resources from traditional one-time desktop license sales to subscription and hosted models and deferring revenue to smooth seasonal fluctuations.  The Company expects this approach to partially mitigate pronounced seasonality in its QuickBooks and tax-related revenue streams and to enhance operational continuity.  Acknowledging the critical importance of sustaining the ongoing operation and availability of its information technology and communication systems, including those of external providers, management is investing significant resources in IT infrastructure, privacy and security capabilities to mitigate risks associated with data hosting, collection, use and retention.  The liquidity and capital resources section underscores the maintenance of a strong cash, cash-equivalent and investment balance—bolstered by $1.4 billion in operating cash flow in fiscal 2014, an unused $500 million revolving credit facility, acquisitions of Check Inc. and Demandforce, share repurchase authorizations and planned headquarters capital improvements—as a means of absorbing financial strain, preserving functioning under adverse conditions and ensuring the ability to deploy resources for growth.  Detailed disclosures on legal contingencies, revenue recognition estimates and uncertain tax positions further reflect rigorous risk assessment and resource management processes intended to preserve system integrity and performance under internal and external pressures, adapt to environmental disruptions and emerge stronger from challenging situations.

KKR’s disclosures emphasize its capacity to maintain positive adjustment and operational continuity under challenging conditions by leveraging a patient and disciplined investment approach, a diversified global platform and a substantial and diversified capital base. The firm “invest[s] our own capital alongside the capital we manage for fund investors,” aligning interests and preserving functioning through economic and financial perturbations. By expanding into new areas—credit, special situations, hedge funds, collateralized loan obligations, capital markets, infrastructure, energy and real estate—and building on “core principles and industry expertise,” KKR reconfigures its resource allocation to capitalize on a broader range of opportunities and manage fragmentation. Its investment teams, supported by operating consultants, senior advisors and a worldwide network of business relationships, provide specialized knowledge during due diligence, enhancing absorptive capacity, risk assessment and adaptive strategies. With over 75% of its fee-paying assets under management not subject to redemption for at least eight years, KKR secures stable funding, “significant flexibility to grow investments and select exit opportunities” and resilience to survive, grow and flourish in turbulent markets. The firm manages liquidity and working capital needs through diversified fee streams, transaction-specific income, carried interest distributions and yield from balance sheet investments, supported by senior notes and revolving credit facilities to underwrite market disruptions and emergencies. KKR continuously monitors global economic conditions, market volatility, foreign exchange and commodity price fluctuations to inform strategic initiatives, maintain system integrity and reconstitute its trajectories of response toward disruptive events, thereby preserving its competitive advantage and emerging stronger from adversity.

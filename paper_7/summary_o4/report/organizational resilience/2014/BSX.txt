The company regularly monitors economic, industry and market dynamics and assesses opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency, seeking to better align expenses with revenues while preserving its ability to invest in research and development, capital projects, talent and other programs that drive growth, reflecting an adaptive resource-allocation approach under varying internal and external pressures. It maintains robust liquidity through strong cash flows from operations, full access to a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility and a secured receivables facility, and invests excess cash in diversified, low-risk instruments, thereby mitigating financial hazards and sustaining business continuity. The firm’s investment-grade credit profile, underpinned by a diverse product portfolio, leading market positions and solid financial fundamentals, supports strategic flexibility and rapid reconfiguration of capital when facing regulatory changes, price-containment initiatives or reimbursement uncertainties. Ongoing restructuring initiatives have yielded manufacturing cost reductions and headcount realignments designed to enhance long-term success, and the company retains significant operating cash to repurchase shares, fund acquisitions, settle contingencies and finance emerging-market expansion—all of which illustrate practices that maintain performance and preserve integrity under both nominal and challenging conditions.

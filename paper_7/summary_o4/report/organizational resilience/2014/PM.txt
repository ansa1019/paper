Philip Morris International Inc. manages its business in four segments across more than 180 markets with a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands, and its net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors, including the volume and price of its products, changes in currency exchange rates and product and geographic mix, thereby illustrating its capacity to absorb external variations and preserve performance. As a holding company, PMIâ€™s principal sources of funds for debt service and strategic initiatives are dividends and debt repayments from its subsidiaries, reflecting strategic resource allocation to maintain business continuity. In 2014, PMI recorded pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs of $535 million ($409 million after tax) primarily related to factory closures in the Netherlands, Australia and Canada and the restructuring of its U.S. leaf purchasing model, and on April 4, 2014 announced consultations with employee representatives and agreement on a social plan to discontinue production at its Bergen op Zoom factory, demonstrating organizational reconfiguration and stakeholder engagement under challenging conditions. The 2015 forecast includes incremental spending for its reduced-risk product, IQOS, to support national expansions and pilot or national launches in additional markets, reflecting future orientation and strategic adaptation to consumer needs and market disruptions. PMI defines adjusted diluted EPS as reported diluted EPS of $4.76 adjusted for asset impairment and exit costs, discrete tax items and unusual items, to provide a measure of core earnings that improves comparability and aids analysis of business performance during exceptional events. The company will revisit share repurchases as the year unfolds, depending on the currency environment, exemplifying operational flexibility and dynamic capital management in response to external pressures.

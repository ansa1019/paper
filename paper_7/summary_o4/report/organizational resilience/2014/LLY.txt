Management emphasizes that the company’s long-term success depends on its ability to discover, develop and collaborate on innovative pharmaceutical products and that R&D spending is managed across a portfolio of molecules so that delays or terminations of any single project will not materially affect overall investment levels; the company recognizes the inherent uncertainties and high failure rates in drug discovery, noting that failure can occur at any point, most research programs will not generate financial returns and precise timing, costs and revenues cannot be reliably estimated, yet it manages these risks through milestone-based collaborations, diversified pipelines and cost-containment initiatives; it has no off-balance-sheet arrangements likely to have material current or future effects and acquires and collaborates on potential products still in development under milestone and royalty arrangements, supporting inter-organizational collaboration and resource reallocation; to preserve business continuity and mitigate financial risks, management believes amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should adequately fund short-term borrowing needs, and in an effort to manage interest-rate and foreign-currency exposures it maintains a balance between fixed and floating-rate debt and uses interest-rate and currency derivatives under policy-defined hedge coverage levels to offset the impact of market fluctuations; the company further acknowledges external pressures such as currency volatility, pricing and reimbursement reforms and patent expirations and responds through asset impairments, restructuring to reduce cost structure and global workforce, accelerated expense recognition for regulatory changes and strategic transactions including the acquisition of Novartis Animal Health and related divestitures, all reflecting the organization’s capacity to absorb strain, adapt operational parameters and maintain performance under challenging conditions.

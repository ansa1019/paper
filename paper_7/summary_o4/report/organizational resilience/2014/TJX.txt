During fiscal 2015, the Company continued to generate strong cash flows, returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while reinvesting in its operations by opening new stores, remodeling existing facilities and strengthening infrastructure to support future growth. Inventory‐related hedging instruments are routinely used to mitigate earnings volatility arising from foreign currency fluctuations, with mark‐to‐market adjustments offset upon receipt and payment of inventory purchases. Management anticipates that a sustained strengthening of the U.S. dollar could exert greater negative pressure on results in fiscal 2016. The Company has proactively managed its debt portfolio through the issuance of lower-cost notes and early extinguishment of higher-cost debt, and has authorized successive share repurchase programs to optimize its capital structure and enhance diluted earnings per share. Same store sales metrics, defined by consistent reporting criteria, drive expense leverage in buying, occupancy and administrative costs, while the retail method, incorporating markdown and shrinkage estimates, ensures accurate inventory valuation. Pension obligations are periodically re‐measured using discount rate and return assumptions, with voluntary contributions made to maintain appropriate funded status. Since transition to a self-insured casualty insurance program, actuarial estimates inform accruals for claim liabilities. Reserves for uncertain tax positions, former operations and legal contingencies are maintained based on probable outcomes and reasonable estimates. Operating cash flows, bolstered by operating earnings, deferred tax provisions and working capital timing, combined with internally generated funds and credit facilities, underpin the Company’s liquidity. Planned capital expenditures of approximately $975 million in fiscal 2016 will be funded internally to support growth in offices, distribution centers, store renovations and new store openings. Financing activities reflect net proceeds from debt issuances and substantial share repurchases. Cash and cash equivalents, including balances held abroad and available credit, are deemed sufficient to meet operating requirements and contractual obligations under long-term debt, leases and purchase commitments, thereby reinforcing the Company’s ability to absorb internal and external pressures while maintaining performance.

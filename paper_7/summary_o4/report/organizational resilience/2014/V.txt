Visa regularly evaluates cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures and may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of debt or equity, with treasury policies providing management guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with its corporate objectives and to provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios, ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities, ensure payments on required litigation settlements, make planned capital investments in the business, pay dividends and repurchase shares and optimize income earned by investing excess cash in securities that enable it to meet its working capital and liquidity needs. Based on its current cash flow budgets and forecasts of short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, the company believes its projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet projected needs for more than the next 12 months and will continue to assess its liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances. Payments settlement due from and to financial institution clients are managed through settlement guarantee policies and procedures that may require clients to post collateral, and in the ordinary course of business the company enters into indemnifications with clients to limit settlement losses, while maintaining a litigation escrow account under its retrospective responsibility plan to fund covered litigation liabilities. The investment portfolio, primarily comprised of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury and government-sponsored agencies, is structured to invest excess cash in securities that enable the company to meet working capital and liquidity needs, and policies limit credit exposure to any one institution or type of investment. The effect of exchange rate movements on operating revenues is partially mitigated by its hedging program. Additionally, Visa maintains a commercial paper program, a $3.0 billion revolving unsecured credit facility and a universal shelf registration statement to support its working capital requirements, planned investments, dividends, share repurchases and other general corporate purposes, which it believes collectively will be sufficient to meet ongoing operational needs, absorb strain from internal or external variations and preserve performance and operating flexibility under challenging conditions.

The MD&A provides a narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results, embodying a systemic perspective and future-orientation to maintain performance under varying conditions. We describe our un-carrier proposition—un-satisfied with the status quo, un-afraid to innovate—which seeks to listen to customers, address their pain points, bring innovation to the industry and improve the wireless experience for all, continuously listening, responding and refining our value proposition to deliver the best experience and maintain competitive advantage. During 2014, we launched phases 4.0 through 8.0 of this strategy—including contract freedom, test drive, music freedom, wi-fi un-leashed and data stash—together with partnerships such as our agreement with Gogo and deployment of the T-Mobile Personal CellSpot to reconfigure resources rapidly, respond to disruptive customer expectations and preserve service continuity. To support resilience in our network operations, we incurred expenses for network modernization—building out a nationwide LTE network covering 265 million people, decommissioning legacy CDMA sites and targeting coverage of 300 million people by the end of 2015—and opportunistically acquired and exchanged spectrum licenses to absorb environmental perturbations and maintain system integrity. Our principal sources of liquidity—cash, cash generated from operations, long-term debt and equity issuances, a two-year $640 million factoring arrangement to sell receivables, vendor financing and an unsecured revolving credit facility—maintain organizational flexibility and resourcefulness to meet capital requirements, opportunistically acquire spectrum and support business continuity. We regularly review and update projections for changes in financial and operating results, general economic conditions, competitive landscape and other factors to ensure preparedness under unexpected situations. The indentures governing our long-term debt impose covenants that limit our ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends, make certain investments, enter into transactions with affiliates or dispose of assets; we were in compliance as of December 31, 2014, reflecting adherence to risk-mitigation mechanisms. We expect capital expenditures of $4.4 to $4.7 billion in 2015 for network infrastructure evolution, excluding further spectrum acquisitions. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $4.1 billion in 2014 from $3.5 billion in 2013, reflecting growth in operating income, improved working capital through our factoring arrangement and vendor payment extensions to preserve liquidity and operational continuity. We utilize non-GAAP measures such as Adjusted EBITDA—earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and non-reflective items—to monitor operating performance, assess our ability to fund debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements and benchmark against industry peers. Critical accounting policies—reserving for credit losses on equipment installment receivables, straight-line rent expense for leases with fixed escalations and regular impairment assessments of goodwill and spectrum licenses using discounted cash flow and Greenfield approaches—support transparent impact assessment, resource allocation and organizational intelligence in adjusting to internal and external disturbances.

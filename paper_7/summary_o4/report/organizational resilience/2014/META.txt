Management’s ongoing evaluation of estimates and assumptions, including the recognition that actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements, reflects a proactive approach to organizational resilience. We review our loss contingencies at least quarterly, adjusting provisions to reflect negotiations, settlements, rulings, and legal advice, and we reverse or recognize lease abandonment expenses—as in 2014 when we reversed $34 million upon re-occupying a previously exited data center—to reconfigure resources and preserve business continuity. Our goodwill and intangible-asset impairment processes begin with qualitative assessments to determine if carrying values exceed fair values, and, when events indicate potential impairment, we compare carrying amounts to undiscounted cash flows and write down to fair value when recoverability is not demonstrated. We anticipate that 2015 cost of revenue will increase as we expand data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user growth and new products, and we plan to bolster our engineering, sales, marketing, and administrative headcount to maintain operational flexibility. We maintain a $6.5 billion revolver, expect our funds and cash flow to satisfy foreseeable needs, and acknowledge that any contingencies resolved against us beyond our estimates could materially impact our financial condition.

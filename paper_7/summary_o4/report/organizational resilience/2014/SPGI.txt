During the period, the company pursued a strategic reconfiguration of its portfolio through selective investments in high-growth, scale markets—completing acquisitions such as Eclipse Energy and BRC Investor Services—and divesting non-core assets including McGraw Hill Construction, Aviation Week and selected real estate, while streamlining its infrastructure by reducing its real estate footprint, consolidating its corporate headquarters, disposing of corporate aircraft and exiting businesses lacking strategic focus. Proceeds from these divestitures were channeled into further acquisitions, targeted financial assets, share repurchases and dividend payments, including a $2.50 per share special dividend in 2012 and $3.3 billion returned to shareholders over three years, thus preserving financial flexibility and supporting business continuity. At the same time, the company strengthened operational flexibility and risk mitigation by enhancing its analytics, data and desktop services with bundled solutions, expanded content and improved functionality, increased emphasis on digital capabilities to embed itself more deeply in customer workflows and to support service innovation, and aligned its practices with evolving U.S. and international regulatory requirements for credit ratings, benchmarks and financial research. Liquidity remained robust under a fully committed $1 billion credit facility, and free cash flow generation and disciplined capital management underpinned the company’s ability to absorb external disturbances while pursuing its two strategic priorities—customer-focused innovation to drive global growth and boosting operational excellence through productivity gains, enhanced compliance and talent development—each designed to maintain performance and integrity under challenging conditions.

The Company’s enterprise security platform supports organizational resilience by enabling enterprises, service providers, and government entities to “simultaneously empower and secure their organizations by safely enabling the increasingly complex and rapidly growing number of applications running on their networks and by preventing breaches stemming from targeted cyber attacks,” delivering system resilience through its next-generation firewall, advanced endpoint protection, and threat intelligence cloud. Its hybrid SaaS revenue model “increases deferred revenue balance and contributes significantly to our positive cash flow provided by operating activities,” while subscriptions and support and maintenance “provide end-customers with real-time access to the latest antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, and modern malware prevention capabilities across fixed and mobile devices,” preserving functioning under internal and external disturbances. To absorb strain and improve performance despite macroeconomic uncertainty, the Company invested approximately $25.0 million in research and development, customer support, and growing its advanced endpoint protection sales force, and extended its technology leadership with the acquisitions of Cyvera and Morta to “enhance our wildfire threat prevention offering,” enabling quick discovery and elimination of previously unknown malware, zero-day exploits, and advanced persistent threats. The May 2014 settlement with Juniper “resolves all pending litigation matters between us and will allow us to further focus on innovating and strengthening our product portfolio, servicing our customers, and growing our business,” reflecting reconfiguration of organizational resources to mitigate legal risk. For fiscal 2014, revenues grew 51.0% to $598.2 million and, together with billings of $771.4 million, demonstrate the Company’s ability to sustain growth under challenging conditions “despite continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment.” Management believes that future success “is dependent upon our ability to extend our technology leadership, grow our base of end-customers, expand deployment of our platform and services within existing end-customers, extend the length of service terms within existing end-customers, and focus on end-customer satisfaction,” and accordingly has strengthened its information technology and financial infrastructure, operating and administrative systems and controls, and its ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes efficiently to ensure business continuity and adaptability in response to disruptive events.

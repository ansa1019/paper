Our cloud networking solutions deliver industry-leading performance, scalability, availability, programmability, automation and visibility, underpinned by EOS, a fully programmable, highly modular operating system that has enabled rapid integration with third-party applications for virtualization, management, automation, orchestration and network services; we intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization to enhance the functionality of our existing platform, introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership, believing that these investments will allow us to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite internal or external pressures. In order to support our strong growth and improve operational continuity, we have accelerated investment in infrastructure such as enterprise resource planning software and other technologies to improve the efficiency of our operations and have diversified our supply chain by procuring merchant silicon components from multiple vendors and leveraging multiple direct fulfillment facilities. We also intend to expand our sales and marketing teams and network of international channel partners to extend our reach into key geographies, and we have established the Arista Partner Program to engage partners who provide value-added services, thereby strengthening inter-organizational collaboration and enhancing our ability to respond effectively to evolving customer needs. We believe one of our greatest strengths lies in the speed of our product development efforts and our flexibility in responding to disruptive change, while our liquidity strategy—comprising cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated from operations—together with our existing cash balances, is expected to be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and fund our growth strategies, even under conditions of uncertainty, intense competition and variable customer demand.

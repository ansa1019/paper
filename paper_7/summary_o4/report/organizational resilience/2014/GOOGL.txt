The Company anticipates continued pressure on overall margins as user behaviors and advertising shift from offline to online and to a dynamic multi‚Äêscreen environment and therefore seeks to expand its products and services to stay in front of this shift in order to maintain and grow its business. As users in developing economies increasingly come online, the Company continues to develop localized versions of its products and relevant advertising programs in emerging markets to diversify revenues and adapt to evolving customer needs. It maintains a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce exposure to fluctuations in currency rates and regularly assesses and adjusts its provision for income taxes and legal contingencies to mitigate risks. The Company continues to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus, such as search and advertising as well as new products and services, and its capital expenditures fluctuate as it invests heavily in systems, data centers, real estate, facilities, and information technology infrastructure to enhance operational flexibility and capacity. Acquisitions remain an important part of its strategy and use of capital, enhancing the breadth and depth of offerings and expanding expertise in engineering and other functional areas to reconstitute and reconfigure its capabilities. Recognizing that its employees are among its best assets, the Company expects to continue investing in talent through hiring and competitive compensation programs to preserve organizational health and performance. It manages its liquidity and capital resources through cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, a commercial paper program and a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility, believing these sources sufficient to satisfy anticipated cash requirements while acknowledging that additional financing may not be available on favorable terms. The Company monitors seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and commercial queries, tests goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently upon changes in circumstances, and periodically reviews its marketable and non-marketable securities for other-than-temporary impairments, all of which reflect a systemic perspective and adaptive strategies aimed at absorbing strain, preserving integrity and performance under internal and external variations, and enabling positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

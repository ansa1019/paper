In our executive overview we emphasize positioning the company for sustainable value creation over the long term by advancing our key priorities—brand building, innovation, productivity, execution and talent management—while tracking indicators such as organizational health, safety, product and service quality and innovation to help maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. To address uncertain macroeconomic, geopolitical and social instability and resource scarcity, we continue to strengthen our global presence and balance our portfolio across geographies and categories to navigate short-term volatility, broaden our product range with increased R&D investment to meet evolving consumer needs, and adapt to shifting customer channels through enhanced e-commerce and tailored customer strategies. We also focus on productivity initiatives—leveraging global scale, eliminating duplication, deploying new technologies, automating manufacturing, reengineering go-to-market systems, expanding shared services and simplifying organizational structures—to lower our cost base, deliver more than $1 billion in annual savings and reallocate resources to growth and resilience strategies. Our integrated risk management framework—overseen by the board and its committees, supported by a cross-functional corporate risk committee and division risk committees, and managed by a dedicated risk management office—enables us to identify, assess, prioritize, mitigate, monitor and communicate strategic, financial, operating, compliance, safety, reputational and other risks, absorbing economic, political and operational pressures to preserve or improve functioning amid adversity. We further enhance our resilience through sustainable business practices across our supply chain to conserve and replenish water, reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable agriculture, and by building and retaining top talent through globally integrated workforce planning and leadership development, all designed to preserve system integrity, maintain performance under pressure and enable the organization to reconstitute and reconfigure trajectories toward future growth.

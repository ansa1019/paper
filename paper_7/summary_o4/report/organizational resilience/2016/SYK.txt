In its 2016 Form 10-K, Stryker emphasizes maintenance of business continuity and preservation of performance under internal and external variations by generating substantial operating cash flows as the primary source of funding for operating needs and capital expenditures, deploying excess cash for strategic acquisitions and supplementing operating cash flow with debt as necessary, all within a global cash management strategy that accounts for liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations; management anticipates supporting short-term liquidity, operating needs, acquisitions and recall-related payments from a variety of sources including cash from operations, commercial paper and existing credit lines and maintains appropriate debt levels after evaluating cash flow expectations, funding requirements, investment and financing plans and overall cost of capital, further enhancing financial flexibility by increasing borrowing capacity under credit facilities and commercial paper programs; research, development and engineering spending on projects and investments in new technologies reflects continued investment in internal innovation and resource allocation to absorb strain and improve functioning; expense improvement initiatives, cost containment efforts and business mix leverage, including integration of recent acquisitions, mitigate external pressures and unfavorable mix; inventory reserves for excess and obsolete products demonstrate risk assessment and resource management under uncertainty, and deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain tax positions accounting, impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles and accruals for legal and recall contingencies represent proactive measures and strategic tools to manage hazards, maintain system integrity and adapt to evolving conditions in line with organizational resilience principles.

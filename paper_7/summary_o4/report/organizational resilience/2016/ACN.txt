The company’s MD&A emphasizes its ongoing efforts to absorb external pressures and preserve operational integrity by closely monitoring significant economic, geopolitical and currency volatility and “seeking to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions,” including restating results “in local currency” to neutralize foreign exchange impacts and employing customer contract currency protection provisions and hedging programs to manage cost exposures. Recognizing compensation as its largest expense, the firm “proactively plan[s] and manage[s] the size and composition of [its] workforce,” adjusting voluntary attrition, hiring levels, involuntary terminations and targeted compensation in key geographies and skill sets to maintain a supply of resources aligned with client demand, and “strive[s] to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on [its] gross margin.” It defers certain transition and set-up costs over the life of outsourcing contracts, records loss provisions when contract profitability declines and continuously implements cost-management actions to maintain performance under adverse conditions. The company believes that its substantial cash balances and projected operating cash flows will satisfy working capital and investment requirements for the next twelve months and that longer-term funding needs can be met through operating cash flows and unsecured revolving credit facilities providing capacity for general working capital and letters of credit. It further preserves strategic flexibility by deploying available funds to repurchase shares under open-market and leadership-holder programs, facilitate acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies, pursue expansion opportunities and develop new services, thereby reinforcing its ability to maintain continuity of operations, adapt to disruptions and emerge stronger from challenging environments.

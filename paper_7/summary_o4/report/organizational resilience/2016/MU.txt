Management’s discussion and analysis contains trend information and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including the sufficiency of our cash and investments, cash flows from operations, and available financing to meet our requirements for at least the next 12 months, and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include those identified in “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.” We are continuously evaluating alternatives for efficiently funding capital expenditures and ongoing operations, including the issuance or incurrence of secured and unsecured debt and the refinancing and restructuring of existing debt, and as of September 1, 2016, we had a revolving credit facility available for up to $488 million of additional financing based on eligible receivables, which we expect will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through the next 12 months. To develop new product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we continue to invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities and equipment, and research and development, estimating net cash expenditures in 2017 for property, plant, and equipment of approximately $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion, which reflects the offset of amounts we expect to be funded by our partners. From January 2013 through December 2015, we purchased all of Inotera’s DRAM output under supply agreements at prices reflecting discounts from market prices for our comparable components, and effective January 1, 2016, the price for DRAM products purchased by us is based on a formula that equally shares margin between Inotera and us; in the second quarter of 2016, we entered into agreements to acquire the remaining interest in Inotera for 30 New Taiwan dollars per share in cash (approximately $4.1 billion based on the September 1, 2016 exchange rate), supported by a term loan facility collateralized by Inotera’s assets and optional issuance of Micron shares and convertible senior notes, illustrating inter-organizational collaboration and strategic initiatives to secure supply chains and working capital. In response to the current business environment and the need to accelerate focus on our key priorities, we initiated a restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of 2016 expected to save approximately $80 million per quarter in 2017 through a more focused set of projects and programs, permanent closure of open headcount requisitions, workforce reductions in certain areas, and other non-headcount spending reductions, while SG&A expenses for 2016 decreased 8% as compared to 2015 due to suspension of variable-pay plans, decreases in travel costs, and an additional week in 2015. We generally share with Intel the costs of product design and process development activities for NAND flash and 3D XPoint memory, and our R&D expenses reflect net reductions of $208 million, $231 million, and $162 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, under cost-sharing arrangements. To mitigate credit risk, we invest through high-credit-quality financial institutions and, by policy, limit concentration of credit exposure by restricting investments with any single obligor; as of September 1, 2016, $1.32 billion of cash and equivalents and short-term investments was held by foreign subsidiaries, primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, and $896 million was held by the MMJ group, which is subject to corporate reorganization restrictions on dividends, loans, and advances. We operate in a number of locations outside the U.S., including Singapore and Taiwan, where we have tax incentive arrangements conditional upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds, which reduced our tax provision by $338 million in 2015 and $286 million in 2014. We recognize our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees on a two-month lag, including the impact of impairments, and we accrue liabilities for asserted and unasserted claims when probable and estimable, applying considerable judgment to estimate amounts and timing under contingencies. Goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if indicators exist, and impairment analyses employ estimates of future sales prices, sales volumes, costs, discount rates, and comparable market data to determine fair value. Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value, with net realizable value determined by projecting future selling prices, sales volumes, and costs to complete work in process, and inventory write-downs are recorded when estimated net realizable value falls below cost. Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows, and we revised the estimated useful lives of equipment in our DRAM wafer fabrication facilities from five to seven years in the fourth quarter of 2016. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred until product qualification, at which point subsequent product costs are included in cost of goods sold. Stock-based compensation is estimated at grant date based on fair-value models and recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, with expense for performance-based awards dependent on the probability of achieving specified performance measures, which we assess using forecasts of future performance and judgments regarding volatility, expected option life, and forfeiture rates.

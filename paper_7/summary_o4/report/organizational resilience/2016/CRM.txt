The discussion emphasizes our ongoing efforts to maintain operational flexibility and preserve performance under both nominal and challenging conditions by proactively allocating resources and adapting our organization to evolving customer and environmental pressures.  We continually evaluate opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, technologies and intellectual property, and we focus on our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies in order to expand service offerings, reconfigure capabilities and strengthen competitive advantage.  To address external economic uncertainties and customer attrition risks, we plan to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade customers to fully featured versions, provide high-quality technical support and foster third-party application development on our platforms, thereby reinforcing business continuity and resilience.  Our strategic initiatives include expansion of data center capacity, global infrastructure build-out, targeted hiring in sales, customer-related areas and research and development, and development of new services such as analytics, community and IoT clouds, which together reconstitute our resource deployment trajectory toward future growth.  We support operational continuity and positive adjustment by leveraging our multi-tenant architecture to reduce duplication of effort, by forecasting and managing seasonal billing and cash-flow cycles—acknowledging that our fourth quarter drives the majority of renewals and collections—and by maintaining sufficient liquidity through cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and debt facilities to fund capital expenditures, working capital needs and debt obligations.  We also preserve organizational health by investing in research and development to enhance functionality, security and ease of use, by allocating overhead and commission costs over contract terms, and by managing contractual commitments and lease renewal options to sustain performance and adaptability in turbulent markets.

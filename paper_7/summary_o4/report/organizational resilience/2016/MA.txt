Mastercard processes transactions from more than 210 countries and territories in over 150 currencies, leveraging geographic diversification to mitigate adverse economic conditions while acknowledging concentration risk in the United States. The company guarantees settlement risk under its Mastercard, Cirrus and Maestro networks, regularly reviews customer settlement exposures and global credit market developments, and employs foreign-exchange risk management—including derivative instruments—to manage translational and transactional currency variations that affect operating results, gross dollar volume and balance-sheet remeasurement. Management monitors political, economic and regulatory changes worldwide to inform strategic initiatives, plans and forecasts, evaluates performance using both GAAP and non-GAAP measures—excluding special items such as litigation provisions and pension settlement charges—and accrues probable and estimable litigation losses to maintain financial integrity. Mastercard maintains substantial liquidity and capital access through cash, cash equivalents, investment securities, a $3.75 billion committed revolving credit facility, a commercial paper program and shelf registration for debt and equity instruments, thereby enabling funding of global operations, capital expenditures and potential obligations. A discretionary share-repurchase program provides flexibility to address operating needs, market conditions and legal requirements. Through these diversified resources, ongoing planning and oversight, and formal governance of risk exposures, Mastercard seeks to sustain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, preserve or improve functioning, and maintain organizational integrity and performance continuity in the face of internal and external variations.

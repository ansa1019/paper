Given the mixed economic environment and continued industrial weakness in 2016, management noted that it “continued to adjust our air capacity and cost structure in our transportation network to better match the prevailing volume levels,” relying on “our broad portfolio of product offerings and the flexibilities inherent in our transportation network” to adapt to shifting trade patterns, e-commerce growth and currency fluctuations.  In response to ongoing external pressures, the company “undertook several initiatives in the U.S. and internationally to (1) improve the flexibility and capacity in our transportation network; (2) improve yield management; and (3) increase operational efficiency and contain costs across all segments,” including the deployment of facility automation projects and accelerated roll-out of its on-road integrated optimization and navigation system (“ORION”) to enhance network capacity, operational efficiency, flexibility and reliability.  Management further noted that the “utilization of newly expanded operating facilities” has improved time-in-transit, and that productivity gains from ORION have contained increases in vehicle miles driven despite growing volume, thereby preserving network integrity and service continuity under challenging conditions.  The firm also highlighted its continued use of purchased transportation and currency and fuel surcharge adjustments as strategic risk-mitigation measures to reconfigure capacity, manage cost volatility and maintain performance under pressure.

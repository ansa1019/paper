The Company continued to demonstrate adaptive capacity and operational flexibility in fiscal 2016 by recording and managing cumulative pretax expenses of $198 million related to the data breach discovered in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, maintaining self-insurance reserves for general liability, workers’ compensation, employee group medical and automobile claims, and carrying network security and privacy liability insurance to mitigate the impact of potential security incidents. We persisted in investing in interconnected capabilities to meet evolving customer demands for increased fulfillment options, completing deployment of our new COM platform across all U.S. stores and rolling out the BODFS program to complement existing retail programs; approximately 45 percent of online U.S. orders were fulfilled through BOPIS and BOSS offerings, online sales grew 19.3 percent to comprise 5.9 percent of total net sales, and we enabled a dynamic ETA feature to optimize delivery accuracy and conversion rates, while continuing to blend physical and digital assets to enhance end-to-end customer experience. Our ongoing multi-year Project Sync supply chain optimization initiative was deployed to all U.S. stores and new suppliers were onboarded to reduce supplier-to-shelf lead times, lower transportation expenses and improve inventory turns, reflecting a systemic perspective on resource reconfiguration and efficiency. In August 2015, we completed the $1.7 billion acquisition of Interline to establish a resilient MRO platform serving institutional customers, and we opened four new stores in Mexico, increasing geographic diversification. Liquidity and capital resources remained robust, with $9.8 billion of cash flow from operations supplemented by $5.0 billion of long-term debt and $360 million of short-term borrowings applied to repay matured notes, fund $6.9 billion of share repurchases, pay $3.4 billion of dividends and support $1.6 billion of capital expenditures, while maintaining $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, access to $2.0 billion of commercial paper with a committed back-up credit facility, and a disciplined capital allocation framework—demonstrated by the repurchase of 53 million shares for $7.0 billion, authorization of a new $15.0 billion repurchase program and a 29 percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend—underscoring the Company’s capacity to absorb strain, preserve positive adjustment under challenging conditions and sustain operational continuity. We employ interest rate swap agreements to manage market risk, resulting in 93 percent of debt at fixed rates, and maintain foreign currency exposure monitoring without material impact to financial condition. Critical accounting policies further support resilience through rigorous estimation and review of sales return liabilities, shrink reserves based on cycle counts and historical trends, lower-of-cost-or-market inventory valuation with regular physical counts, quarterly impairment assessments of long-lived assets and goodwill (with no impairments recorded in fiscal 2016), and detailed contractual obligation disclosures to ensure informed resource deployment and future planning.

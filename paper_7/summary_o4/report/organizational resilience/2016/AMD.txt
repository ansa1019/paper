In our MD&A, we describe how AMD continued to strengthen its competitive position and improve financial performance through disciplined expense management, the reduction and extension of debt maturities, and targeted R&D investments, thereby supporting the maintenance of operations under challenging market conditions. During 2016 we enhanced our resilience by using net proceeds from equity and convertible note issuances to repay $230 million of secured revolving credit and repurchase $796 million of senior notes, reducing total debt from $2.2 billion to $1.4 billion, and maintaining substantial cash and cash equivalents alongside an undrawn credit facility to fund operations and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months. To mitigate supply-chain risk and enable adaptive resource reconfiguration, we amended our wafer supply agreement with GlobalFoundries to establish a comprehensive framework for 7 nm technology collaboration, secure limited waivers for alternate foundry sourcing in 14 nm and 7 nm nodes, agree annual wafer purchase targets and fixed pricing, and diversify our manufacturing options. In support of operational continuity and external market expansion, we formed joint ventures in China—selling 85% of Suzhou ATMP operations to affiliates of TFME while retaining a 15% equity interest and entering the THATIC JV to license IP, provide engineering support and receive license fees and royalties for server-market expansion—thereby reallocating resources, absorbing strain, preserving critical services and fostering inter-organizational collaboration. We executed our product roadmap by delivering multiple new GPUs and APUs across desktop, mobile, embedded and semi-custom segments, reflecting service innovation and adaptability to customer needs and environmental turbulence. Our restructuring initiatives in 2015 and 2014, which involved global headcount reductions of approximately 5–6%, outsourcing of IT services, and real estate footprint realignments, are largely completed or winding down, with only $7 million of related liabilities remaining, demonstrating our capacity to reconfigure organizational structures and improve efficiencies. Net cash from operating activities improved to a $90 million inflow in 2016 from a $226 million outflow in 2015, driven by lower labor and restructuring payments, $97 million of license proceeds from the THATIC JV, stronger sales and receivables collections, partially offset by payable timing, underscoring our ability to absorb financial strain and maintain performance. We continue to manage critical accounting estimates—testing goodwill for impairment, valuing inventory based on future demand projections, and recording deferred tax assets subject to valuation allowances—to preserve system integrity and ensure transparent risk assessment. We also optimized our facility leases by amending the Sunnyvale lease to end in December 2017 and entering a ten-year lease for new Santa Clara offices beginning August 2017, with options to extend, thereby aligning operating parameters with strategic needs and workforce evolution. Throughout, we remain in compliance with debt covenants and cross-default provisions, preserving our liquidity and flexibility to respond to market volatility, which together reflect AMD’s commitment to “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.”

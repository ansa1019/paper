In our cable communications segment, we made targeted investments to improve the customer experience by hiring additional personnel and developing and deploying various technology and software tools; we increased capital expenditures primarily due to greater investment in line extensions for business services, scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity, and the continued deployment of our wireless gateways, X1 platform and cloud DVR technology, all of which support growth in high-speed internet, video and voice services and help us attract and retain customers under competitive and rapidly changing conditions. We use operating income before depreciation and amortization to allocate resources and capital among operating segments and to evaluate our performance against industry peers, thereby enabling strategic resource management and operational flexibility. Recognizing the seasonal and cyclical nature of our businesses—driven by residential churn, advertising cycles, sporting events and film release schedules—we continually adapt our pricing, negotiate distribution and licensing agreements, expand our network of residential, outdoor and business Wi-Fi hotspots and introduce new attractions at our theme parks to preserve functioning and maintain performance under environmental perturbations, consumer behavior shifts and intense competition. Our NBCUniversal segments further enhance resilience through content innovation and diversification—acquiring DreamWorks Animation, broadcasting the Olympic Games, premiering sports programming such as NASCAR and Thursday Night Football, and systematically investing in new theme-park attractions—which allows us to absorb strain, reconfigure our offerings and sustain operating margins amid fluctuating advertising revenues and viewership patterns. We maintain liquidity and business continuity through robust cash flows, substantial availability under credit facilities and commercial paper programs, and disciplined capital allocation to meet working capital requirements, service fixed charges and fund strategic initiatives. To safeguard organizational health, we annually assess indefinite-lived intangible assets such as cable franchise rights using qualitative and quantitative fair-value tests based on projected cash flows, market transactions and weighted-average cost of capital to ensure their carrying values remain supported under internal or external disturbances. In our filmed-entertainment operations, we capitalize and amortize production and acquisition costs, update ultimate revenue estimates based on theatrical performance and licensing projections, and perform impairment tests on programming assets— including multiyear sports rights—to mitigate performance variability, reallocate resources as needed and maintain overall system integrity and resilience.

Throughout fiscal 2016 and into early 2017, we have demonstrated the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions by continuously enhancing our omni-channel capabilities—upgrading lowes.com search algorithms, content recommendations, click-to-chat and multimedia tools; expanding lowesforpros.com functionality to streamline requisition lists, purchase history and online ordering; and rolling out interior and exterior project specialist programs to capture in-home demand—while leveraging larger store formats and customer experience expertise to create cohesive product assortments that drive differentiation and competitive advantage. We advanced our product and service offerings for the professional customer through targeted improvements in inventory depth, national and local brand assortment, and dedicated proservices teams, thereby reconfiguring resources to support evolving customer needs and operational flexibility. The acquisition and integration of Rona in Canada illustrate our ability to absorb strategic initiatives, preserve functioning and emerge stronger by enhancing customer relevance, expanding market reach and leveraging shared supplier relationships, scale and private-label brand capabilities. Our risk mitigation and business continuity measures include diversified liquidity sources—operating cash flow, short-term commercial paper and a $1.75 billion amended credit facility extending maturity to 2021 with optional expansion—together with prudent debt ratings, self-insurance programs, inventory obsolescence and shrinkage reserves, and disciplined capital expenditures in existing stores, distribution facilities, information technology and expansion projects. We have applied systematic reviews of long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment when cash flow trends and strategic reassessments indicate, and we continue to deploy forward-looking risk assessments in light of macroeconomic forecasts, all of which reflect our systemic perspective, absorptive capacity and dynamic capabilities to preserve or improve our performance under internal or external variations and disturbances.

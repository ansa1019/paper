KKR emphasizes that global and regional economic conditions have a substantial impact on its financial condition and operations, influencing the value of investments, its ability to exit profitably and to make new investments. The firm notes that periods of volatility and dislocation in the capital markets present substantial risks but also create opportunities to invest at reduced valuations that position it for future growth, demonstrating the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. KKR’s response to fluctuating credit spreads, interest rates and foreign‐exchange exposures—including discounted cash flow modeling, proactive liquidity management and flexible capital buffers—underscores its operational flexibility and resource efficiency. The adoption of updated consolidation guidance, which de-consolidated most of its investment funds without impacting net income, and the firm’s long-term investment horizon and dynamic capital allocation approach—manifested in active fund restructurings, strategic partnerships and diversified deployment across private equity, real assets, liquid credit and capital markets—reflect a systemic perspective and adaptive resource reconfiguration designed to uphold functioning and performance despite internal or external variations. Through continued diversification, active fund‐level liquidity management and ongoing refinement of its fee and carried-interest structures, KKR safeguards business continuity, mitigates adverse effects of external perturbations and preserves competitive advantage under turbulent market conditions.

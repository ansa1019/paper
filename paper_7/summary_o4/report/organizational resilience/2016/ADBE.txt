During the period, we integrated acquired businesses such as Fotolia into our digital media reportable segment and adopted flexible operating practices that enabled us to expand and improve our technology to keep pace with change, provide enhancements to our tools to meet industry needs and support customers at each stage of their life cycle; the adoption of Creative Cloud has transformed our business model by lowering the cost of entry, delivering additional features and value, enabling us to acquire new users, keep existing customers current, grow a recurring and predictable revenue stream and attract more new customers through targeted promotions and offers and new mobile applications; we have built out a marketplace for subscribers to deliver and purchase stock content and deployed a direct salesforce and an extensive ecosystem of partners, including marketing agencies, systems integrators and developers, reflecting significant investments in route-to-market scalability; we expect that the integration of TubeMogul and sustained demand across our Marketing Cloud solutions will drive future revenue growth; we regularly evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates, which are based on historical experience and reasonable factors under the circumstances, to mitigate risk and ensure the integrity of our financial reporting; our investments in research and development, including recruiting software developers, are deemed critical to maintaining competitiveness and to the timely development of new and enhanced service offerings, applications and tools; our data center investments and related third-party costs have scaled with increased transaction volumes in our Adobe Marketing Cloud and Creative Cloud services; the unbilled deferred revenue backlog represents contractually committed future billings that vary with subscription timing, renewal cycles and foreign currency fluctuations; and we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, investment balances, anticipated cash flows from operations and available credit facility will be sufficient to meet working capital and operating resource requirements for the next twelve months.

PepsiCo emphasizes its embedded “performance with purpose” approach, asserting that its performance is “inextricably linked to the sustainability of the world in which we operate” and believing that this strategy “positions our company for long-term sustainable growth” even in volatile conditions. Management highlights a forward-looking focus on performance metrics including organizational health, safety, innovation and productivity savings, and commits to investments in research and development and automation as part of a productivity agenda that has delivered approximately $1 billion in annual savings since 2012, ranging from development of agricultural technologies to local sourcing. The company reports ongoing efforts to reduce its environmental footprint, streamline costs and reinvest savings, including water and energy efficiency improvements, packaging material reductions, waste cuts and promotion of sustainable farming practices that have saved over $600 million in five years. Recognizing a range of challenges—uncertain and volatile macroeconomic conditions, currency fluctuations, climate change, water scarcity, political, economic and social instability, shifting consumer demand and regulatory pressures—PepsiCo emphasizes its integrated risk management framework, under board oversight, that “identifies, assesses, prioritizes, addresses, manages, monitors and communicates” strategic, financial, operating, compliance, safety, reputational and other top risks, supported by division and country risk committees, a risk management office, corporate audit evaluations of internal controls and a compliance & ethics department. The company also notes the use of global purchasing programs, fixed-price contracts, productivity initiatives and hedging activities—including centrally managed commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and net investment hedges—to mitigate market, supply and price risks, maintain operational flexibility and protect cash flows. PepsiCo further describes actions to “continue to focus on skills upgrading and job retraining, creating new opportunities for our workers,” thereby enhancing its ability to navigate “continued geopolitical uncertainty and unrest,” and to collaborate with retail and farm partners to foster business continuity, service quality and community resilience in more than 200 countries and territories.

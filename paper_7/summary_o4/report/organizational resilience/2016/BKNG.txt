Management’s discussion and analysis highlights our ongoing efforts to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions by evaluating key operating and financial measures on both an as-reported and constant-currency basis, recognizing that uncertainty in the European Union and China, adverse economic conditions, sovereign debt risks, geopolitical tensions, extreme weather, health pandemics and fluctuating exchange rates can lead to volatility in transaction growth rates, cancellation rates and average daily rates.  We employ derivative instruments and natural hedges to minimize the impact of short-term currency fluctuations on our consolidated results and adapt to rapidly changing market conditions—such as technological developments, consumer shifts to mobile platforms, regulatory changes, promotional pricing to closed user groups and travel service provider consolidation—while continuously monitoring seasonality effects on the timing of advertising expenses and revenue recognition.  We invest in marketing, promotion, technology and personnel to drive long-term operating results, balance margin pressures with growth priorities, broaden our service offerings to enhance flexibility and resilience, and maintain sufficient cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments to fund our operations and capital expenditures even under extreme conditions.  In response to evolving circumstances, including the slower-than-expected returns on certain international expansion initiatives, we revise forecasts, reconstitute and reconfigure strategic trajectories—illustrated by the measured and deliberate adjustment of Opentable’s growth strategy and associated goodwill impairment—and pursue strategic alternatives such as mergers and acquisitions to reallocate resources, preserve system integrity, ensure business continuity and bolster our ability to emerge stronger from disruptive events.

Management’s enterprise risk management framework, approved by the board of directors, defines the company’s risk appetite and assigns accountability for risk identification, measurement, monitoring, reporting and mitigation to business and control units under the oversight of a global risk committee and its functional sub-committees covering operational, credit, market, liquidity, compliance and model risk.  In accordance with final recovery planning guidelines issued by the OCC for banks with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, Schwab Bank is required to develop and maintain a recovery plan that describes how it will restore financial health and viability in response to a wide range of external and internal financial and operational stress scenarios.  The company regularly conducts liquidity stress testing, maintains liquidity policies and contingency funding scenarios, and complies with the fully phased-in modified liquidity coverage ratio, while a capital contingency plan and capital stress testing simulate adverse macroeconomic and company-specific events—including scenarios of substantial balance sheet cash inflows under very low interest rates and forced asset sales under funding constraints—to ensure sufficient capital to absorb unexpected losses.  Operational risk management is supported by policies, risk and control self-assessments, control testing programs, an insurance program and an operational risk oversight committee, while critical business functions are protected by backup and recovery infrastructure, geographically dispersed workforce arrangements and routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans.  An information security program integrates tools, controls and technologies to protect systems, client accounts and data, employing continuous monitoring, advanced intrusion detection, multi-factor authentication measures, employee privacy and security training and vendor risk management.  Model governance policies address the lifecycle of quantitative models through registration, classification, validation and ongoing review.  These integrated risk management, recovery planning and operational resilience practices enable the company to absorb strain, maintain its integrity and performance under internal or external variations and disturbances, and adapt to emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

In managing our business through a challenging environment of significant volatility and uncertainty, we deploy a system‐wide approach to maintain operational continuity and performance under internal and external pressures, including balancing supply chain flexibility against inventory obsolescence risk via regular evaluation of excess and obsolete inventories and purchase commitments, and adjusting our allowances for receivables and financing guarantees based on historical experience, credit quality, economic conditions, and expected default frequency rates. We strategically realign and deploy resources through targeted investments, capital allocation decisions, and restructuring actions—reinvesting cost savings in priority areas such as security, collaboration, next‐generation data center and cloud, and customer‐facing services—to drive long‐term growth regardless of the environment. Our enterprise‐wide risk management processes encompass ongoing monitoring and adjustment of fair‐value measurements, impairment testing for goodwill and purchased intangible assets, and assessment of liabilities related to product warranties, loss contingencies, and financing arrangements, ensuring we absorb strain, preserve integrity, and adapt functioning in the face of disruptions. We maintain robust liquidity through free cash flow generation, disciplined working capital management, diversified financing programs, and committed credit facilities to satisfy operating needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions, shareholder returns, and contractual obligations, while modeling the impacts of currency fluctuations, tax uncertainties, and demand shifts to help both our organization and our customers foresee, confront, and emerge stronger from disruptive change.

Some of the information contained in this discussion, including forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, underscores our awareness of potential disruptions and the need for risk mitigation strategies. We continue to invest in the development of our services, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth, including data center capacity expansion, hosting services, interconnectivity, depreciation of cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment dedicated for customer use, and data backup and disaster recovery services, which collectively support operational continuity and system integrity under varying conditions. Pricing includes multiple instances, hosting and support services, data backup and disaster recovery services, as well as future upgrades offered during the subscription term, enabling customers to maintain performance and positive adjustment in challenging circumstances. We believe billings and free cash flow are useful leading indicators regarding the strength and performance of our business operations, as they reflect how management evaluates and allocates resources, monitors billings duration and timing of collections, and responds to foreign currency rate fluctuations. Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations, and we anticipate these will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months, although adequacy beyond that period will depend on our growth, operating results, cash utilized for acquisitions, capital expenditures and the ability to seek additional equity or debt financing if required. Foreign currency rate fluctuations have had an unfavorable impact on our revenues and billings, demonstrating our exposure to external perturbations, and we maintain a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets in accordance with prudent tax planning. Net cash provided by operating activities reflects our adaptive resource management, including adjustments for non-cash items and the impact of cash paid for aggregate legal settlements, while net cash used in investing activities highlights our commitment to capital expenditures and strategic investments in cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment to support data center growth. We expect cost of subscription revenues to increase in absolute dollars but at a slower rate than subscription revenue growth, leading to incremental improvements in gross profit percentage as we continue to leverage investments in our existing data center infrastructure and achieve economies of scale. Contractual commitments for operating leases covering offices and data centers further illustrate our forward-looking resource deployment to sustain operations under variable demands, and our research and development investments—consisting of personnel expenses, data center capacity costs, amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of cloud-based infrastructure hardware used solely for R&D—underline our ongoing efforts to improve functionality, develop new applications to fill market needs and enhance our core platform in response to market evolution.

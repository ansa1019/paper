Managementâ€™s discussion and analysis underscores our strategic allocation of resources and operational measures designed to absorb strain and preserve performance under challenging conditions. We have continued to invest, based on our roadmap, in our ecosystem including the Facebook app, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp and in long-term technology initiatives such as virtual reality and artificial intelligence, while expanding data center capacity, network infrastructure, and office facilities to support rapid user growth and engagement. We anticipate growing expenses in 2017 as we hire top engineering talent, invest in research and development, content, and sales efforts, and expand our technical infrastructure, reflecting our systemic perspective and future orientation. Our risk assessment processes include forward-looking statements and constant currency measures to mitigate foreign exchange impacts, quarterly review and adjustment of loss contingencies, periodic remeasurement of deferred tax assets and income tax positions including an IRS transfer-pricing dispute, and annual impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets to reconfigure resources in response to changing circumstances. We maintain liquidity through $29.45 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and an undrawn $2.0 billion credit facility, and we recently authorized a $6.0 billion share repurchase program and shifted to net share settlement of equity award withholding to preserve operational flexibility. These strategies, coupled with transparent non-GAAP financial measures and ongoing evaluation of critical accounting estimates based on historical experience, collectively enhance our adaptability, risk mitigation, and organizational strength.

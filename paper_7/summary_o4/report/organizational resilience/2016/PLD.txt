Management’s discussion underscores the Company’s capacity to preserve and improve functioning under challenging conditions through proactive resource allocation, operational flexibility and strategic risk mitigation.  In the overview, management attributes its competitive advantage and resilience to the “quality and scale of our global operating portfolio, the expertise of our team and the strength of our balance sheet,” reflecting a systemic perspective on maintaining continuity and performance under external pressures.  The plan to grow revenues, earnings, NOI, cash flows and FFO relies on sustained rent growth—highlighted by positive rent change on rollovers each quarter since 2013 despite market volatility—and value creation from development by “maintaining control of well-positioned land,” supporting adaptive strategies and resource reconfiguration.  Investments in technologies and advanced data analysis have enabled a 16% increase in assets under management with minimal overhead growth, achieving economies of scale and streamlined operations.  Operating fundamentals remained strong in 2016, with consolidated and unconsolidated occupancy above 97%, evidencing the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve integrity and performance.  Liquidity and capital resources are diversified across operating cash flows, fee and promote revenues from co-investment ventures, contributions and dispositions of real estate assets, notes receivable repayments and undrawn credit facilities, enabling execution of development completions, capital expenditures, debt repayment and strategic acquisitions while preserving business continuity.  The Company demonstrates risk mitigation and adaptability by amending and extending global credit facilities and unsecured term loans—including a ¥120 billion yen facility maturing through 2023—managing interest expense via targeted debt repurchases and early extinguishment, and employing hedging strategies to manage foreign currency and interest-rate exposures.  Performance measurement uses same-store analyses and FFO measures adjusted for nonrecurring gains or losses, derivatives, tax effects and acquisition-related items, facilitating an organizational intelligence framework to evaluate core operations independent of market perturbations.  Finally, critical accounting policies—such as impairment testing of long-lived assets, fair value allocation in business combinations, revenue recognition on contributions and dispositions, and comprehensive consolidation assessments—support organizational resilience by ensuring transparency, integrity and agility in financial reporting and decision making.

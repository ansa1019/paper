The company’s discussion emphasizes the role of various risk-mitigation and resource-allocation strategies that support its ability to maintain performance under challenging conditions, including its management of research and development spending across its portfolio so that a delay or termination of any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in total research and development spending, its acknowledgement of inherent risks and uncertainties in the research and development process that preclude precise estimates of project costs and future revenue potential, and its periodic review of the carrying value of long-lived and intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate recoverability may be affected. As a global enterprise, the company faces foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating exchange rates and employs hedging and other financial risk-management techniques to limit the impact on earnings, while its controlled program of derivative financial instruments for interest-rate and currency exposures, and its belief in the adequacy of commercial paper markets to fund short-term borrowing needs, reflect system resilience, strategic foresight, and operational continuity planning. The company also notes the impact of the Venezuelan financial crisis, including the significant deterioration of the bolívar that led to a $203.9 million charge in 2016, and continues to monitor deteriorating economies to mitigate future charges, illustrating crisis response and recovery strategies. In addition, the company’s corporate risk management includes ongoing monitoring of the economic environment, customer creditworthiness, healthcare legislation, and government funding levels, while its collaborative research and development arrangements with third parties provide contingent milestone and royalty payments that serve as indicators of progress and potential cash-flow generation, demonstrating adaptive strategies, inter-organizational collaboration, and future orientation. Finally, strategic acquisitions—such as the agreements to purchase Colucid Pharmaceuticals, the U.S. vaccine portfolio of Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, and Novartis Animal Health—highlight its capability to reconfigure resources and strengthen its position in the face of market disruptions.

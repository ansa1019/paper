Nike’s management discussion describes multiple strategies and processes that support the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve performance under adversity: the company makes its supply chain a competitive advantage by investing in new technologies that increase automation, reduce waste and accelerate speed to market; it expands and deepens its direct-to-consumer operations to diversify channels and enhance operational flexibility; it optimizes selling and administrative expenses through infrastructure and digital capability investments that improve efficiency and effectiveness; and it manages working capital efficiency and capital deployment to ensure liquidity and continuity. A centrally managed foreign exchange risk program, including factory-input cost adjustments and forward-contract and option hedges, mitigates external currency pressures on product costs and earnings, while committed credit facilities and a $2 billion commercial paper program provide financing agility under market volatility. Nike’s swift logistical response to west coast port congestion, use of air freight to mitigate delays and ongoing refinements to product design and manufacturing processes illustrate adaptive resource reconfiguration. Despite significant foreign currency headwinds, these resilience-enhancing measures have enabled record revenue and margin expansion, demonstrating the firm’s capacity to maintain integrity and achieve sustainable, profitable growth in challenging conditions.

Gilead operates in more than 30 countries worldwide, leveraging geographic diversification and inter-organizational collaborations under royalty-paying agreements to absorb external variations and support business continuity. The Company advances its product pipeline through internal discovery, clinical development, product acquisition and in-licensing strategies, allocating R&D resources dynamically by prioritizing activities based on scientific data, success probabilities, market potential and available human and capital resources, and periodically reallocating those resources to preserve functioning and support growth. To mitigate foreign exchange risks, Gilead uses currency hedges and records product sales net of estimated government and private payer deductions—updating these gross-to-net estimates each period to reflect changing regulations and utilization rates. Management remains committed to strong operating and financial discipline, believes existing capital resources supplemented by operating cash flows will satisfy foreseeable capital needs, and maintains liquidity through senior unsecured notes, a new $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility, share repurchase programs and a regular dividend policy, thereby reinforcing its strategic flexibility. In its 2017 outlook the Company acknowledges significant external pressures—including uncertain macroeconomic conditions, pricing and competitive pressures, regulatory and payer mix shifts and currency volatility—and outlines strategic initiatives to support uptake of newly launched regimens, patient access, diagnostic and educational programs and the continuation of late-stage clinical studies, all intended to maintain performance under challenging conditions.

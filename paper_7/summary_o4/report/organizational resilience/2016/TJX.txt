The company continued to generate strong cash flows and returned value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while reinvesting in its business by adding new stores, remodeling existing ones, and strengthening infrastructure—particularly offices, distribution centers, buying and merchandising systems, and information systems—to support ongoing growth and operational flexibility. It routinely employs inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on merchandise costs and records mark-to-market adjustments until the related inventory is received, thereby preserving profit margins under adverse market conditions. Improvements in cost of sales ratios resulted from enhanced merchandise margins and leverage on buying and occupancy costs, although these gains were partially offset by higher supply chain and store payroll costs due to wage increases and increased processing of units at the store level. Capital expenditures, expected to reach approximately $1.2 billion in fiscal 2018, are funded by internally generated funds and supplemented by existing credit facilities and cash reserves held both domestically and abroad, ensuring adequate liquidity for working capital, seasonal merchandise needs, and strategic initiatives. General corporate expenses reflect continued investments in corporate systems, technology, compensation, benefits, and professional services to maintain organizational capabilities. The company’s self-insured casualty insurance program and qualified pension plan rely on actuarial assumptions and ongoing funding to address future liabilities, while reserves for uncertain tax positions and accruals for loss contingencies demonstrate proactive risk assessment and reserve management. Annual impairment testing of long-lived assets, goodwill, and tradenames—using discounted cash flow methods with assumptions for weighted average cost of capital and growth rates—provides a systemic perspective on the recoverability of asset values, notably for businesses undergoing model transitions such as Sierra Trading Post. Through these measures—spanning risk mitigation, resource reconfiguration, strategic investment, and financial flexibility—the company preserves or improves its operational performance, adapts to environmental perturbations, and maintains integrity under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

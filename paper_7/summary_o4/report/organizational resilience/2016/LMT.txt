We operate in an environment characterized by both increasing complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures, and a significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S. and international customers at affordable prices. Recognizing that our customers are resource constrained, we continually strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet current and future needs through independent research and development and by selectively pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and internal realignment activities that expand or complement our core capabilities, allow access to new customers or technologies and divest businesses that no longer meet our needs or strategy. We also endeavor to develop adjacent markets close to our core, grow our international sales, focus on affordability initiatives and invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements as well as invest in our people so that we have the technical skills necessary to succeed. We generate strong operating cash flows, maintain access to multiple capital markets and credit facilities and manage working capital, customer advances and progress payments to ensure operational continuity and resilience under funding uncertainties, including potential continuing resolutions or government shutdowns, by funding customer programs ourselves when necessary and preserving financial flexibility to support our operations and anticipated capital expenditures. Our approach to contract accounting and pricing, including performance-based payments under cost-reimbursable and fixed-price contracts, allows us to monitor progress, assess risks, retire uncertainties and recover allowable environmental and pension costs over time, thereby supporting our ability to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning under internal or external variations and disturbances and adapt our organizational and financial structure to emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

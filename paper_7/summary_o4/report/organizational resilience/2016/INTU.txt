Our management’s discussion and analysis describes an operating environment characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements, reflecting external pressures and environmental turbulence that require ongoing adaptation to sustain business continuity. We note a global market shift from traditional paper-based, human-produced, brick-and-mortar services to connected services, driving resource reconfiguration and strategic resilience across our businesses. We acknowledge significant seasonality in our consumer tax offerings—third-quarter revenues have represented nearly half of annual revenue—and expect this pattern to continue, underscoring the importance of operational flexibility and positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Our growth strategy depends on initiating and embracing disruptive technology trends, entering new markets, driving broad adoption of our products and services, and allocating significant resources to product development, marketing, and sales capabilities. As we transition toward more connected services, we emphasize the ongoing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems, invest in IT infrastructure, privacy and security capabilities to mitigate risks associated with data hosting, collection, use, and retention, and implement additional security measures to combat fraud, thereby enhancing our capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity. We evaluate potential acquisitions and strategic relationships on an ongoing basis, and our strong liquidity profile enables nimble response to emerging opportunities, while we monitor counterparty risk and maintain compliance with financial covenants to preserve system integrity. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents, and investments, together with cash generated from operations, will meet seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, and other liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months, and we intend to deploy excess cash through stock repurchases and dividends after addressing operating and strategic cash needs, reflecting dynamic resource allocation and organizational resilience. Our unsecured revolving credit facility, available for general corporate purposes including future acquisitions and stock repurchases, and our unsecured term loan, whose interest rate and amortization terms support financial flexibility, further bolster operational continuity and risk management under varying economic conditions. We plan to reinvest a significant portion of foreign earnings and have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements, thereby maintaining a systemic perspective on risk mitigation, resource management, and future orientation that underpins our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and emerge stronger from challenging situations.

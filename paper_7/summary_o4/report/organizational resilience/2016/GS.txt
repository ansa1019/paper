Goldman Sachs describes a comprehensive resilience framework built around business continuity planning, capital and liquidity management, rigorous stress testing and governance to preserve its ability to sustain operations and performance under adverse conditions. The firm highlights forward-looking disclosures concerning “the objectives and effectiveness of our business continuity plan, information security program, risk management and liquidity policies,” and the submission of periodic resolution plans and global recovery plans to regulators to ensure an “orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress” and the conservation of capital and liquidity during “prolonged stress.” It maintains a contingency funding plan that pre-funds potential cash and collateral outflows through “global core liquid assets…readily convertible to cash…to meet immediate obligations without needing to sell other assets” and employs active asset-liability management, credit and market risk limits, and scenario analyses—including modelled liquidity outflows, intraday stress models and firmwide stress tests mandated by CCAR and DFAST—to assess and mitigate exposures across a range of macroeconomic and firm-specific scenarios. Independent control functions for market, credit, operational and model risk undertake daily monitoring, VaR and scenario analyses, self-assessments and backtesting under board-approved policies to detect and control exposures arising from market volatility, credit events, process failures or systems disruptions. Senior management and specialized committees review key risk metrics, approve limits, validate models and adjust strategic responses, thereby enabling the firm to absorb strain, maintain integrity and preserve performance under challenging and exceptional conditions.

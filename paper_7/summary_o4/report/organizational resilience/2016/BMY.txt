In October 2016, we announced an evolution to our operating model designed to enhance our ability to maintain performance under challenging conditions by focusing commercial and R&D resources on key brands and markets, delivering leaner administrative functions and streamlining our manufacturing network to reflect the growing importance of biologics in our portfolio; this reconfigured model is intended to provide the strategic, financial and operational flexibility necessary to allocate resources to highest priorities, sustain business continuity and support continuous improvement. Our strategy of combining the scale and capability of a large pharmaceutical company with the speed and innovation focus of the biotech industry, underpinned by disciplined capital allocation, a diversified portfolio strategy and essential partnerships and collaborations, fosters adaptability to external pressures and resilience in the face of setbacks such as the CheckMate-026 trial results. Management continuously evaluates our capital structure through share repurchases, debt financing and hedging to mitigate financial risks and preserve firm performance, while governance processes established under the SEC consent order and FCPA settlement strengthen risk mitigation, compliance and oversight of inventory levels. Looking ahead, we will implement our biopharma strategy by driving key brand growth, executing product launches, investing in our diverse and innovative pipeline including through business development, prioritizing markets, increasing investments in biologics manufacturing capabilities and maintaining a culture of continuous improvement, thereby reinforcing our capacity to absorb strain, reconfigure operations and maintain integrity and performance amid environmental turbulence.

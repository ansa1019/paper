Management uses earnings excluding certain items (adjusted earnings), a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, for analysis of performance, for reporting of results to the board of directors and as an input in determining performance-based compensation under NEE’s employee incentive compensation plans, and believes that adjusted earnings provides a more meaningful representation of NEE’s fundamental earnings power, reflecting a strategic approach to performance measurement under volatile market conditions; NEE segregates unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on derivative transactions into non-qualifying hedges—energy derivative, interest rate and foreign currency transactions that do not meet or elect hedge accounting treatment—and trading activities, deferring qualifying hedges at FPL as regulatory assets or liabilities until settlement and excluding non-qualifying hedge activity from adjusted earnings to mitigate earnings volatility and support visibility into ongoing operations. In order to ensure business continuity and support growth, NEE and its subsidiaries require funds to support and grow their businesses—including working capital, capital expenditures, investments in or acquisitions of assets and businesses, payment of maturing debt obligations and, from time to time, redemption or repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities—and anticipate satisfying these requirements through a combination of cash flows from operations, borrowings, issuances of short- and long-term debt, equity securities and proceeds from differential membership investors, while maintaining, on a long-term basis, a capital structure to support a strong investment grade credit rating and preserve access to credit and capital markets. NEE’s liquidity, cost of capital and execution of financing strategies depend on maintaining current credit ratings; to manage liquidity risk, NEE and its subsidiaries maintain bank revolving line of credit facilities, letter of credit facilities, commercial paper programs and credit enhancements—including guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds—and closely monitor credit exposures under master netting agreements, collateral requirements and established credit policies. NEE and its subsidiaries manage commodity price, interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk by using derivative instruments (swaps, options, futures and forwards) to hedge exposures inherent in fuel and electricity purchases and sales, interest-bearing debt issuances and gas production hedges, with NEE’s exposure management committee and chief executive officer overseeing market risk management policies, periodic reviews of market positions, related exposures and credit exposures, and employing value-at-risk models to estimate potential nominal losses under hypothetical market shifts. NEE’s capital initiatives include planned additions of generation capacity—FPL’s 1,750 MW Okeechobee clean energy center by mid-2019 and up to 300 MW of new solar annually through 2020, and NEER’s addition of approximately 2,400 to 4,100 MW of contracted wind generation and 400 to 1,300 MW of solar in 2017–2018—demonstrating proactive resource deployment, operational flexibility and future orientation to sustain performance under evolving environmental and market conditions. Critical accounting policies requiring significant judgments and estimates include the fair value measurement of derivative instruments under both observable and unobservable inputs, assessments of asset retirement obligations and decommissioning costs for nuclear and other generation plants, and actuarial assumptions for pension obligations, reflecting NEE’s systemic approach to ensuring the maintenance of integrity and performance despite internal and external variations and uncertainties.

Sound risk management and enterprise resilience are embedded throughout our governance framework, which is predicated on an articulated risk appetite approved by the board and enforced through a three-lines-of-defense model and a robust identify-measure-monitor-control process.  We maintain a culture of managing risk well as a core value and operate under a comprehensive risk framework that integrates strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risk considerations into corporate planning, capital allocations and contingency funding plans.  Our contingency planning and recovery strategies enable us to prepare for and respond effectively to adverse economic, financial and market stress by establishing escalation routines, maintaining global liquidity sources and prepositioning capital resources, while our capital management processes ensure we continue to operate “well capitalized” under Basel III, even during periods of stress, and to support organic growth, satisfy future regulatory requirements and meet creditor and counterparty obligations.  Strategic risk oversight includes annual board reviews of our operating and capital plans, ongoing stress testing under baseline and severe scenarios and dynamic adjustments to business-unit return expectations, and our asset-and-liability management activities, including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate and currency exposures, enable us to maintain funding flexibility, manage balance sheet sensitivities and preserve operational continuity.  Proactive identification and mitigation of operational and compliance risks through enterprise-wide policies, scenario analysis and risk control self-assessments support our resilience to internal process failures, cybersecurity threats and evolving regulatory expectations, while contingency funding and recovery plans outline actions—asset sales, de-risking strategies or debt issuances—to restore adequate liquidity and capital in exceptional conditions.  Our commercial and consumer credit risk management processes, which include loan underwriting, portfolio risk rating, dynamic provisioning and iterative allowance methodologies, leverage historical loss data, vintage and geographic analyses, payment performance and home-price dynamics to absorb credit stress and preserve performance, even under adverse conditions.   In global markets and mortgage banking, we employ value-at-risk and stress-testing techniques to monitor and limit trading-related market risk and hedge production commitments and servicing rights in order to stabilize earnings and maintain business continuity in volatile markets.   This integrated framework of strategic planning, capital and liquidity safeguards, operational controls, credit loss forecasting and quantitative risk analytics supports the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions and the preservation of organizational integrity and performance.

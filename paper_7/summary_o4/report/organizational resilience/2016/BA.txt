We are a global market leader in commercial and defense aerospace whose strategy relies on an extensive network of international partners, key suppliers and subcontractors and is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses—commercial airplanes and defense, space & security—supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital, together generating earnings and cash flows that fund new products, services and efficiency and quality improvements. Commercial Airplanes pursues superior design, efficiency and customer value while Boeing Defense, Space & Security integrates resources across defense, intelligence, communications, security, space and services to deliver capability-driven solutions at reduced cost. We leverage cyclicality across markets and announced in November 2016 the formation of Boeing Global Services to reconfigure our commercial aviation and support businesses into an integrated services platform operational in the second half of 2017. Our long-term production and development programs—such as the KC-46A tanker, 747, 777X and 787—are inherently complex, involve extensive change incorporation, flight test and certification schedules, supply-chain coordination and dynamic cost and revenue estimates and remain subject to reach-forward losses if technical issues, schedule delays or increased costs arise; accordingly, we recorded reach-forward losses on the KC-46A program in 2016, 2015 and 2014, recognized a reduction of $1,235 million of 787 flight test aircraft costs to research and development expense in the second quarter of 2016 when the aircraft were deemed not commercially saleable, and reduced the 747 program accounting quantity in response to lower demand. We continue to implement mitigation plans, cost-reduction efforts and revised production rates to improve program profitability while monitoring external pressures—political unrest in Russia and Ukraine, continuing resolutions and potential government shutdowns, evolving airline market conditions, fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, natural disasters, conflicts and environmental regulations—that could materially impact our production, deliveries and customer financing. Many non-U.S. customers rely on the Export-Import Bank of the United States, and until its board quorum is reconstituted they may delay purchases; we are prepared to fund additional customer commitments and assist with alternative financing. Our long operating cycle encompasses diverse contract structures—fixed-price, cost-type, program accounting and contract accounting—requiring ongoing revision of cost, schedule, backlog and program accounting quantities, and the application of cumulative catch-up adjustments and provisions for reach-forward losses when future costs exceed estimated future revenues. We believe our liquidity, borrowing capacity and access to capital resources are sufficient to satisfy commitments and provide financial flexibility, though future availability and cost of borrowings cannot be assured, and while our GAAP-measured pension plans were $20.1 billion underfunded at December 31, 2016, on an ERISA basis they are fully funded with minimal required contributions in 2017, we expect to contribute approximately $0.5 billion and may need higher contributions in future years, underscoring our continued focus on risk assessment, operational flexibility and resource allocation to preserve functioning and maintain performance under challenging conditions.

AbbVie's organizational resilience is evidenced by its strategic emphasis on sustainable long‐term growth through diversified revenue streams, robust cash flow generation and targeted pipeline investments, as demonstrated by its use of $7.0 billion of operating cash flows in 2016 to enhance the pipeline via licensing and collaboration, support mid‐ and late‐stage assets and return value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The company maintains operational flexibility and continuity with a $3.0 billion five‐year revolving credit facility in compliance with covenants at year‐end and by managing its capital structure via senior note issuances and accelerated share repurchase agreements, authorizing multi‐billion‐dollar share repurchase programs with no time limits to adapt to market conditions. Resilience mechanisms include productivity initiatives across supply chain and manufacturing, ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure and corporate expenses, monitoring and adjusting rebate, chargeback and return accruals to mitigate working capital pressures, hedging foreign currency exposures and recording allowances to manage economic volatility in key markets, including devaluation losses related to Venezuela, and periodically re-evaluating credit risk in receivables from government health systems. AbbVie’s risk mitigation extends to contingent consideration liabilities revalued at each reporting date, R&D collaboration agreements that align milestone payments with development success, rigorous impairment testing of long-lived assets to preserve system integrity and maintenance of sufficient liquidity and credit ratings to support ongoing operations, acquisitions and regulatory milestones under varying environmental perturbations.

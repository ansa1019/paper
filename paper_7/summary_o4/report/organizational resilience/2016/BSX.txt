Management emphasizes that our cash generated from operations continues to be a significant source of funds for investing in growth, including acquisitions and strategic alliances, managing contingencies and reducing debt levels, and that our investment-grade credit profile reflects the size and diversity of our product portfolio, leading share positions in several served markets, strong cash flow, solid financial fundamentals and disciplined financial strategy.  We invest excess cash on hand in short-term financial instruments that earn market interest rates while mitigating principal risk through instrument and counterparty diversification and prudent instrument selection, limiting direct exposure to any single industry or issuer, and we maintain access to a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, term loans, a trade receivables securitization facility and other credit arrangements to fund operations, infrastructure investments, legal liabilities, taxes, mergers and acquisitions and debt service, subject to compliance with financial covenants.  As part of our strategic imperatives to drive global expansion, we have increased investment in infrastructure in emerging markets to grow net sales and market share by strengthening local relationships and expanding our presence, and we manage market risk from foreign currency exchange rate changes at the corporate level by reviewing constant-currency revenue growth to facilitate evaluation of current operating performance and comparison to past performance.  Our targeted initiatives focused on reducing selling, general and administrative expenses and the suspension of the medical device excise tax enabled reinvestment into strategic growth initiatives, while our ongoing restructuring and other process improvement programs have driven manufacturing cost reductions and are expected to yield gross annual expense savings of $115 million to $150 million by the end of 2020 as these programs are realized.  We remain committed to advancing medical technologies through meaningful research and development investments across all of our businesses to maintain a healthy pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growth, and we integrate acquired manufacturing assets and biologic tissue capabilities to strengthen our product platforms and future heart valve technologies.  We continue to assess litigation and product liability exposures and uncertain tax positions, accruing anticipated settlement costs, entering into a stipulation with the IRS to resolve transfer pricing issues and planning net tax payments of approximately $275 million plus interest, while acknowledging that final resolution is contingent and could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  We base our estimates for sales returns, excess or obsolete inventory and impairment of intangible assets and goodwill on historical trends, forecasted net sales, discounted cash flow models and risk-adjusted discount rates, and we re-measure contingent consideration liabilities at fair value each period, reflecting a disciplined approach to risk assessment and resource allocation.  Our internal control processes, designed and maintained in accordance with COSO criteria, provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, and the use of supplemental non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share and adjusted net sales excluding divested businesses and foreign currency impacts provides transparency in evaluating operating performance and facilitating comparisons to past operating results.

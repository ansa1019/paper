Marsh & McLennan Companies emphasizes its capacity to maintain operational continuity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions by deploying diversified risk mitigation and resource reconfiguration strategies across its global professional services platform. Through its risk and insurance services segment, the company acts as broker, agent and consultant to advise clients on risk transfer, control and mitigation solutions, absorbs fluctuations in premium rate levels and foreign exchange headwinds by isolating underlying revenue growth, and integrates acquisitions to sustain performance under external pressures. In its consulting segment, restructurings such as the merger of Mercer's investment and retirement businesses and modifications to U.S. and U.K. defined benefit pension plans—closing plans to future accruals and instituting enhanced defined contribution arrangements—demonstrate the firm’s systematic reconfiguration of financial and human capital to preserve functioning and adapt to evolving regulatory and market environments. The company manages liquidity and financial resilience through a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility subject to covenant testing, strategic issuances of senior notes to fund general corporate purposes, disciplined working capital management that generated $2.0 billion of operating cash flow in 2016, and a board-authorized share repurchase program of up to $2.5 billion. It employs case-level legal and actuarial analyses to estimate and reserve for probable loss contingencies, regularly reviews liabilities to support recovery from potential errors or violations, and adjusts operating expenses—such as the termination of its post-65 retiree medical reimbursement plan and control of base salary, bonus and benefit costs—to preserve or improve performance despite adversity. By aligning strategic initiatives with rigorous risk assessment, resource allocation and financial flexibility, the company reconstitutes its organizational trajectories in immediate response to disruptions and reconfigures toward sustained future strength.

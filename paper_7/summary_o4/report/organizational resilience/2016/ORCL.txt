Oracle’s management describes a fully integrated stack of cloud and on-premise software, platform and infrastructure services that is engineered to be rapidly deployable, easily maintainable, connectable, compatible and cost-effective—features that support customers’ operational continuity, flexibility and risk mitigation in both nominal and disruptive conditions.  The company emphasizes virtualization, clustering and large-scale systems management to enable efficient deployment, management and maintenance of IT environments, and it designs its engineered systems to simplify maintenance cycles, ensure high availability, and deliver improved performance and security relative to competitor offerings.  Oracle’s hybrid IT model further enhances adaptability by allowing customers to allocate and manage resources dynamically across cloud and on-premise environments as a single system, providing agility and interchangeability of workloads.  Investments in research and development, together with a selective acquisition program, are intended to expand product and service portfolios, accelerate innovation, and build scale—thereby strengthening the organization’s capacity to absorb change, reconfigure its offerings and emerge stronger from challenging situations.  Standardization of components, a build-to-order manufacturing process and flexible deployment options underpin the company’s ability to preserve performance and meet evolving customer needs under varying pressures, while comprehensive support services with high renewal rates contribute to business continuity, risk management and partial maintenance of integrity and performance.

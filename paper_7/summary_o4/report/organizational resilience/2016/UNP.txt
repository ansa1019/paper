Throughout 2016 and into our 2017 outlook, we continued to embed practices and resource-allocation strategies that reflect scholars’ notion of “maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions,” evidenced by achieving our best ever reportable personal injury incident rate of 0.75 per 200,000 employee-hours and a 3% improvement in derailment rates through a multi-faceted approach to safety—including technology deployment, risk assessment, training, employee engagement, total safety culture and UP Way continuous improvement programs—that leverages internal knowledge, mitigates hazards and preserves operational integrity under varying pressures; despite a 7% decline in carloads and second-lowest volume levels since 1998, we delivered our third-best earnings performance with net income of $4.2 billion, driven by core pricing gains, productivity initiatives and efficient, fluid network operations that increased average train speed 5% and decreased terminal dwell time 4%, demonstrating adaptive resource alignment, operational flexibility and surge capability; our capital plan of approximately $3.1 billion—65% to 75% allocated to renewing and improving existing track infrastructure, technology such as PTC, and commercial assets—illustrates dynamic capability to reconfigure assets and respond to environmental disruptions and evolving market conditions for long-term growth; liquidity and capital resources strategies—including a $1.7 billion revolving credit facility, a $650 million receivables securitization facility, access to commercial paper and disciplined free cash flow management—underscore business continuity planning and resilience to financial volatility; governance of debt-to-capital metrics, adjusted debt-to-capital analyses and sensitivity testing of interest-rate and inflation scenarios reflect proactive risk mitigation and capital structure management; accruals based on actuarial analyses for personal injury, asbestos claims and environmental remediation reinforce organizational health and crisis readiness; and disclosures of critical accounting policies and forward-looking statements outline our assumptions, contingency planning and capacity to adapt strategic tools, models and resource configurations to maintain performance and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

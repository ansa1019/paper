We have established a comprehensive risk framework and governance structure to ensure the organization’s capacity to maintain performance under stress, including a formally approved risk appetite statement, clearly defined roles and accountability across our board, management committees and front-line units, and independent risk management and audit functions to identify, measure, monitor and control credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, reputational and strategic risks.  A strong risk culture is mandated throughout our lines of business and support functions, with ongoing risk and control self-assessments, key risk indicators, stress testing and contingency planning—covering capital, liquidity, recovery and enterprise resiliency—to anticipate and respond rapidly to adverse scenarios.  We maintain excess liquidity in cash and high-quality unencumbered securities, diversified funding globally, and “time-to-required-funding” analysis, liquidity stress analyses and contingency funding plans to preserve operational continuity under stressed market conditions.  Interest rate and foreign-exchange exposures on both trading and non-trading balance-sheet portfolios are managed via asset-liability management activities, including derivatives hedges, to limit volatility in net interest income and capital.  We hedge servicing and mortgage commitment risks using mortgage securities, forwards, futures, options and swaps to stabilize earnings and preserve servicing capacity.  Organizational continuity is further supported by centralized funding strategies, delegated credit limits, and periodic model validation and back-testing of value-at-risk and stress scenarios, as well as independent reviews of compliance, operational controls and capital planning, all of which underpin our ongoing ability to absorb strain and maintain functioning despite challenging economic, regulatory and operational conditions.

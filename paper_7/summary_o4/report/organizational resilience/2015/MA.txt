In the Management’s Discussion and Analysis, Mastercard emphasizes the role of geographic and structural diversification and proactive monitoring of political and economic conditions to protect operating results from adverse economic trends in individual markets, thereby supporting business continuity and adaptability under challenging conditions. The company monitors significant one-time items separately from ongoing operations and excludes them from non-GAAP performance measures to better reflect core operational flexibility and support performance maintenance and resilience strategies. Recognizing heightened information security risks, Mastercard has implemented security services, standards development and risk-mitigation measures to safeguard transaction integrity, acknowledging potential impacts and preparing for crisis response despite no material breaches to date. To manage foreign-currency volatility and its impact on revenue translation and transaction volumes, the company employs foreign-exchange risk-management activities, including derivatives, and regularly evaluates exposures. Mastercard guarantees settlement of branded transactions between issuers and acquirers, a systemic risk-management mechanism supported by substantial liquidity resources. In October 2015, Mastercard established a $3.75 billion revolving credit facility and a $3.75 billion commercial paper program, and in December 2015 issued €1.65 billion of senior unsecured notes, enhancing its capital resources to fund general corporate purposes and ensure settlement capabilities under extreme conditions. The company reviews and accrues for pending legal and regulatory proceedings where losses are probable and estimable, maintains unrecognized tax-benefit liabilities pending examination outcomes, and periodically adjusts valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on projected taxable income. Through ongoing acquisitions, investments in data analytics, expense-control initiatives and strategic capital allocation—including dividends and share repurchases determined by the Board based on operational needs—Mastercard seeks to absorb strain, preserve and improve functioning, and transform itself to emerge stronger from disruptive change.

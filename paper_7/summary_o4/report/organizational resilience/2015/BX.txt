Blackstone’s management discussion underscores the firm’s maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions by noting that “global equity indices were marked by high volatility during 2015, with the CBOE volatility index reaching its highest levels since 2011,” and that “concerns about global growth prospects, liquidity, energy exposure and uncertainty on interest rates also weighed on credit markets,” reflecting the external pressures and environmental turbulence the firm must absorb. In response, Blackstone emphasizes “multiple sources of liquidity to meet our capital needs, including annual cash flows, accumulated earnings in the businesses, investments in our own treasury and liquid funds and access to our debt capacity, including our $1.1 billion committed revolving credit facility and the proceeds from our… issuances of senior notes,” alongside disciplined expense management and proactive “operating metrics” such as assets under management, fee‐earning assets, dry powder and limited partner capital invested, which guide resource allocation, risk assessment and readiness for unexpected situations. The firm further details its use of strategic leverage “opportunistically… to create the most efficient capital structure,” the adoption of performance and liquidity covenants, a unit repurchase program and flexible distribution policies as mechanisms to preserve business continuity, operational flexibility and competitive advantage, thereby reinforcing the organization’s ability to adapt, recover and sustain performance under internal or external variations and disturbances.

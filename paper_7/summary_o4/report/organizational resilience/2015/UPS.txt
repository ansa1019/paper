In response to uneven global and domestic economic growth and challenging conditions such as weak export demand, commodity-price volatility and adverse weather, the company continued to adjust its air capacity and cost structure across its transportation network while leveraging a broad portfolio of product offerings and the inherent flexibilities in its network to adapt to changing volume trends. It has undertaken initiatives domestically and internationally to improve the flexibility and capacity of its transportation network, enhance yield management, increase operational efficiency and contain costs, deploying technology improvements—including facility automation projects and the accelerated roll-out of its on-road integrated optimization and navigation system—to increase network capacity, efficiency, flexibility and reliability, and by utilizing newly expanded operating facilities to improve time-in-transit. These network efficiency and productivity improvements have yielded reductions in adjusted cost per piece, achieved through aligning air and ground networks with prevailing volume levels and containing vehicle miles driven despite rising package volume. Internationally, disciplined yield and growth initiatives, adjustments to fuel surcharge indices and periodic base-rate increases have been employed to maintain performance under currency fluctuations, declining fuel prices and slower market conditions while optimizing aircraft block hours. In its supply chain and freight operations, the company balanced forwarding and logistics volume with purchased-transportation costs, applied disciplined revenue management in air and ocean forwarding and less-than-truckload tonnage, and implemented base-rate increases, resulting in improved or stable margins. Overall, these practices reflect an adaptive approach to resource allocation, operational continuity and partial maintenance of integrity and performance under external pressures, thereby supporting organizational resilience as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

Union Pacific’s 2015 management’s discussion illustrates its ability to absorb strain and sustain performance through integrated safety, operational and financial measures. The railroad continued its focus on safety to reduce risk and eliminate incidents, achieving a record low 0.87 reportable personal injury incidents per 200,000 employee-hours and a 3% improvement in crossing incident rates, demonstrating workforce engagement via Courage to Care, Total Safety Culture and its Up Way continuous improvement culture. Despite a 6% decrease in carloads, core pricing gains of 3.7%, productivity initiatives and improved network operations—reflected in a 6% increase in average train speed and a 3% reduction in terminal dwell time—partially offset lower volumes and produced second-best operating income of $8.1 billion and a record-low 63.1% operating ratio. In 2016, resources will continue to be aligned with customer demand to improve network performance and maintain surge capability, supported by a $3.75 billion capital plan that allocates 55%–60% of investments to renew and improve existing assets, expand capacity and terminals, install Positive Train Control and acquire locomotives and freight cars. Free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operating activities less investing activities and dividends, is emphasized as a measure of the ability to generate cash without external financing, while liquidity is secured through a $650 million receivables securitization facility, a $1.7 billion revolving credit facility, commercial paper and bond issuances to mitigate funding disruptions. The company also employs derivatives to hedge interest rate and fuel price volatility, conducts depreciation studies to manage asset lives and costs, forecasts labor to match volume fluctuations, and monitors debt-to-capital ratios to balance leverage and market access, collectively reinforcing its operational flexibility, risk mitigation and long-term strategic resilience.

In its forward‐looking statements the firm highlights the objectives and effectiveness of its business continuity plan, information security program, risk management and liquidity policies as central to its ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.  The firm’s quarterly balance sheet planning process, which includes asset and liability limits, scenario analyses and monitoring of key metrics, dynamically allocates resources and adjusts funding sources in response to changing business activity levels, market fluctuations and regulatory requirements.  A comprehensive contingency funding plan, supported by stress testing over both intraday and 30-day horizons, identifies potential cash and collateral outflows under firm-specific and market-wide stress scenarios, assigns clear decision-making roles and delineates crisis communication protocols, thereby preserving operational continuity.  Liquidity risk management principles—holding pre-funded global core liquid assets, maintaining diversified secured and unsecured financing with staggered maturities, and active asset-liability management—are designed to withstand extreme conditions without resorting to asset sales.  Capital planning and stress testing under CCAR and DFAST project sources and uses of capital across severe scenarios, shaping limits on balance sheet size, risk exposures and capital distributions to ensure the firm remains adequately capitalized and can reconfigure trajectories in response to disruptions.  Firmwide and divisional risk committees, together with independent control and support functions—including market risk management, credit risk management, operational risk management and model risk management—use a suite of measures (value-at-risk, sensitivity analysis, scenario tests and backtesting) to identify, monitor and mitigate exposures to market, credit, operational and model risks, reinforcing the system’s integrity, supporting rapid reconfiguration and enabling recovery and growth despite internal or external perturbations.

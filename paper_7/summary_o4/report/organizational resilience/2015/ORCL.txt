Oracle’s cloud offerings are designed to be rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to innovation; easily maintainable to reduce integration and testing work; and cost-effective by requiring lower upfront customer investment, and they integrate the software, hardware and services on the customers’ behalf in IT environments that Oracle deploys, supports and manages. Oracle has a deep understanding of how all components within IT environments—application, platform and infrastructure—interact and function with one another, and focuses development efforts on improving performance, operation and integration of these differing technologies to make them more cost-effective and easier to deploy, manage and maintain for customers, thereby enhancing operational continuity and reducing risk. Oracle engineers its products and services to best connect cloud and on-premises deployment models to enable flexibility, ease, agility, compatibility, extensibility and seamlessness, and its hardware systems products, including Oracle Engineered Systems, are pre-integrated products that bring multiple technology components together to deliver improved performance, availability, security and operational efficiency, are tested before shipment and delivered ready-to-run, enabling customers to shorten the time to production and better withstand internal and external variations. Oracle also embeds virtualization and management capabilities in its hardware systems to enable rapid deployment and efficient management of cloud and on-premises IT infrastructures and designs hardware products to seamlessly connect these environments, further enabling interoperability, interchangeability and extendibility. By offering customers a choice of deployment models and enabling them to evolve and transform at whatever pace is most appropriate, and by continuing significant investments in research and development along with a selective acquisition program to provide greater scale, accelerate innovation and expand service capabilities, Oracle strengthens its capacity to respond effectively to disruptions and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions.

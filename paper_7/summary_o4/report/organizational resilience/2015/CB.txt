Chubb maintains a substantial liquidity buffer comprising cash balances, highly liquid investments, diversified fixed-income portfolios, credit facilities and repurchase agreements that are duration-matched against its long-tail insurance liabilities to ensure business continuity and operational flexibility under internal or external perturbations. It pursues proactive risk mitigation and adaptation strategies through global catastrophe accumulation monitoring and modeling of probable maximum losses, the purchase of multi-layered property catastrophe reinsurance programs with structured claim limits and reinstatement features, and the use of derivatives and crop hedges to transfer insurance, credit and market risks. To preserve system integrity and performance under exceptional conditions, management employs rigorous reserving and stress-testing processes—including routine analytical reviews, actuarial central estimates, dynamic adjustments of loss trends and development patterns, and collateral management protocols for reinsurance recoverables—thereby safeguarding financial resources against variations in loss emergence. Liquidity management is further supported by international notional cash-pooling arrangements, multi-currency letters of credit and a $1.5 billion unsecured operational facility that preserve resource generation and emergency funding capacity. Capital resource strategies include diversified access to debt and equity markets via an unlimited shelf registration, targeted share repurchases and disciplined dividend management subject to regulatory and rating agency constraints, reinforcing organizational health and resilience. Additionally, structured underwriting controls—such as co-insurance, deductibles, waiting periods and policy-level reinsurance limits in its political risk, trade credit and variable-annuity guarantee portfolios—function as mechanisms to contain exposures, reconfigure risk profiles and maintain positive adjustment and continuity in the face of challenging conditions.

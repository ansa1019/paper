During fiscal 2015, in response to a significant payment data breach, the company completed a major payment security project providing enhanced encryption of card data at point of sale across U.S. and Canadian stores, rolled out EMV chip card technology in U.S. stores, recorded accruals for estimated probable losses related to claims by payment card networks and consolidated customer class actions, and maintained network security and privacy liability insurance coverage of $100 million above its deductible to limit exposure. The company has recorded pretax expenses to investigate the breach, provide identity protection services, increase call‐center staffing and retain professional services, continues to evaluate developments and will record further loss estimates when both probable and reasonably estimable, and cooperates with governmental investigations. Operational resilience was advanced through continuous improvement in stores and the supply chain via disciplined capital allocation and initiatives such as Project Sync, which targets reduced supplier‐to‐shelf lead times, lower transportation costs and improved inventory turns, and through a customer experience initiative that retrained associates on a customer‐first program and deployed web‐enabled handheld devices to convert online sales in-aisle and expedite checkout during peak periods. The product authority initiative leveraged merchandising transformation, portfolio strategy and assortment planning tools to deliver innovation, tailored product assortments and value. Under its interconnecting retail strategy, the company piloted and plans to roll out an omnichannel platform across all U.S. stores, opened a third digital fulfillment center to reach 90 percent of customers in two days or less, implemented BOSS via RDC delivery and began rolling out BODFS, enhanced mobile and digital content to simplify the online experience, increased site traffic and conversion rates, and achieved over 40 percent of online orders picked up in stores as online sales grew 25.4 percent. From a financial resilience perspective, the company believes its cash position, access to long-term debt markets, strong operating cash flow, commercial paper programs and a $2.0 billion back-up credit facility provide sufficient liquidity to fund operations, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and debt maturities over the next several years, while managing interest rate risk through forward-starting and fair-value swap agreements. The company also maintains self-insured retentions for general liability, workers’ compensation, medical and automobile claims based on historical and actuarial estimates; accrues vendor allowances based on expected purchase volumes; evaluates long-lived assets quarterly for impairment by comparing undiscounted cash flows to carrying values; and performs annual goodwill recoverability assessments, concluding that reporting unit fair values exceed carrying values, thereby preserving system integrity and performance under internal or external disturbances.

Management continues to implement strategic initiatives to provide integrated technology and services solutions that enable best-in-class results for clients, including active portfolio management, enhancing client relationships, improving operational effectiveness, disciplined allocation of capital and differentiating products and services through innovation. Our key enterprise priorities emphasize building high-quality recurring revenue, enhancing digital and payment solutions and delivering innovation and integration. Faced with regulatory pressures and rapidly evolving payment, deposit, lending, investment and risk management products, financial institutions have increased their investments of capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information and offer innovative new services in a competitive, evolving marketplace. We expect to benefit from the trend toward outsourcing in-house technology as clients seek to remain current on technology changes and we believe economies of scale in developing and maintaining infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks are essential to support these investments. Our focus on long-term client relationships and recurring, transaction-oriented products and services has reduced the impact of industry consolidation. Cost of processing and services benefited from increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses and company-wide operational efficiency initiatives, while operating income and operating margin improvements in 2015 and 2014 were driven by scale efficiencies, expense discipline and operational effectiveness initiatives, along with lower merger and integration expenses. Incremental investments to consolidate data centers and real estate and to expand capacity in our biller and output solutions businesses reflect our ongoing resource reallocation to support operational continuity. Liquidity needs—including funding normal operating expenses, servicing indebtedness, capital expenditures and potential acquisitions—are expected to be satisfied through operating cash flow, cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under an amended revolving credit facility, which was restated in April 2015 to extend maturity, revise borrowing terms and release subsidiary guarantors, subject to covenants limiting consolidated indebtedness and requiring earnings coverage. In May 2015, we completed a $1.75 billion offering of senior notes, used the proceeds to redeem maturing notes and make scheduled term loan payments, recorded a pre-tax loss on early debt extinguishment and deployed remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes. Our corporate credit ratings of Baa2 from Moody’s and BBB from S&P support our access to capital markets, with interest rates subject to adjustment if our ratings change.

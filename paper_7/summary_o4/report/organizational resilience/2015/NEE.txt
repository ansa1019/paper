In the Management’s Discussion and Analysis, the company describes its reliance on robust liquidity and credit facilities—approximately $7.7 billion in net available liquidity at year-end—to support business continuity and absorb volatility in operating cash flows, noting that failure to maintain investment-grade credit ratings could require collateral postings under energy trading and power purchase agreements. The return-focused regulatory framework permits targeted reserve amortizations and periodic reviews of decommissioning and dismantlement liabilities, while multi-year capital programs to modernize the Port Everglades plant, replace gas turbines, build solar PV projects and integrate over 1,200 MW of wind and 285 MW of solar capacity illustrate resource reconfiguration, operational flexibility and adaptation to environmental and market disruptions. The use of derivative instruments and a value-at-risk model to hedge commodity, interest-rate and foreign-exchange exposures, alongside letters of credit, surety bonds and indemnities, reflects a systemic risk-mitigation strategy to preserve performance under pressure. Strategic equity issuances, shelf registration for securities and partnership alignments—including the acquisition of Texas pipeline assets, the formation of renewable project subsidiaries and programs to repurchase partner interests—underscore a future-oriented approach to resource allocation, organizational change processes and growth. Financial and accounting policies—such as pension plan funding assumptions, impairment reviews of long-lived assets and recognition of regulatory assets and liabilities—are governed by detailed controls and scenario analyses designed to maintain integrity and performance amid internal variations and external perturbations, consistent with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

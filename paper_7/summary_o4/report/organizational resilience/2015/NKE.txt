Management continues to drive operational excellence across key areas by delivering innovative premium products that command higher prices, reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency, product design and innovation, and making the supply chain a competitive advantage via investments in automation technologies that reduce waste, increase customization and accelerate speed to market. The company optimizes selling and administrative expense by focusing on investments in consumer engagement to drive incremental revenue and gross profit, infrastructure investments that improve operational efficiency and productivity of legacy systems, while also improving working capital efficiency and deploying capital effectively. Despite significant foreign currency headwinds and ongoing volatility in currency markets, fiscal 2015 results demonstrated the organization’s ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, delivering record revenues, expanded gross margins and increased earnings before interest and taxes, which more than offset higher operating expenses. A centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program addresses transactional and translational exposures on a portfolio basis by leveraging natural offsets and currency correlations and, where practical, hedging probable future cash flows—including non-functional currency product purchases and sales—through forward contracts and options, without engaging in speculative trading. Investments in U.S.-dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities at foreign subsidiaries, hedged through forward contracts, partially offset translation effects on consolidated earnings, preserving financial integrity when internal or external variations occur. Cash provided by operations, together with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $5.9 billion, undrawn committed credit facilities, and a commercial paper program, underpins business continuity and meets domestic and foreign capital needs without undue reliance on external markets. Continued investments in property, plant and equipment to support direct-to-consumer store expansion, digital capabilities and supply chain initiatives enhance adaptability to unexpected supply disruptions—such as west coast port congestion—and higher input costs, ensuring operational continuity. Credit ratings, compliance with debt covenants and strategic credit facility use bolster financial flexibility. Systematic risk assessment of foreign exchange, interest rate and working capital exposures, combined with rigorous hedging strategies, targeted resource allocation and infrastructure enhancements, enable the organization to absorb strain, preserve functioning under constraints and maintain performance while positioning for future, sustainable growth.

ADP’s management acknowledges that its forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including security or privacy breaches, fraudulent acts, and system interruptions and failures, and disclaims any obligation to update such statements. The company embraces new technology and innovation to deliver exceptional products and services that help clients manage and build better workforces, with a business strategy predicated on strategic pillars—growing a complete suite of cloud-based HCM solutions, investing to scale HR business process outsourcing, and leveraging its global presence—underpinned by service excellence, talent management, and deep expertise. Strategic reconfiguration is demonstrated by the separation of its former dealer services business into CDK Global and by increased investments in product innovation and its salesforce, enabling adaptability to complex market demands such as ACA compliance. Despite pressures from foreign currency translation, margin pressure on client funds interest, declining interest rates, and elevated selling expenses, ADP achieved solid organic revenue growth, pretax margin expansion, record client revenue retention, and increased pays per control, reflecting operational flexibility and performance maintenance under external disturbances. Prudently managing client funds under conservative investment guidelines that prioritize safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification, ADP structures its investment portfolio by laddering maturities through five- and ten-year horizons and supports this through short-term financing arrangements—including a commercial paper program rated A-1+/P-1, reverse repurchase agreements, and committed revolving credit facilities totaling $8.25 billion—providing business continuity without forced liquidation of invested assets. The company’s strong operating cash flows, high recurring revenues, robust margins, low capital expenditures, and strict credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for investments further underpin its liquidity management and risk mitigation framework, maintaining system integrity and supporting resource reconfiguration to adapt to varying environmental and market perturbations. These strategies reflect a multifaceted approach to foresee, confront, and benefit from disruptive change, enabling ADP to maintain integrity and performance while adapting to internal or external pressures.

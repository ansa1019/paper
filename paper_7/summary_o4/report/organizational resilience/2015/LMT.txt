In an environment of increasing global security complexity, continuing economic pressures and constrained government funding, the company pursues program execution improvements, quality enhancements and predictable delivery to maintain operational continuity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions. It invests in technologies and in personnel to build internal knowledge and skills while preserving free cash flow, and it continuously shapes its portfolio through independent research and development, selective acquisitions (such as Sikorsky), divestitures (including Information Systems & Global Solutions) and program realignments to reconfigure resources toward core capabilities, adjacent markets and international opportunities, thereby enhancing strategic resilience and adaptability. The firm actively assesses and adjusts assumptions related to production schedules, contract funding, budget control acts and sequestration to mitigate risk, sustain service innovation and preserve performance under pressure. Workforce realignments based on future workload projections and a diversified funding strategy—including access to revolving credit facilities, commercial paper, opportunistic long-term debt issuances and anticipated divestiture proceeds—ensure liquidity, risk mitigation and business continuity. Concurrent development and production on complex programs like the F-35 accelerates the fielding of critical systems while containing cost variability. International expansion through partnerships, local production joint technology offices and foreign military sales further reduces dependency on any single market and reinforces organizational flexibility. Environmental remediation liabilities and postretirement benefit funding strategies, including CAS harmonization and prepayment credits, reflect proactive risk management, resource planning and recovery mechanisms. A balanced approach to capital expenditures for facilities, equipment and information technology alongside dividends and share repurchases preserves financial resources and supports the organization’s capacity to absorb strain, reconstitute operations and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity.

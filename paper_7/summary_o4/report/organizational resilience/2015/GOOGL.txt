In the fourth quarter of 2015, we implemented legal and operational changes in how our chief operating decision maker manages our businesses, including resource allocation and performance assessment, and established multiple operating segments to enable greater operational flexibility and performance maintenance under evolving conditions. As online advertising evolves and users increasingly embrace multi-device and international usage, we continue to expand our product offerings to serve changing user and advertiser needs, seek to expand our products and services to stay in front of these shifts in order to maintain and grow our business, and develop localized versions of our products and relevant advertising programs for emerging markets. To mitigate external pressures from foreign exchange volatility, we maintain a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations and present results on a constant currency basis, defined as total revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging gains. We derive an increasing portion of our revenues from non-advertising sources such as Google Play, cloud and apps, and hardware products, and we expect this diversification to continue. We invest heavily in research and development in areas of strategic focus for Google and other bets, and our capital expenditures fluctuate in line with investments in systems, data centers, real estate and IT infrastructure; acquisitions remain an important part of our strategy and use of capital, enhancing the breadth and depth of our offerings and expanding our engineering expertise. Our employees—61,814 full-time as of December 31, 2015—are critical assets; we expect to continue hiring talented employees and to provide competitive compensation programs to support organizational health and resilience. With $73.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, complemented by cash flow from operations and debt financing programs including commercial paper and revolving credit facilities, we believe our liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. Our primary uses of cash include payments to network members and distribution partners, content acquisition costs, capital investments and employee-related expenditures, and we record and periodically reassess liabilities for contingencies, goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment, and apply significant judgment in evaluating uncertain tax positions under continuous examination, all to ensure the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity.

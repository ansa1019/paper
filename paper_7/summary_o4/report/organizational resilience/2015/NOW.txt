The Company’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis describes a systemic approach to maintaining organizational integrity and performance under internal and external variations by “investing in the development of our services, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth,” expanding data center capacity and leveraging cloud-based hardware to absorb increased demand and improve economies of scale. Subscription renewal rates of 98%, 97% and 96% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, are highlighted as indicators of continuity in revenue streams under evolving market conditions, while the build-out of a scalable pricing model, the expansion of an internal professional services organization and a partner ecosystem ensure service delivery resilience. The Company also discloses the “unfavorable impact” of the strengthening U.S. dollar on billings and revenues, uses constant-currency measures and evaluates hedging strategies to manage currency risk, and emphasizes that its principal sources of liquidity—$801 million in cash and cash equivalents, $423 million in long-term investments and $227.6 million of free cash flow in 2015—are sufficient to meet its operating, capital and contractual commitments, which include data center and office leases, convertible senior notes and deferred commission liabilities, thereby demonstrating resilience through proactive resource allocation, risk mitigation and performance maintenance across nominal and exceptional conditions.

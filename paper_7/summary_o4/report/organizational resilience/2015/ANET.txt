This discussion contains forward-looking statements “based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties” and cautions that “our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated,” including the risk that “if we are unable to address these challenges, our business could be adversely affected.”  The company “expects to continue rapidly growing our organization to meet the needs of new and existing customers” and “intends to continue investing for long-term growth,” accelerating “investment in infrastructure, such as enterprise resource planning software and other technologies to improve the efficiency of our operations,” expanding “our research and development organization to enhance the functionality of our existing cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership,” and broadening “our sales and marketing teams and programs” as well as “our network of channel partners to enable them to reach new end customers more effectively, increase sales to existing customers and provide services and support effectively.”  It acknowledges that “our future capital requirements will depend on many factors” and that, if it “requires or elects to seek additional capital through debt or equity financing in the future, we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all,” which could in turn “adversely affect” its ability to maintain operating continuity and pursue strategic initiatives.  The company further affirms that “we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and our growth strategies for the foreseeable future,” while it “records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated” and “regularly assess[es] the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be realized” and maintain[s] valuation allowances where realization is not more likely than not.  Its policies for deferring post-contract support revenue and recognizing related expenses ratably over the contract term, matching provisioning for warranty and inventory obsolescence to historical experience and demand forecasts, and allocating consideration in multiple-element arrangements based on best estimates of standalone selling price illustrate a systematic approach to resource allocation, risk mitigation, and preservation of performance under variable market, operational and financial conditions.

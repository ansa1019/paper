Amgen’s transformation and process improvement efforts, announced in 2014, include a restructuring that reduced the company’s geographic footprint and staff by 3,500 to 4,000, enabling it to reallocate resources to fund strategic R&D, new product launches and growth opportunities, drive manufacturing efficiencies, lower operating costs and improve its focused operating model. These initiatives supported capital expenditure expansions—primarily manufacturing capacity in Singapore, Puerto Rico and Ireland—and process improvements that have contributed to improved operating margins, a 6% increase in cash flows from operating activities to $9.1 billion and the ability to invest for the future amid competitive, economic and regulatory pressures. Amgen’s risk mitigation strategies encompass foreign currency hedging to offset exchange rate impacts, maintenance of prudent liquidity through diversified sources—cash from operations, marketable securities, commercial paper and a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility—and disciplined investment policies limiting exposure to acceptable levels of risk. The company continues returning capital to shareholders via dividends and $1.9 billion in share repurchases, reflecting resilience in financial flexibility, and remains focused on adaptation to pricing pressures, healthcare cost containment initiatives and evolving market demands through collaborative development programs, strategic alliances and ongoing resource reconfiguration to preserve and enhance performance under challenging conditions.

Microsoft’s fiscal 2015 MD&A describes organizational initiatives designed to enable resilience in the face of dynamic industry shifts and external pressures, including extensive product and platform transformations, strategic and tactical reconfigurations, investments in cloud infrastructure and new growth categories, integration and restructuring activities to realign resources following the acquisition of Nokia’s devices and services business, and implementation of the Windows Insider program to incorporate unprecedented levels of user and developer feedback into iterative development. The company acknowledges a highly competitive, dynamic business environment requiring continuous evolution and adaptation, proactive risk management via derivative instruments to mitigate foreign currency, equity price, interest rate and credit exposures, and maintenance of liquidity through diversified, investment-grade fixed-income portfolios. Impairment and restructuring charges of $10.0 billion reflect goodwill and intangible asset write-downs related to the phone hardware business, employee severance and facility consolidation costs, and ongoing integration expenses, while research and development investments increased to support new products and services, illustrating the firm’s absorptive capacity and resource redeployment under challenging conditions. Microsoft further details robust cash management and capital preservation strategies to sustain operations and strategic flexibility domestically and abroad, foresees sufficient ongoing cash flows to fund operating, investing, and financing commitments in both nominal and stressed scenarios, and retains the ability to repatriate earnings or raise capital to preserve organizational health and uphold performance amid market and currency variability.

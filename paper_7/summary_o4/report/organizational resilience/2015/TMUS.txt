The Company’s ongoing un-carrier initiatives and network improvements, including having “substantially completed the process of upgrading our network to LTE” and “building out our network to utilize our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum licenses,” reflect strategic adaptation to customer needs and external competitive pressures and preserve operational continuity through substantial investments in the business. Synergies realized from “decommissioning of the MetroPCS CDMA network and certain other redundant network cell sites,” combined with disciplined resource allocation across operating leases, capital leases and spectrum license acquisitions, have lowered service costs and enabled focused network expansion. The introduction of “Jump! On Demand,” which shifts device costs from immediate equipment sales to capitalization and depreciation over the lease term, and an arrangement “to sell certain EIP accounts receivable on a revolving basis,” enhance financial flexibility and liquidity management. The Company’s principal sources of liquidity—cash generated from operations, existing revolving credit facilities and opportunistic issuance of long-term debt—support ongoing spectrum license auctions and network modernization without adversely affecting credit ratings, while restrictive covenants “limit our ability to incur more debt” yet currently remain in compliance. Capital expenditure budgeting of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion in 2016 for property, equipment and spectrum licenses and regular reviews of financial projections underpin preparedness for environmental disruptions. Contractual commitments—including long-term debt maturities, interest obligations, tower and operating leases, purchase obligations and network decommissioning costs—are transparently disclosed to facilitate risk assessment and resource reconfiguration, thereby underpinning the Company’s capacity to maintain service integrity, adapt to market turbulence and sustain performance under challenging conditions.

Our security platform empowers enterprises, service providers, and government entities to maintain operational continuity by safely enabling a growing number of applications, preventing breaches in real time that stem from targeted cyber attacks, and providing in-depth visibility into all traffic and all applications, at the user level, at all times, and at the full speed of the network in order to control usage, content, risks, and cyber threats.

Management monitors key financial metrics—deferred revenue, cash flow provided by operating activities, free cash flow, and billings—to evaluate performance trends, allocate resources efficiently, and assess operational flexibility, while holding $1.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and investments to meet working capital needs under varying scenarios. To manage future growth effectively, the Company continues to improve and expand its information technology and financial infrastructure, its operating and administrative systems and controls, and its ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner, and believes its ability to extend technology leadership, grow and deepen deployment within its installed base, and focus on end-customer satisfaction is critical to sustaining business continuity and resilience. Contract manufacturer liabilities are accrued for excess component commitments based on demand forecasts to mitigate supply-chain risk, and loss contingencies are recorded when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability incurred and can be reasonably estimated. Long-lived assets, purchase price allocations, goodwill, and intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable, ensuring that financial reporting reflects the system’s integrity and performance potential. Critical accounting policies for revenue recognition, share-based compensation, income taxes, and uncertain tax positions rely on judgment and periodic reassessment to preserve organizational health in the face of environmental perturbations and unexpected changes.

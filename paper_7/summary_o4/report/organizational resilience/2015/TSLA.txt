We have enhanced our vehicle offerings with all-wheel drive capability, autopilot options, and free over-the-air software updates, while continuing to increase our sales and service footprint worldwide and expand our supercharging and destination charging networks, thereby reinforcing our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite market and operational adversity.  In August 2014, we began a significant production capacity increase at the Tesla Factory by transitioning to our new final assembly line and upgrading our body center, and these production capacity increases continued into 2015 with further investments including building a new paint shop, a new body shop for Model X, and additional stamping capacity, reflecting our systemic approach to resource deployment and operational flexibility.  To support long-term resilience and business continuity, we are developing the Gigafactory as a facility where we work together with our suppliers to integrate production of battery material, cells, modules, and packs in one location, and have entered into a partnership with Panasonic for production equipment to ensure stability of cell supply.  We plan to invest approximately $1.5 billion in capital expenditures in 2016 to fund equipment for cell production at the Gigafactory, begin installation of Model 3 production machinery, open new retail and service centers, and energize additional supercharger locations, thereby projecting temporal trajectories of organizational change and reconfiguring our operations toward future growth.  We manage financial and liquidity risks—including convertible note dilution, foreign currency exposures, and customer credit risk under resale value guarantees and direct leasing programs—through a senior secured revolving credit facility, hedging transactions, and careful provisioning of warranty reserves, inventory write-downs, and deferred tax valuation allowances, all of which contribute to our ability to maintain integrity and performance under internal or external variations and disturbances.

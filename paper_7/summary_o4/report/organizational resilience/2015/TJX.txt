Management reports that “we continued to generate strong cash flows, allowing us to return value to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, while continuing to reinvest in our business by adding new stores and remodeling existing ones, and while continuing to strengthen our infrastructure in support of our continuing growth,” initiatives which support positive adjustment under challenging conditions. In fiscal 2016, the first phase of an initiative to raise wages for our U.S. store associates was implemented, with a second phase scheduled for fiscal 2017, demonstrating targeted resource allocation to maintain organizational health. To mitigate external pressures from foreign currency fluctuations, “we routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases,” with mark-to-market adjustments offset upon receipt of inventory. The company states that existing cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and credit facilities “are more than adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year,” underscoring its preparedness and operational continuity. Capital expenditures of $889.4 million in fiscal 2016 for new stores, renovations and improvements and office and distribution centers reflected strategic investments in infrastructure to absorb strain and preserve functioning, with approximately $1.1 billion planned for fiscal 2017. The qualified pension plan received $50 million in voluntary contributions, and a self-insured casualty insurance program accrues estimated claims based on historical experience. Operating activities funded working capital primarily through operating cash flows, supplemented by short-term borrowings and commercial paper, and contractual obligations as of January 30, 2016 included long-term debt obligations of $2.089 billion, operating lease commitments of $7.998 billion and purchase obligations of $3.075 billion, reflecting structured resource commitments. Segment profit margins for fiscal 2016 were influenced by expense leverage on same store sales growth, merchandise margin improvements, the impact of higher payroll costs due to the wage initiative, investments in infrastructure and e-commerce activities, highlighting adaptive strategies to maintain performance under varying conditions. Shareholder return programs included the repurchase of 26.5 million shares for $1.8 billion under the 17th stock repurchase authorization and quarterly dividends totaling $0.84 per share, with a planned 24% increase in fiscal 2017. The consistent definition and classification of same store sales, use of constant currency translation and calculated average ticket and transaction metrics illustrate a systematic perspective and future orientation to manage environmental turbulence and sustain organizational effectiveness.

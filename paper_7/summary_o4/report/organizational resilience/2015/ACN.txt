The management discussion highlights that our results of operations are materially influenced by macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility and foreign currency fluctuations, which we monitor continuously and address through proactive cost management, global workforce planning and deployment, dynamic pricing and resource-mix adjustments, and currency-protection provisions and hedging programs to mitigate foreign exchange risk and preserve operating performance. We conduct rigorous contract governance, including pre-signing reviews of incentive arrangements, continuous reassessment of revenue and cost estimates under percentage-of-completion and fixed-price contracts, timely recognition of loss provisions when contract deficits become probable, and regular impairment testing of deferred transition costs, thereby enabling the organization to absorb strain and maintain service delivery under adverse conditions. We systematically measure utilization, recalibrate headcount and skill mix in lower-cost locations, adjust compensation strategies and resource allocation to balance customer needs and cost pressures, manage variable compensation accruals, and implement cost-management actions across sales, marketing and administrative functions to sustain margins in competitive markets. Complementing these operational measures, we maintain diversified credit facilities and liquidity reserves, apply dynamic cash-flow forecasting to fund working capital, share repurchases and investment needs, and employ structured tax planning and reserve practices to respond effectively to changing regulatory and financial circumstances, illustrating an integrated, systemic perspective on sustaining performance and organizational integrity amid internal and external disturbances.

Berkshire Hathaway’s operating model supports adaptive capacity through an “unusually decentralized” structure in which operating units carry minimal centralized functions and corporate headquarters limit day-to-day intervention, while senior management retains responsibility for “significant capital allocation decisions,” investment activities and corporate governance oversight, thus combining local responsiveness with strategic coherence.  In its insurance operations, management emphasizes the “maintenance of extraordinary capital strength”—with statutory surplus of approximately $124 billion at December 31, 2015—to absorb volatility arising from the “timing and amount of catastrophe losses,” negotiate customized reinsurance arrangements and implement premium rate increases as needed, recognizing that unpaid loss estimates “may develop upward or downward in future periods.”  The railroad segment demonstrated operational resilience in 2015 as “service levels” improved and “system velocity and on-time performance” rose following targeted capital investments in line expansion, system improvement projects and equipment additions, even as management “anticipates that volumes for these categories in 2016 may decline” if adverse conditions persist.  In utilities and energy, regulated rate structures subject to approval, the inclusion of newly-acquired businesses (AltaLink and NV Energy) and the capture of lower fuel and purchased power costs drove higher gross margins and earnings, reflecting strategic resource deployment and regulatory engagement to safeguard performance.  Consolidated liquidity and financial flexibility remain paramount; at year-end, insurance and other businesses held $61.2 billion in cash and $152.2 billion in investments, enabling the funding of $4.9 billion in acquisitions during 2015 and the subsequent $32 billion acquisition of Precision Castparts Corp. financed by a mix of cash and a $10 billion revolving credit facility.  A board-authorized share repurchase program, capped to preserve a minimum of $20 billion in cash, further exemplifies the company’s commitment to redundant liquidity and dynamic capital allocation as core resilience mechanisms.

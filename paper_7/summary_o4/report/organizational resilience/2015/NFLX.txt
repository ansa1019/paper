The company’s discussion of its rapid global expansion and focus on Netflix as a worldwide Internet TV network, including continuous launches in new territories and adjustments in pricing and plan mix with grandfathered memberships, exemplifies adaptive strategies and resource reconfiguration to absorb strain from foreign-currency fluctuations, market volatility and changing customer needs.  Its investments in original programming and licensing, reflected in $10.9 billion of streaming content obligations and multi-year production commitments, coupled with the build-out of its own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) and increased cloud-computing infrastructure, demonstrate systemic resilience, operational flexibility and service innovation designed to maintain integrity and performance under internal and external pressures.  The segmentation of contribution profit across domestic and international streaming, and its targets to grow contribution margins despite escalating content, delivery, marketing and headcount costs to support international expansion and exclusive programming, underscore the firm’s emphasis on performance maintenance, strategic agility and future orientation.  The issuance of $1.5 billion in long-term debt, the management of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to fund upfront content payments, the definition and use of free cash flow as a key liquidity metric and the acknowledgment of potential negative free cash flows from increased content investments all reflect risk assessment, resource allocation and crisis-management mechanisms that enable the organization to recover and reconstitute its financial trajectory toward long-term objectives.  Moreover, the company’s recognition of its dependence on external capital markets, its assessment of tax and repatriation liabilities and its commitment to raise additional funds if necessary illustrate proactive foresight, adaptation strategies and a commitment to emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

The MD&A discloses that the company faced a challenging business environment in 2015, as global macro-economic volatility, especially in the Greater China region, along with competitive pressures and reduced OEM demand in advance of Microsoft Windows 10, contributed to a 28% decline in net revenue; despite these conditions, the company continued to focus on introducing a more diverse product portfolio and on service innovation, introduced multiple new products across its computing and graphics and embedded segments, and maintained operational continuity through enhanced resource allocation, simplification of its business and organizational realignment. The company took steps to better align resources around strategic priorities, implementing in the third quarter a restructuring plan that included a 5% workforce reduction, outsourcing of certain IT services and application development, and consolidation of real estate facilities, realizing approximately $8 million in operational savings in 2015 and expecting $48 million in savings in 2016. As part of its strategy to simplify and sharpen its investment focus, the company exited the dense server systems business, fully impaired related intangible assets and expects the exit activities to be completed by the first quarter of 2016. In addition, the company secured liquidity through a revolving credit facility, believes its cash balances, cost reduction initiatives and credit lines will be sufficient to fund operations and capital expenditures over the next twelve months, and acknowledges that uncertain global economic conditions could limit access to capital markets and affect its ability to refinance maturities. The company’s continued strategic transformation included a realignment of its organizational structure into two reportable segments, the negotiating and amendment of supply agreements—such as the wafer supply agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES under which GF agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to transition supply to alternate providers and to fulfill orders for two years following expiration—and strategic joint ventures to preserve manufacturing, assembly and packaging services. The MD&A further details governance adjustments and accounting changes, such as the deconsolidation of GF, various amendments to its WSA, the performance of annual goodwill impairment analyses that consider challenging market trends in fair value estimates, the evaluation of inventory obsolescence based on projected sales outlook, and the application of prudent tax planning strategies in assessing deferred tax asset recoverability.

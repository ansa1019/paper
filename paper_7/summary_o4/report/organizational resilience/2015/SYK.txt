The Company emphasizes structural flexibility and resource reconfiguration to maintain performance under varying conditions, noting that “we generally maintain separate dedicated sales forces for each of our principal product lines to provide focus and a high level of expertise to each medical specialty served,” that its success “depends on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products” through “internal innovation … and focused acquisitions,” and that it pursues a capital allocation strategy prioritizing acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases to preserve financial strength and competitive advantage. Management supplements GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures—such as percentage sales growth in constant currency and adjusted net earnings—to provide a baseline for analyzing underlying trends, to remove the impact of foreign exchange and acquisition effects, and to support decision-making and incentive compensation. The Company’s global cash management strategy “takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations,” and it “anticipates being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs … from a variety of sources, including cash from operations, commercial paper and existing credit lines,” thereby ensuring operational continuity and crisis preparedness. It “enters into designated and non-designated forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations,” maintains “reserves for excess and obsolete inventory” to address potential product obsolescence, and undertakes disciplined impairment testing of goodwill, indefinite‐lived intangibles and other long-lived assets whenever “events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable,” all of which reflect proactive risk assessment, capacity for positive adjustment under pressure and a systemic perspective aimed at preserving integrity, adaptability and performance in the face of external pressures and unexpected disturbances.

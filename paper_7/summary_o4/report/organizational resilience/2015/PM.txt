In the fourth quarter of 2015, to further align with the member state composition of the European Union, PMI transferred the management of its operations in Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Slovenia from its EEMA segment to its European Union segment, resulting in the reclassification of prior-year amounts with no impact on consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows; during 2015, the company recorded pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs of $68 million related to severance costs for organizational restructuring in the European Union segment and in 2014 recorded pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs of $535 million related to factory closures in the Netherlands, Australia and Canada and the restructuring of the U.S. leaf purchasing model, including the discontinuation of cigarette production at its Bergen op Zoom factory following consultations and agreement with employee representatives; the company’s net revenues and operating income remain subject to multiple factors—including volume of products sold, product pricing, changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of brands and shipment volumes across markets—while the unfavorable currency impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar against major currencies and higher average debt levels, partially offset by lower average interest rates, have affected profitability across primary revenue markets and local currency cost bases; as a holding company, PMI’s principal sources of funds to service debt are dividends and repayments of debt from its subsidiaries, which are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or make distributions; the favorable diluted EPS impact in 2014 from the repurchase of common stock under its share repurchase program and the definition of adjusted diluted EPS—excluding asset impairment and exit costs, discrete tax items and unusual items to represent core earnings, improve comparability and help investors analyze performance trends—demonstrate strategic resource deployment and performance-maintenance measures; on February 4, 2016, the company announced guidance for full-year reported diluted EPS of $4.25 to $4.35 per share at prevailing exchange rates, representing a 10% to 12% increase versus adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42 in 2015 excluding an approximately $0.60 per share unfavorable currency impact, while reserving the option to revisit share repurchases as the year unfolds and estimating a 2.0%–2.5% decline in 2016 international cigarette volume in line with the 2.4% decline in 2015; this guidance excludes the impact of future acquisitions, unanticipated asset impairment and exit cost charges, changes in currency exchange rates and any unusual events, with continuing risks to this forecast described in Item 1A.

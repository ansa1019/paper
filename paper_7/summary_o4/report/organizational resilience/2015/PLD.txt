In management’s view, organizational resilience is reflected in the combination of the scale and quality of our operating platform, the skills of our team and the strength of our balance sheet, which together provide unique competitive advantages and enable us to absorb market perturbations while preserving and improving performance; rising market rents and strong demand across global logistics markets have fueled development and value creation through disciplined land control, stabilization of $1.8 billion of projects in 2015 and economies of scale that permit strategic capital deployment with minimal incremental overhead. We continuously reconfigure our portfolio through acquisitions, dispositions and co-investment ventures—financed by unsecured senior notes, term loans, credit facilities and derivative hedges—to manage interest‐rate and foreign‐currency exposures, optimize resource allocation and maintain operational flexibility, while same-store analyses ensure transparency of occupancy and rental rate improvements. Our liquidity strategy—drawing on operating cash flows, co-investment fees, venture distributions, third-party dispositions and capital markets issuances—supports business continuity by funding development completions, debt service and dividends and retaining cash for strategic initiatives. Risk mitigation is reinforced by environmental reviews that preclude material liabilities, impairment testing of long-lived assets when recoverability is in question, capitalization of development and leasing costs to align expenses with expected cash flows, prudent control assessments and adherence to critical accounting policies for consolidations, business combinations and derivative instruments. Together with a dividend policy that balances REIT compliance and capital retention, these measures sustain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, ensuring system integrity, adaptability and continuity consistent with the maintenance of organizational performance and resilience.

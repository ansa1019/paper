Management has prioritized continued investment across three key areas—core products and services to better serve existing communities and businesses, next-generation services such as Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, and long-term innovation efforts including connectivity, virtual reality and artificial intelligence research—to support sustainable growth and adapt to evolving market conditions. The company expects significant expense growth as it expands data center capacity, network infrastructure and operating resources, and plans capital expenditures of approximately $4.0 billion to $4.5 billion in 2016. This expansion is complemented by hiring additional software engineers, technical, marketing, sales and administrative personnel to enhance operational flexibility and deploy resources effectively. Principal sources of liquidity—cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and an undrawn $6.5 billion revolving credit facility—together with strong cash flows from operations, are expected to ensure business continuity and meet funding needs for the foreseeable future. Risk assessment and mitigation processes are maintained through quarterly reviews of loss contingencies based on probability and reasonable estimation, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, and contractual obligations under operating and capital leases, thereby reinforcing the organization’s ability to absorb financial and legal pressures while preserving performance and system integrity under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

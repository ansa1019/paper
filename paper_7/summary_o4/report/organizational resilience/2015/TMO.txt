Consistent with the scholarly definition of organizational resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” (Vogus & Sutcliffe, 2007: 3418), management underscores the firm’s capacity to absorb strain and maintain performance by augmenting internal growth with complementary acquisitions and divestitures, reconfiguring its four-segment structure, and deploying resources through its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, global sourcing initiatives, headcount reductions and facility consolidations to drive cost efficiencies and operational flexibility. Liquidity and continuity are secured via prudent working capital management, a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility held undrawn to mitigate commercial paper market disruptions, proactive debt issuance to fund major acquisitions and substantial cash reserves, which, together with forecasted operating cash flows, are expected to satisfy business requirements for at least 24 months under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions. Risk assessment and mitigation mechanisms are evident in the accrual of allowances for doubtful accounts, inventory obsolescence and legal contingencies, and in annual impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets in response to adverse business conditions, economic shifts, technological changes or competitive pressures. The establishment of deferred tax valuation allowances, pension and retiree benefit plan assumptions, and contractual commitments for capital expenditures and lease obligations further reflect the company’s systemic approach to preserving integrity and performance despite external disturbances, regulatory constraints and market volatility.

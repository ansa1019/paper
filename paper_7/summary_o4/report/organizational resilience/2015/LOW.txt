Throughout 2015, we remained committed to our key priorities, capitalizing on opportunities within an improving economy and pursuing top-line growth through differentiating ourselves with better customer experiences, improving our product and service offering for the pro customer, and driving productivity and profitability. In addition, we continued to enhance our omni-channel capabilities, providing not just the products, but also the services, information, and advice to help our customers at every step of the home improvement journey and build a greater affinity for the Lowe’s brand. Through collaboration between our merchants, stores, and customer experience design team, we leveraged our customer experience design capabilities as well as our larger store format to showcase the outdoor living experience and the holiday décor experience, which drove strong sales and attachment for products during the year. We re-launched lowesforpros.com in the first half of the year to provide the pro customer with an easy online ordering experience with their choice of in-store pick-up or delivery, saving the pro time and money, and continued reconnecting with pro customers through targeted marketing as well as pro-focused events to drive awareness and generate new business. In an effort to drive expense productivity during 2015, we effectively managed payroll hours on solid comparable sales growth and improved productivity in advertising through targeted spend, leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings on indirect spend and improving the flow through of sales dollars to operating profit. As we move into 2016, we continue to take a prudent approach to managing our portfolio of businesses, making decisions that will shape how we better serve and connect with customers, focusing our resources on areas of the business where we see greater potential return on investment following our decision to exit the Australian home improvement market, and accelerating our growth strategy by entering into a definitive agreement to acquire Rona Inc., supported by financing from the debt capital markets and an option to purchase Canadian dollars to mitigate currency risk. Cash flows from operating activities, our $1.75 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement supporting our commercial paper program, self-insurance programs for workers’ compensation, automobile, general and product liability, extended protection plan, and certain medical and dental claims and disciplined capital expenditure planning are expected to provide the primary source of our liquidity and support investments in existing and new stores, technology enhancements, our distribution network and returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We regularly review long-lived assets and equity method investments for impairment, record inventory reserves for obsolescence and shrinkage based on historical experience and current trends, and apply judgment in our estimates of self-insurance liabilities, vendor funding accruals, deferred revenues, and cost of sales estimates, all of which are intended to preserve our financial integrity and maintain performance under nominal, extreme or exceptional internal or external variations and disturbances.

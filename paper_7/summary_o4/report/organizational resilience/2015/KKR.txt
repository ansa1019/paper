As a global investment firm, KKR’s operations are exposed to financial and economic conditions worldwide, which have a substantial impact on investment valuations, our ability to exit positions profitably and to deploy new capital, and although periods of volatility and dislocation in the capital markets present substantial risks, they also can offer opportunities to invest at reduced valuations that position the firm for future growth. Our capacity to attract new capital and investors depends on the perception of our offerings as resilient vehicles for capital appreciation, and our ability to maintain and grow revenues is contingent upon successfully deploying capital across private equity, energy, infrastructure, real estate and credit strategies, supported by committed but uncalled resources totalling over $22.8 billion in our private markets segment, thereby preserving operational flexibility under adverse conditions. We manage credit, commodity and currency exposures through diversified funding sources—including senior note issuances, credit facilities, CLO platforms and hedging strategies—and adapt to higher cost of financing, widened credit spreads, interest‐rate changes and currency volatility by adjusting investment levels, maintaining a long-term horizon and selectively seeding new strategic initiatives such as corporate capital trust and merchant capital solutions, all designed to preserve liquidity, absorb strain and support continuity. Declines in oil and gas prices and commodity markets, along with heightened equity market volatility, have prompted amplified risk mitigation measures and capital reallocation decisions, while our distribution policy, equity repurchase program and expense‐allocation framework enable us to conserve capital when transaction activity dips. Rigorous fair value measurements, including level III inputs subject to independent review, and carry arrangements with clawback and net‐loss sharing provisions ensure system integrity and that performance shortfalls are absorbed before profits are shared, supporting the preservation of organizational functioning and the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging internal or external variations.

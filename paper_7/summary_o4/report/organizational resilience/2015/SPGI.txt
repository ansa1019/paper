In 2015, we continued to focus on investments in targeted financial assets, divesting selected non-core assets, reducing our real estate portfolio and increasing shareholder return; we used the after-tax proceeds from the sale to make selective acquisitions, investments, share repurchases and for general corporate purposes; we are aligning our efforts against two key strategic prioritiesâ€”creating growth by executing strategic initiatives, strengthening core capabilities and collaborating across businesses, and driving performance by delivering operational excellence, managing and mitigating risk and enhancing leadership and accountability; we have reviewed new laws, regulations and rules and have implemented, or are planning to implement, changes as required to adapt our rating processes under internal and external pressures; we created a portfolio focused on scalable, industry-leading, interrelated businesses in the capital and commodity markets and continue to invest in digital capabilities to integrate our brands more deeply into customer workflows, compete more effectively and lay the foundation for new products and revenue streams; we intend to deliver our products and services through customer-centric distribution channels that enable mission-critical decisions; we have reconfigured our infrastructure through consolidation of our corporate headquarters, reduction of our real estate footprint and disposal of non-core assets to reconstitute our operational platform; we have identified operating efficiencies primarily related to restructuring and undertaken cost containment efforts to preserve and improve functioning; in our commodities and commercial segment we leverage proprietary content, data, analytic services and pricing benchmarks that enable informed decisions, minimize risk and increase efficiency; and throughout these measures we maintain a systemic perspective on resource allocation and risk mitigation to absorb strain, adapt to environmental disruptions and emerge stronger under challenging conditions.

PepsiCo’s 2015 annual report describes a comprehensive risk management framework—overseen by the board of directors, a senior management risk committee and divisional risk teams, and supported by an integrated risk management office—that is designed to identify, assess, prioritize, address and communicate strategic, financial, operational, compliance, safety, reputational and other risks; it acknowledges volatile macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical and social instability, currency fluctuations, resource scarcity and intensified regulation as both challenges and opportunities, and outlines multi-year productivity initiatives (launched in 2012 and 2014) to strengthen organizational capabilities through manufacturing automation, global supply-chain integration, facility optimization, process simplification and shared services, thereby reconfiguring resources, enhancing operational flexibility and preserving performance under pressure. The report also highlights hedging strategies for commodity, foreign exchange and interest-rate exposures, disciplined capital allocation, the Performance with Purpose sustainability strategy (focusing on human, environmental and talent priorities) to foster long-term continuity and adaptability, and organizational changes such as refranchising of international beverage operations and the deconsolidation of Venezuelan subsidiaries under severe currency restrictions—each action illustrating management’s reconfiguration of its trajectory and reconstitution of operations in response to exceptional conditions, consistent with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging circumstances.

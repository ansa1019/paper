As global operating conditions have become more challenging under the pressures of competition, industry regulation and cost containment efforts, the company continually takes measures to evaluate, adapt and improve the organization and its business practices to better meet customer needs and believes that it is well positioned to respond to the evolving health care environment and market forces. Merck executes its research and development-focused strategy, advances its pipeline and commercial portfolio while maintaining a disciplined approach to cost management and delivering capital returns to shareholders. Business development is a critical part of the companyâ€™s strategy as it looks to combine internal and external innovation to enhance its pipeline and is committed to making externally sourced programs a greater component of its pipeline strategy through licensing and external alliances across early research to late-stage compounds. While continuing to support its in-line portfolio and ongoing product launches, the company also reviews its existing assets as part of its portfolio assessment process to determine whether they can provide the best short- and longer-term value, resulting in divestitures of its consumer care and ophthalmics businesses and potential future divestitures. In 2013, the company initiated global and merger restructuring programs to sharpen its commercial and research and development focus by eliminating positions, reducing its global real estate footprint, improving the efficiency of its manufacturing and supply networks and consolidating facilities; these actions achieved the projected cost savings goals, enabled resource re-allocation to its strongest brands and most promising pipeline assets and demonstrate its operational flexibility and resilience in maintaining performance and transforming itself under disruptive change.

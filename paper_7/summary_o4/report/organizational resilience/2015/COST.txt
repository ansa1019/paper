We believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to changes in economic health and competitive conditions—such as through pricing adjustments and merchandise‐mix shifts, including increased private‐label penetration—and are investing in ongoing information systems modernization to enhance resilience by absorbing external perturbations and preserving performance. Our generally uniform operating model across U.S., Canadian and other international segments provides operational flexibility and scale economies that enable us to leverage growth to reduce warehouse operating and SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales while maintaining compensation levels above industry averages to reduce turnover and enhance employee satisfaction, effectively absorbing cost fluctuations without transferring them to members. We actively assess and mitigate risks from currency‐exchange and gasoline‐price fluctuations by calculating impacts of current versus prior period rates, absorbing incremental costs, holding prices steady and adjusting sales strategies to sustain business continuity. We maintain liquidity through robust cash flows from warehouse operations, substantial cash and short‐term investments, bank credit facilities and commercial paper programs and believe these resources will meet our foreseeable capital and working‐capital needs, including planned fiscal 2016 capital expenditures of $2.8–$3.0 billion for new and remodeled warehouses, technology enhancements and initial operations. Strategic deployment of resources is further demonstrated by share repurchase authorizations, quarterly and special cash dividends financed in part through senior notes issuances, and systematic management of long‐term debt, lease and purchase‐commitment obligations. We also monitor the reinvestment status of foreign earnings for deferred tax considerations, reflecting a future-oriented approach to organizational resilience and financial risk mitigation.

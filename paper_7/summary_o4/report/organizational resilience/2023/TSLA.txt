Tesla continues to enhance its digital technologies and information systems capabilities by investing in artificial intelligence, software development and fleet-based services to support and transform its business strategies and work processes, including the deployment of over-the-air software updates and internet connectivity as stand-ready obligations; it focuses on improving and further deploying its full self-driving (FSD) capability features, recognizing revenue for FSD functionality upon delivery and for ongoing maintenance over time, and provision of connectivity, free supercharging and software updates on a straight-line basis as part of its performance obligations.  The cost of automotive sales revenue explicitly includes vehicle connectivity costs and FSD ongoing maintenance costs, illustrating the integration of IT and digital services into manufacturing and after-sales operations, while selling, general and administrative expenses reflect personnel and facilities costs related to its information technology organization in support of sales, marketing, finance, human resources and legal functions.  Capital expenditure trends disclose continued investment in autonomy and other AI-enabled products and expansion of digital infrastructure, and in 2022 the company recorded an impairment loss and realized gains relating to its holdings of digital assets, evidencing active management of digital resources.  Collectively, these disclosures demonstrate Teslaâ€™s competence in acquiring, deploying and reconfiguring IT and digital resources to enhance customer experience, optimize processes, leverage strategic resources and sustain competitive advantage.

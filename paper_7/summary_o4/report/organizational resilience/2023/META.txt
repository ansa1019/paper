Our discussion reflects a sustained focus on the deployment and enhancement of our IT capability through substantial investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure and technical infrastructure that underpin both our family of apps and reality labs segments. In 2023, capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, totaled $28.10 billion largely to develop and scale data center initiatives, support higher operational expenses for bandwidth and energy, and consolidate facilities, while cost of revenue included depreciation of servers, network equipment and buildings, payroll and share-based compensation for operations teams, and related content costs. Research and development expenses rose to $38.48 billion, encompassing payroll and share-based compensation as well as facilities costs for engineering and technical teams working on new product development, existing product improvements and long-term, cutting-edge metaverse technologies such as virtual, augmented and mixed reality devices and neural interfaces. We have made significant investments in artificial intelligence—including generative AI—to evolve our advertising systems, improve delivery, targeting and measurement capabilities, develop privacy-enhancing technologies that rely on anonymized or aggregated third-party data, and explore new open standards for private and secure data processing. Our advertising revenue growth was driven by the use of targeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user activity on external websites and services, the application of complex algorithms and machine-learning models to estimate unique daily and monthly active user metrics, and the development of tools enabling marketers to share their own data into our systems and generate more valuable signals. These efforts illustrate our competence in mobilizing and configuring IT resources—technology, knowledge, management skills, process understanding and human capital—to support shifting business needs, enhance operational flexibility and responsiveness to market dynamics, and to transform our firm into a more agile, digitally enabled competitive force.

During fiscal 2023, the company’s operational and financial systems continued to evolve, particularly the data systems for capturing and tracking product and customer information – including technical characteristics, “sold to” and “ship to” details and end-market applications – with the methodology regularly improved to more accurately categorize revenue by end market and to reclassify prior periods when warranted; the firm also leverages its website as a sales channel alongside direct sales, third-party distributors and independent representatives. Management further invests materially in research and development of innovative technologies and processes to maintain product leadership and support new offerings, while capital expenditures of $1.3 billion to enhance global resiliency underscore the commitment to sustaining operational flexibility and resource deployment. In managing liquidity and global cash requirements, management routinely reviews available funds held in foreign subsidiaries, evaluates cost-effective repatriation strategies and employs forward foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge exposures, and the company applies advanced valuation methodologies – including discounted cash flows and market approaches for goodwill impairment testing and Monte Carlo simulations for market-based equity awards – to underpin rigorous financial reporting and strategic decision-making.

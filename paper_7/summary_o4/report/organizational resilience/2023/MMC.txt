Mercer delivers “technology-driven solutions” that help organizations redefine the world of work, reshape retirement and investment outcomes, and unlock health and well-being for a changing workforce. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the company initiated restructuring activities focused on workforce actions, “rationalization of technology and functional services,” and reductions in real estate, and in 2023 incurred $301 million of charges, primarily related to severance and lease exit costs for those initiatives. Additions to fixed assets and capitalized software amounted to $416 million in 2023 (and $470 million in 2022), “related primarily to software development costs, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities, and technology equipment purchases.” The company continues to invest in its digital infrastructure and software platforms to support its risk advisory, reinsurance and consulting services and to enhance operational efficiency, process automation and data management across its four market-leading businesses. Through targeted investments in IT resources and capabilities, including management skills and business process understanding, the company seeks to mobilize and deploy technology-based resources in combination with its human capital and organizational assets to drive innovation, strengthen client connectivity and maintain competitive advantage. Ongoing technology rationalization is designed to streamline IT architectures, reduce duplication, improve system reliability and security, and better align technology expenditures with strategic business priorities. By capitalizing on software development and technology equipment investments, the firm aims to enhance information processing capacity, decision-making speed and overall firm capability in support of evolving market dynamics and client needs.

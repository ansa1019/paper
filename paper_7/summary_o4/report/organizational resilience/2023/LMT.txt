Our Business Overview discloses that we are principally engaged in advanced technology systems and services “including cybersecurity,” and that “key to enabling success of our strategy is developing differentiating technologies, forging strategic partnerships, including with commercial companies, executing on our multi-year business transformation initiative to enhance our digital infrastructure and increase efficiencies and collaboration throughout our business and maintaining fiscal discipline.” We further state that we “invest substantially in our people to ensure that our workforce has the technical skills necessary to succeed, and we expect to continue to invest internally in innovative technologies that address rapidly evolving mission requirements for our customers.” In our Investing Activities discussion, we disclose that “we incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software that are capitalized.” These disclosures collectively reflect our mobilization and deployment of IT-based resources—including digital infrastructure enhancements, internal-use software development, technical workforce investments, and cybersecurity services—in support and enhancement of our business strategies and operational processes, thereby underpinning our competitive position and organizational agility.

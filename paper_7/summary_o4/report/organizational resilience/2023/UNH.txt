Management explains that it is working to accelerate a modern, high-performing care delivery vision through the innovation and integration of in-clinic, in-home, behavioral and virtual care and by using data and analytics to furnish clinicians with the necessary information to deliver the best possible care in the most cost-efficient setting. The ongoing shift to fully accountable value-based care is driving needs for health management services that coordinate care and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which the company believes will provide growth opportunities for its Optum business platform. This transformation requires initial expenditures for system enhancements, integrated care coordination technology, physician training and clinical engagement. Optum Insight revenues and operating earnings benefited from growth in business and technology services resulting from business combinations and expanded technology offerings, and capital expenditures during 2023 included purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software to bolster its information technology infrastructure.

Other operating expenses increased $78 million in fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher strategic investments in technology and other initiatives and support costs for our growing licensed markets. General and administrative expenses increased by $409 million, driven principally by incremental investments in technology, increased support costs of strategic initiatives, including our reinvention plan, and higher performance-based compensation. Corporate and other unallocated expenses rose 20 percent, with approximately $131 million of incremental investments in technology and further support costs for strategic initiatives under the reinvention plan. As part of this reinvention plan, we accelerated purpose-built store concepts and innovations in technologies to provide additional convenience and connection with our customers while driving in-store operational efficiencies.

The Management’s Discussion and Analysis does not explicitly mention information technology capabilities, yet the breadth of activities described—from the coordination of capital investments in generation, storage and transmission assets, to the real-time management of commodity hedging and trading positions, to the consolidation of financial results for reporting and regulatory compliance—implicitly depends on a robust IT capability to acquire, deploy and integrate diverse data sources; to provide accurate, timely and secure information across business units and external counterparties; to support complex risk analytics and decision-making processes; and to automate and streamline reporting, governance and control systems. Such underlying information management and technology resources enable the Company to align its operational flexibility, dynamic capital allocation and performance monitoring with evolving market conditions and regulatory requirements, thereby supporting organizational agility, operational efficiency and competitive positioning.

Berkshire Hathaway discloses that, through its subsidiaries, it “manages our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis” with “few centralized or integrated business functions,” while its senior corporate management “participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the chief executive to head each of the operating businesses.” In its insurance segment, GEICO “markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the internet or over the telephone,” illustrating the deployment of digital customer access channels. The company emphasizes liquidity management, noting that it “continues to hold substantial balances in short‐term investments,” that “maintaining ample liquidity is paramount” and that it “insists on safety over yield,” reflecting strategic resource allocation. In its utilities and energy businesses, customer rates “are largely based on the costs of business operations, including income taxes and a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval,” indicating formal governance and compliance processes. Across its diverse operations, Berkshire underscores decentralized management, digital distribution capabilities, disciplined liquidity strategies and regulated rate‐setting as key elements of its operational and governance framework.

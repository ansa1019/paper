TJX operates six e-commerce sites across its business segments, with net sales from these digital channels comprising less than 2% of total net sales in both fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 and under 3% within the Marmaxx and international segments, reflecting the deployment of online platforms (tjmaxx.com, marshalls.com, sierra.com, tkmaxx.com, tkmaxx.de and tkmaxx.at) to support customer transactions and interfirm relationships. In fiscal 2024, the company invested $844 million in offices and distribution centers “including buying and merchandising systems and other information systems” to support growth, underscoring its commitment to acquiring, deploying and integrating IT resources alongside physical assets. These digital technologies and information systems capabilities facilitate the coordination of TJX’s assets, internal processes, inventory management and supply chain operations, enable timely and reliable data provision, and support strategic and operational decision-making.

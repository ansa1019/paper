ServiceNow’s intelligent Now Platform is a cloud-based solution with embedded artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities that helps global enterprises across industries, universities and governments unify and digitize their workflows and automates workflows across an entire enterprise by connecting disparate departments, systems and silos in a seamless way to unlock productivity and improve experiences for both employees and customers. Workflow applications built on the Now Platform are organized along four primary areas—technology, customer and industry, employee and creator—and the transformation to digital operations, enabled by the Now Platform, increases our customers’ resiliency and security and delivers great experiences and additional value to their C-suite, employees and consumers. Subscription revenues include revenues recognized ratably over the term for cloud-based offerings and revenues recognized upfront upon delivery of software for self-hosted offerings in which customers deploy our software internally or through a third-party service provider, with related support and updates recognized ratably over the contract term and software elements recognized when control transfers. Cost of subscription revenues consists primarily of data center capacity costs—including colocation and interconnectivity costs—depreciation of infrastructure hardware equipment dedicated for customer use, amortization of intangible assets, expenses associated with software, public cloud service costs, IT services and dedicated customer support, personnel-related costs and allocated overhead. Research and development expenses include personnel-related costs as well as data center capacity costs and depreciation of infrastructure hardware equipment used solely for R&D purposes and costs associated with outside services contracted for research and development. We continue to incur incremental costs to attract customers in regulated markets by adopting public cloud offerings and by increasing support for customers impacted by new and evolving data residency requirements. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs and include branding expenses, costs associated with purchasing advertising, marketing events, market data, software and subscription services dedicated for sales and marketing use and amortization of commissions paid to our sales employees, with deferred commissions amortized over the estimated period of benefit based on customer contracts and technology life cycle. General and administrative expenses include personnel-related costs, external legal, accounting and other professional services fees, other corporate expenses and amortization of intangible assets. Across all functions, our operation of secure, scalable infrastructure and ongoing investments in data centers, IT services and embedded digital technologies underpin our ability to deliver reliable, timely and secure information and drive the coordination of assets and processes to support and enhance business strategies and work processes.

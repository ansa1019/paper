Nike’s management discussion highlights an evolving end-to-end technology foundation underpinning its consumer direct acceleration strategy, noting that we sell our products through Nike-owned retail stores and digital platforms (also referred to as “Nike Brand Digital”) and are “building a profitable global portfolio” by “delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail.” In furtherance of this strategy, “we continue to invest in a new enterprise resource planning platform, data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering, and other areas to create an end-to-end technology foundation, which we believe will further accelerate our digital transformation,” a unified approach that “will accelerate growth and unlock more efficiency for our business, while driving speed and responsiveness as we serve consumers globally.” The increase in operating overhead expense for fiscal 2023 reflects “strategic technology enterprise investments,” and global brand divisions costs include “product creation and design expenses that are centrally managed for the Nike brand, as well as costs associated with Nike Direct global digital operations and enterprise technology,” underscoring the role of technology resources in supporting Nike’s business processes, responsiveness and competitive positioning.

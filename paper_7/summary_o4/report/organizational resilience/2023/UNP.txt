During 2023, the company continued to enhance its information management and technology capabilities by refining its proprietary precision train builder software to evaluate train and route characteristics, simulate in-train forces, and enable proactive intervention by its operating practices command center to prevent derailments; it supported these efforts with the installation of additional hot wheel bearing wayside detectors and expanded standards for proactively using and sharing critical data, as well as industry-wide deployment of real-time railcar condition monitoring technology. Looking ahead, the company plans to leverage its command center to implement predictive technologies designed to identify causes of mainline service interruptions, develop solutions, and assist employees with best practices, and to utilize data analytics to detect rail defects, mitigate exposure to risk, improve or close crossings, and inform safety outreach with law enforcement and communities. The firm’s operational performance framework continuously monitors key metrics such as car trip plan compliance, freight car velocity, train speed, and terminal dwell, reporting these data weekly to the Surface Transportation Board and publishing them on its website, reflecting a commitment to timely, reliable information provision. General and administrative expenses include investments in computer software, underscoring the company’s ongoing deployment of technology resources to support safety, service, and operational excellence initiatives.

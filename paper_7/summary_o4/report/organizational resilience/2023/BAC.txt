Bank of America continues to expand its information technology capabilities to support its four primary business segments and corporate functions, most notably through its “leading digital banking platforms” (www.bankofamerica.com) which served approximately 46 million active users, including about 38 million active mobile users, as of December 31, 2023. During the year, the corporation’s noninterest expense increased by $4.4 billion, reflecting higher investments in people and technology across consumer banking, global wealth and investment management, global banking and global markets, as well as its global technology and operations teams. These investments encompassed enhancements to digital and mobile channels, strategic hiring to bolster technology infrastructure and capabilities, and ongoing development of data management, customer connectivity and operational flexibility in support of evolving business needs and digital transformation.

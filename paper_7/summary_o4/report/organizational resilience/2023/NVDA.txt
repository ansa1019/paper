We continuously manage product availability and costs with our vendors within our supply chain, accounting for third-party manufacturers’ lead times and constraints, placing non-cancellable inventory orders in advance of historical lead times, paying premiums and providing deposits to secure future supply and capacity, and adjusting to market factors such as competitor pricing actions, new product transitions and macroeconomic conditions that may impact demand for our products. We have demand visibility for our new data center products ramping later in fiscal year 2025 and gather customer demand indications across several product transitions to help predict and coordinate production and inventory levels. Our platforms incorporate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems and services to deliver unique value across four large markets—data center, gaming, professional visualization and automotive—and customers across industry verticals access our AI infrastructure both through the cloud and on-premises. In data center, we launched AI inference platforms that combine our full-stack inference software with NVIDIA Ada, NVIDIA Hopper and NVIDIA Grace Hopper processors optimized for generative AI, large language models and other AI workloads, and we introduced NVIDIA DGX Cloud and AI Foundations to help businesses create and operate custom large language models and generative AI models. In professional visualization, we announced NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud, a fully managed service running in Microsoft Azure for the development and deployment of industrial metaverse applications, and in networking we announced NVIDIA Spectrum-X, an accelerated networking platform for AI. As AV algorithms move to video transformers and more cars are equipped with cameras, we expect NVIDIA’s automotive data center processing demand to grow significantly. Due to our frequent product introduction cycles, which often involve shipping both new and prior architecture products simultaneously while channel partners prepare to support new products, we face challenges in predicting demand, qualifying new products and managing our supply mix, and these complex transitions may magnify execution risk and increase costs. We monitor external influences such as geopolitical conflicts, including the impact on our employees and operations in Israel, and regulatory developments like U.S. government export controls and licensing requirements for products incorporating A100 and H100 integrated circuits destined for China and other regions, which have reduced our data center revenue in those markets and may affect our competitive positioning, supply chain resiliency, capacity expansion and ability to mobilize resources to meet evolving business needs.

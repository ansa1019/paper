Adobe’s digital offerings integrate cloud-based and on-premise/on-device features into a complete end-to-end creative design and document workflow solution that orchestrates the coordination of technology resources and internal processes to deliver enhanced functionalities, utility and workflow efficiencies beyond those available from standalone software or cloud services alone. Integral cloud-hosted components such as Creative Cloud Libraries for seamless asset access and real-time collaboration, Shared Reviews for simultaneous multi-device editing, Automatic Cloud Rendering for multi-medium design work, and Sensei, Adobe’s cloud-hosted AI/ML framework enabling automated photo-editing, content-awareness, natural language processing, OCR and tagging, underscore the firm’s ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources in support of business strategies and work processes. Both subscription cost of revenue and research and development expenses include third-party hosting services, data center costs and network infrastructure operations, reflecting significant investments in digital infrastructure, software development, process automation and operational efficiency. The company employs a data-driven operating model and its Adobe Experience Platform to integrate a comprehensive set of solutions—from real-time analytics and customer data platforms to content and commerce management, journey optimization and marketing workflow applications—that deliver actionable data, personalized experiences at scale and end-to-end orchestration of customer journeys. Capital expenditures on computer and server hardware to operate network infrastructure, non-cancellable commitments for hosting and data center services, and operating leases for facilities and data centers further demonstrate Adobe’s strategic allocation of IT resources to maintain and extend its architecture, infrastructure capability and competitive advantage through continuous innovation and business transformation.

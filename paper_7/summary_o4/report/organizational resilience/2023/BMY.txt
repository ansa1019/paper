The company’s allocations of enterprise-wide costs explicitly include information technology alongside facilities, employee stock compensation and other corporate functions in cost of products sold, marketing, selling and administrative expenses and research and development expense. In compliance with its 2004 SEC consent order, Bristol-Myers Squibb maintains direct-sales agreements under which its three largest U.S. wholesalers, representing approximately 85% of gross U.S. revenues, provide weekly information on product-level inventory and out-movement; these data, together with internal projections of prescription demand and third-party market research information, are used to estimate months on hand and for gross-to-net adjustments. For non-U.S. channels, where direct customer inventory data are less available, the company applies a range of estimation methodologies—drawing on historical sales, prescription trends and third-party research—and continually evaluates and refines these methods to ensure reliability. To govern these processes, BMS has established a company-wide policy, formal review and certification of its financial reports, a business risk and disclosure group, and has engaged outside consultants to study and reengineer its accounting and financial reporting processes.

Merger-related costs explicitly include “integration costs to achieve efficiencies in network, retail, information technology and back office operations, migrate customers to the T-Mobile network and billing systems,” reflecting the deployment and reconfiguration of IT-based resources; our network integration initiatives describe rationalization of duplicative networks, backhaul services and decommissioning of small cell sites and distributed antenna systems, including retirement of legacy Sprint CDMA and LTE networks, underscoring the coordination of technology infrastructure and services across internal and interfirm processes; in operating expense trends for 2024 we expect higher depreciation and amortization “from assets placed into service associated with the accelerated build-out of our nationwide 5G network and the acceleration of certain technology assets as we continue to modernize our network and technology systems and platforms,” and depreciation and amortization for 2023 included “higher depreciation expense, excluding leased devices, from the continued build-out of our nationwide 5G network and increased in-service internally developed and purchased software,” illustrating ongoing enhancement of software development and IT system capabilities; finally, our August 2023 workforce reduction targeted approximately 7% of our employee base “primarily in corporate and back-office functions and some technology roles,” indicating strategic allocation of human and technological resources to support and transform our business processes.

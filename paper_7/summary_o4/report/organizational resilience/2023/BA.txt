We provide the operators of our commercial aircraft with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation, collectively known as fleet support services, which include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents. The aerospace markets we serve include parts distribution, logistics and other inventory services; maintenance, engineering and upgrades; training and professional services; and data analytics and digital services. Airlines are using data analytics to plan flight operations and predictive maintenance to improve their productivity and efficiency and are outsourcing spares management to third parties to reduce the size and cost of their spare–parts inventory. We continually monitor the health and stability of our global supply chain and the global trade environment in response to geopolitical economic developments and changes in tariffs, trade agreements or sanctions, and we mitigate import costs through duty‐drawback customs procedures and maintain extensive monitoring systems to manage and coordinate an expanding network of non-U.S. partners, key suppliers and subcontractors.

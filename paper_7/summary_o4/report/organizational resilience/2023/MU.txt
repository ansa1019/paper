In response to the challenging pricing environment and elevated inventory levels, we have reduced wafer starts to manage down inventories and control supply, recognized significant inventory write-downs and facility underutilization charges, and taken substantial cost-reduction and productivity initiatives—implementing company-wide productivity programs, reducing external spending, suspending our 2023 bonus, cutting select product programs and discretionary spending, and reducing executive salaries—thereby reallocating resources and optimizing processes to support business strategies. To develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we continue to invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities, equipment, and research and development, reflecting our deployment and coordination of technology resources in support of critical work processes. We continuously evaluate alternatives for efficiently funding capital expenditures and ongoing operations, engage in financing transactions including amendments to our term loan and revolving credit agreements to revise leverage-ratio covenants, and leverage our institutional governance practices to align financial and strategic objectives. The cybersecurity review by China’s Cyberspace Administration, which determined our products present a cybersecurity risk for critical information infrastructure operators, highlights our focus on information security, regulatory compliance, and the need to adapt our interfirm relationships and customer-facing controls. To support anticipated memory demand and extend our ability to serve global customer requirements, we are advancing our global back-end assembly and test network, investing in new leading-edge DRAM manufacturing fabs in Boise, Idaho and Clay, New York, and planning additional assembly and test capacity in Xi’an, China and Gujarat, India, underscoring our capability to acquire, deploy, and integrate technology and organizational resources in alignment with evolving market dynamics and business needs.

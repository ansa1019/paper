The management discussion describes the coordination of our real estate and strategic capital segments through rigorous tracking of occupancy rates, net effective rent changes and property-level net operating income, the allocation of property management and leasing costs based on square footage, the formation and oversight of unconsolidated co-investment ventures with third-party investors involving coordinated contributions, distributions and promote structures, and the use of data-driven assumptions in purchase price allocations, discounted cash flow and capitalization rate models, as well as the capitalization of incremental internal costs for development and building improvements and the ongoing monitoring of liquidity, leverage ratios, debt covenants and foreign currency exposures, collectively implying robust information management, analytical and resource-deployment capabilities that support investment decisions, performance evaluation and risk management, even though no explicit references to information technology resources, systems or architectures are made.

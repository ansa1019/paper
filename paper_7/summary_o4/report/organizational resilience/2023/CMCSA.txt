Comcast’s disclosures indicate that the company continues to mobilize and deploy technology resources through ongoing network investments and scalable infrastructure enhancements, including increased capital expenditures on line extensions and scalable infrastructure to support higher-speed broadband offerings and expand the number of homes and businesses passed, partially offset by reduced spending on customer premise equipment and support capital. Technical and support expenses are driven by labor to complete service calls and installations, network operations and satellite transmission, product development, fulfillment and provisioning, while direct product costs reflect access fees for delivering services over third-party wireless and broadband networks and the costs of wireless devices and Sky Glass smart televisions. Revenue classifications underscore the coordination of IT-based resources and business processes, with domestic broadband and wireless revenues arising from sales of broadband and wireless services, equipment and installation services and device sales; international connectivity revenues similarly including broadband, wireless services, device commissions and direct-to-consumer streaming services; and other revenue comprising licensing of Comcast’s technology platforms to other multichannel video providers. The company also notes growing average revenue and adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship as a result of these network and technology investments, and records ongoing software amortization and depreciation within consolidated depreciation and amortization expense, reflecting its deployment and reconfiguration of IT resources in support of business strategies and operational flexibility.

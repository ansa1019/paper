AbbVieâ€™s discussion of its financial and operational processes describes the use of both internal and external data to estimate inventory levels in its distribution channel and rebate claims processing lag times, the tracking of sales by product and by customer or payer, and the evaluation of inventory data reported by wholesalers, available prescription volume information, product pricing, historical experience and legislative changes, with regular monitoring of reserves and adjustments in response to rebate trends and program term revisions, illustrating its capability to mobilize and deploy data and analytical resources in support of decision-making. The company further monitors economic conditions, customer creditworthiness and government regulations and funding to establish allowances for credit losses, regularly communicates receivable status and payment plans with its customers and obtains confirmation of receivable validity, demonstrating operational flexibility and connectivity in credit and risk management. AbbVie also employs non-GAAP measures, such as change in net revenues at constant currency rates, applies a yield-curve approach for discount rate determination in pension valuations and uses probability-weighted expected payment models and Monte Carlo simulations for contingent consideration fair-value measurements, evidencing its deployment of advanced analytical and process-optimization resources. Finally, its global distribution through AbbVie-owned distribution centers, public warehouses and largely centralized national payer systems, the successful integration of acquisitions and the structured transitions of its mid-stage to late-stage R&D programs reflect its ability to coordinate assets, internal processes and interfirm relationships in support of strategic objectives and performance outcomes.

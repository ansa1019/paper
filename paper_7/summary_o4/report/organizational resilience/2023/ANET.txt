Arista’s platforms deliver availability, agility, automation, analytics and security through an advanced network operating stack at the core of which is EOS, a modernized publish-subscribe state-sharing networking operating system that, combined with a suite of network applications and best-of-breed merchant silicon, enables the coordination of technology resources and internal processes to provide customers with a competitive and diversified portfolio of products offering improved price/performance and time to market. We generate revenue primarily from sales of our switching and routing platforms incorporating our EOS software and related network applications and from post-contract support, reflecting our focus on information management capability by providing timely, reliable and secure data and services tailored to changing customer needs. We believe cloud computing represents a fundamental shift from traditional legacy network architectures, driving increased spending on cloud and next-generation data centers and heightening the need for constant connectivity and access to data and applications. The programmability of EOS has allowed us to expand our software applications to address workflow automation, network visibility, analytics and network detection and response, and to integrate rapidly with a wide range of third-party applications for virtualization, management, automation, orchestration and network services, thereby leveraging our IT resources and other organizational capabilities to support business strategies and adapt to dynamic market demands. Our research and development efforts are concentrated on new product development and on maintaining and developing additional functionality for our existing products—including new releases and upgrades to our EOS software and applications—and consist primarily of personnel costs, prototype expenses, third-party engineering costs and an allocated portion of facility and IT costs; we expect these expenses to increase as we continue to invest in software development to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership.

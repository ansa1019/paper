Throughout 2023, management emphasized enhancing customer engagement by combining its network with digital capabilities, acquiring technology-focused businesses such as Happy Returns to provide innovative end-to-end return services and opening its state-of-the-art UPS Velocity Fulfillment Center, and continued growth in its digital access program and deployment of smart package smart facility technology within U.S. small package operations underscored its focus on integrating digital technologies into core operations. In supply chain solutions, higher revenue from its digital businesses reflected expansion of its technology portfolio and capability to support business needs, and management incurred increased information technology expenditures—driven by continuing investments in digital capabilities and network automation—and higher amortization expense on capitalized software investments in support of strategic initiatives. The company also recorded an increase of $78 million in hosted software application fees and other technology costs in support of ongoing investments in its digital transformation, and its current investment program anticipates over $1.0 billion of technology initiatives and enhanced network capabilities for environmental sustainability in 2024, with approximately 50 percent of its forecasted $4.5 billion in capital expenditures allocated to network enhancement projects and other technology initiatives.

Schwab’s disclosure highlights the central role of technology investments and IT infrastructure in supporting its business strategies and client growth, particularly during the integration of TD Ameritrade.  The firm increased capital expenditures on internally developed and purchased software as well as technology and telecommunications equipment, which drove higher depreciation and amortization expense.  Professional services costs rose in line with greater utilization of technology-related consulting to expand and enhance its digital platforms, and occupancy and equipment expense reflected elevated software maintenance and other technology-support agreements.  Operational risk disclosures underscore Schwab’s reliance on the integrity and resilience of critical business functions and technology systems, maintained through a robust backup and recovery infrastructure with geographically dispersed facilities, routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans, and a formal incident management program.  Governance of technology and information risks is embedded in its enterprise risk management framework via the Operational Risk Oversight Committee and subcommittees devoted to information security and cybersecurity, technology operations, third-party risk, data integrity, and model governance, reflecting the firm’s commitment to deploy, integrate, and leverage IT capabilities in alignment with its broader strategic objectives.

The Company relies on a global network of third parties and its internal capabilities to manufacture and distribute products for commercial sale, post-approval clinical trials and ongoing pipeline studies, adapting supply chains for additional formulations or scale increases and making targeted investments in systems, equipment, facilities and expertise to support the complexity of cell and genetic therapies. Management dedicates substantial resources to secure and maintain appropriate reimbursement levels from government-owned and supported customers, commercial insurers and managed care organizations, contracting to enable product eligibility, estimating government-mandated discounts, chargebacks, rebates and fees based on payor mix, and deferring consideration for material rights under annual reimbursement contracts through unit-shipment forecasts. Net product revenues are recognized upon delivery at the net sales price, which requires significant judgment in estimating rebate liabilities and deferred revenue and updating those estimates as claims and distribution-channel data become available. The monitoring and evaluation of discovery, research, clinical trials and nonclinical studies inform frequent adjustments in program focus and priorities as new scientific, business and commercial insights arise, with all research and development costs expensed as incurred and clinical trial costs dependent on program stage, trial size and duration. Acquired in-process research and development assets are recorded as indefinite-lived intangible assets pending completion or impairment, and goodwill and contingent consideration liabilities are measured using income-based valuation models that require estimates of technical and regulatory success probabilities, cash flow projections, discount rates and tax rates, with impairment reviews conducted annually or as indicators arise. Lease arrangements for corporate headquarters and research facilities are accounted for through straight-line rent recognition, and tax provisions utilize the asset and liability method, reflecting deferred tax assets and liabilities at enacted rates, valuation allowances for uncertain recoverability and reserves for uncertain tax positions. Financial reporting, liquidity planning and capital allocation rely on robust information management systems, detailed cash-flow forecasts and analytical tools to support operational flexibility, strategic resource deployment and compliance.

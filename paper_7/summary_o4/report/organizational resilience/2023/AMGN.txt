Amgen employs data-driven monitoring processes to maintain wholesaler inventory levels at appropriate two- to three-week buffers based on supply-demand data from wholesalers and third parties, and it analyzes and adjusts sales-deduction accruals—such as rebates, chargebacks and returns—quarterly by applying historical experience, contractual terms and evolving trends to forecast customer buying patterns. The company continuously monitors the impacts of health-related events—including new COVID-19 variants—on clinical-trial enrollment across relevant countries, working to mitigate potential disruptions and maintain supply resilience. In managing currency and interest-rate exposures, Amgen has implemented hedging strategies—engaging in interest-rate swaps to convert fixed-rate debt to SOFR-based coupons and cross-currency swaps to convert foreign-currency note obligations into U.S. dollars—within its investment policy that limits asset classes and concentration by issuer and maturity to preserve principal, liquidity and risk profiles. Through these integrated processes, the company applies analytical frameworks to assess the recoverability and fair value of long-lived assets and intangible assets—comparing undiscounted or fair-value cash flows to carrying values to identify impairments—and establishes valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when future taxable income projections indicate potential limitations on deductions or credits. These activities reflect Amgen’s systematic coordination of data, financial and operational resources to support business strategies, resource allocation and organizational resilience in response to evolving market dynamics and regulatory contexts.

Microsoft’s MD&A describes how the company is creating AI-powered platforms and tools that deliver faster, more effective solutions supporting business competitiveness and human ingenuity, generating revenue through a broad range of cloud-based solutions, software licensing and services, and device sales, all underpinned by significant investments in cloud and AI infrastructure. We support and invest in our cloud-based services and datacenter operations—expanding datacenter locations, server capacity and GPU availability—to meet evolving customer needs and drive operational efficiencies through software enhancements that led us to extend the useful lives of server and network equipment. Key performance metrics such as Microsoft Cloud revenue growth, Azure consumption-based services growth, Office 365 commercial seat growth, LinkedIn and Dynamics 365 cloud services growth reflect our ability to allocate resources, leverage IT resources, and align technology deployment with business strategies and work processes. Research and development expenses include product development labor, third-party programming costs and amortization of purchased software code and services content, illustrating our commitment to continuous innovation. We continually reconfigure capital and talent allocation—divesting in non-strategic hardware portfolios, consolidating office leases, investing in cloud engineering and strategic acquisitions—to mobilize IT-based resources in support of business transformation, market responsiveness and operational flexibility. Our revenue recognition and unearned revenue policies for subscription-based cloud services, the inclusion of data protection and compliance charges in our general and administrative expenses, and our expectation of increasing capital expenditures to support cloud and AI growth further demonstrate how we acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources to enhance decision-making speed, information reliability and organizational capability across the Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing segments.

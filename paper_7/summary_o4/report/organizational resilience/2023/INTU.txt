Management highlights that sustaining competitive advantage in a dynamic, digitized environment requires substantial IT capability investments across product development, marketing and sales functions and in sustaining the operation and availability of online platforms and systems—both internal and with third-party providers—underpinned by significant allocations of management attention and resources to information technology infrastructure, privacy and security capabilities, including ISO 27001 certification and industry-wide anti-fraud measures. The company’s revenue recognition process, driven by a structured five-step model, relies on IT-enabled systems to identify and account for distinct performance obligations in multi-element contracts, where judgment and estimates can materially affect reported results. Under the acquisition method for business combinations, identifiable technology and other intangible assets are measured at fair value based on projected future cash flows and estimated economic lives, with subsequent goodwill and finite-lived asset impairment assessments using discounted cash flow and market approaches that depend on assumptions about the timing, amount and risk of cash flows generated by technology-related assets. These practices collectively illustrate the firm’s competence in mobilizing, deploying and reconfiguring IT resources in support of business strategies, operational flexibility and long-term value creation.

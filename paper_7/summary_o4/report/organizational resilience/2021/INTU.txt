In August 2020, we reorganized certain technology and customer success functions that support and benefit our overall platform, transitioning these costs to corporate-level management. As our offerings shift increasingly online, the ongoing operation and availability of our platforms and systems, including those of our external service providers, has become critically important. Because we help customers manage their financial lives, we are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities, implementing additional security measures for our consumer and professional tax offerings, collaborating with state and federal governments on industry-wide security and anti-fraud measures, obtaining ISO 27001 certification for a portion of our systems, and regularly updating Credit Karma’s security controls. Our cost of service and other revenue captures the direct costs associated with our online and service offerings—such as data processing and storage capabilities from cloud providers, customer support costs, tax and bookkeeping experts supporting our TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live offerings—and includes depreciation expense for developed technology, while amortization of acquired technology represents the expense of capitalizing and amortizing technologies obtained through acquisitions over their useful lives. We continually evaluate the acquisition of technology and businesses, strategic relationships, and investments to enhance our capabilities, mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in support of our strategies, and leverage our liquidity profile to support such opportunities.

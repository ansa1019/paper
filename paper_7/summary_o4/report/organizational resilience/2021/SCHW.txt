Schwab has substantially expanded its technology‐related investments and capabilities to support both its strategic priorities and its day-to-day operations. During 2021, the firm incurred $559 million of capitalized software costs and $340 million of information technology and telecommunications equipment expenditures—reflecting both the increased scope of technology work and build-out required to integrate TD Ameritrade’s operations and to accommodate heightened client volumes—and expects to maintain capital spending in the range of 4–5 percent of revenues in 2022. To enhance client service and operational efficiency amid elevated trading activity, management “enhanced online self-service capabilities” and “streamlined our call-routing processes,” yielding significant improvements in service levels by the end of the first quarter and sustained gains throughout the year. As part of its preparation for the phase-out of LIBOR, Schwab has transitioned legacy financial models and technology systems to alternative reference rates and continues to implement fallback language in contracts and system code. Recognizing the critical dependence of its business on resilient systems and secure data, Schwab maintains a comprehensive information security program that integrates complementary tools, controls and technologies; employs advanced monitoring to detect and deter unauthorized access; enforces internal authentication measures and data-access restrictions; and provides enterprise-wide privacy and security training. Through these coordinated technology investments, process redesigns and governance practices, Schwab continues to deploy and leverage its IT resources—software, hardware, and security—to support business strategies, enhance operational flexibility, and transform the firm into a more robust competitive force.

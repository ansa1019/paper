Goldman Sachs’ management discussion and analysis highlights that operating expenses for 2021 included significantly higher technology expenses and professional fees and that headcount rose by 8% to 43,900, reflecting investments in new business initiatives and an increase in technology professionals. The firm’s business continuity planning strategy and information security program, together with the design and effectiveness of its independent valuation and liquidity‐stress models, underscore the critical role of robust IT architecture, data management and digital infrastructure in supporting operational resilience. Treasury and independent risk functions employ technology‐driven systems to dynamically manage balance sheet limits, monitor key metrics and conduct firmwide stress tests across market, credit, liquidity and operational risks, while model risk management rigorously governs the development, validation and controls around valuation models and scenario analyses. These disclosures implicitly attest to Goldman Sachs’ ability to mobilize and deploy IT resources—ranging from automated price verification and limit monitoring to secure data repositories—in coordination with its broader risk, funding and client‐service processes in support of strategic decision‐making, regulatory compliance and competitive performance.

Visa’s disclosures emphasize its foundational role as a global payments technology company that “enables innovative, reliable and secure electronic payments” and “facilitates global commerce and money movement across a global network of consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities through innovative technologies.”  The company notes that “our advanced transaction processing network, VisaNet, enables authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and allows us to offer products and solutions that facilitate secure, reliable, and efficient money movement for all participants in the ecosystem,” reflecting the coordination of technology resources with business processes.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Visa “is taking a phased approach to reopening our offices, with most of our employees currently working remotely,” underscoring the importance of digital connectivity and information management capability in maintaining operations and stakeholder engagement.  Within operating expenses, “network and processing expenses mainly represent expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services,” and acquisition-related costs include “technology integration fees” and amortization of “developed technology” acquired in business combinations.  The company also reports that “other revenues increased … driven by higher consulting and data services revenues,” evidencing its focus on data management and analytics services.  Capital expenditures reflect continued “investment in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives,” and pending acquisitions of Tink AB and Currencycloud for €1.8 billion and £700 million, respectively, further demonstrate Visa’s strategic deployment, integration and reconfiguration of IT resources to enhance its competitive position and support evolving business strategies.

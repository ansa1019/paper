We develop and commercialize foundational technologies and products used in mobile devices and other wireless products, deriving revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing our intellectual property portfolio, including patent rights essential to wireless product manufacture and use. In support of business strategies and work processes, we have entered into multi-year capacity purchase commitments with suppliers of our integrated circuit products to secure future supply and operational flexibility amid semiconductor industry constraints. We also maintain nonreportable segments such as Qualcomm Government Technologies, a cloud AI inference processing initiative and other technology and service initiatives, reflecting ongoing investment in digital infrastructure. Research and development expenses increased due to higher costs related to advancement of 5G and application processor technologies and certain long-term initiatives, underscoring our dynamic capability to deploy and reconfigure technology resources. Royalty revenues are estimated and recognized based on preliminary licensee sales estimates, demonstrating our information management capability to provide timely and reliable data for revenue recognition. Significant evaluation and judgment is applied in accounting for the settlement agreement and the global patent license agreement with Huawei, in impairment assessments of non-marketable equity investments, in measuring inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value based on future demand and market conditions, and in monitoring goodwill and long-lived assets for the existence of impairment indicators, collectively evidencing managerial actions, strategic resource allocation processes and organizational practices that leverage IT-enabled decision-making and enhance organizational effectiveness.

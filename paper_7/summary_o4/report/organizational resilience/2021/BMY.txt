Bristol-Myers Squibb continues to employ remote interactions as appropriate to ensure continued support for healthcare professionals, patient care, and access to our medicines across our global markets. In connection with our Celgene acquisition restructuring activities, integration efforts across general and administrative, manufacturing, R&D, procurement and the streamlining of the company’s pricing and information technology infrastructure underscore our emphasis on leveraging IT resources in support of business strategies and processes. We have established distribution services agreements with our U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers, under which our wholesalers provide weekly product‐level inventory and out‐movement information that, together with internal data, is used to estimate months on hand and support internal demand forecasts. We also use information from external sources to identify prescription trends, patient demand and average selling prices, and our clinical and commercial supply chain teams have proactively deployed mitigation plans to ensure a robust and carefully managed supply chain with minimal disruptions. These procedures, governed by a formal policy for monitoring inventory levels and escalating potential compliance concerns, demonstrate our capability to coordinate assets, interfirm transactions and internal processes via comprehensive information management.

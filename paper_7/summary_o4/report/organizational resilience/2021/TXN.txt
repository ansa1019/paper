Technology is the foundation of our company and underpins our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth through a business model focused on analog and embedded processing products built around sustainable competitive advantages, which we continuously strengthen by making investments with an eye toward long-term strengthening and leveraging of these advantages. We apply discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities—spanning the selection of R&D projects, development of new capabilities like TI.com, investments in manufacturing capacity, and acquisitions—and maintain efficiency by striving for more output for every dollar spent. The reach of our market channels gives us access to more customers and design projects and provides better insight and knowledge of customer needs, enabling us to tailor our resource deployment and product mix. We rely on key performance metrics and non-GAAP measures, including free cash flow and associated ratios (with reconciliation to GAAP) as well as operational indicators such as days sales outstanding and days of inventory, to monitor liquidity, working capital efficiency, and cash-generating capability. Our financial reporting processes, which include the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP and critical accounting estimates, leverage robust information flows and management systems to support strategic decision-making, resource mobilization, and ongoing investments in manufacturing and technology infrastructure as part of our long-term capacity planning.

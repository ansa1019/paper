Our business is underpinned by a comprehensive information technology infrastructure and evolving IT capability designed to coordinate our global assets, internal processes, and interfirm transactions through six primary consumer-facing brands and their online and mobile platforms. We invest in software licenses and system maintenance, outsourced data-center and cloud-computing services, payments to development contractors, data communications and other technology resources required to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT assets in support of our business strategies. We constantly innovate to deliver a best-in-class user experience with intuitive, easy-to-use platforms and mobile apps, improving content, distribution and direct consumer engagement and thereby increasing the share of direct and mobile bookings. As part of our long-term “connected-trip” strategy, we are building an integrated payment platform and expanding merchant reservation services to offer secure, flexible transaction terms and capture incremental merchant revenues. Our performance marketing leverages online search engines, meta-search and affiliate channels, online video and display advertising, and monitoring of marketing efficiency and returns on investment by channel to optimize resource allocation. We rely on strategic management practices to align IT investments with marketing, brand building and customer service, while managing competition for technology talent, data security, and the need to adapt rapidly to technological and market changes that impact our firm’s performance and competitive positioning.

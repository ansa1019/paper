Chubb’s disclosures emphasize the critical importance of its information technology capabilities in supporting and securing its operations, noting specifically the “ability of our technology resources, including information systems and security, to perform as anticipated such as with respect to preventing material information technology failures or third-party infiltrations or hacking resulting in consequences adverse to Chubb or its customers or partners” and the “ability of our company to increase use of data analytics and technology as part of our business strategy and adapt to new technologies.” The company also identifies compliance with evolving data privacy and cyber laws and regulations as a key external governance challenge and underscores the ongoing need to deploy and leverage IT-based resources—combining technology, data management, security, and connectivity—to enhance resilience, operational efficiency, competitive positioning, and responsiveness to changing business needs.

The discussion and analysis describes a range of sophisticated financial, operational and risk‐management processes—such as the use of derivative instruments for fuel, power, interest‐rate and foreign‐currency risk, the development of forward price curves based on fuel and heat‐rate inputs, the employment of value‐at‐risk models and discounted cash‐flow valuation techniques, and the monitoring of credit exposures under master netting agreements—that implicitly rest on underlying information management and analytics infrastructures; it also details the tracking of regulatory assets and liabilities, the calculation of retail rate base under multi‐year rate agreements, the preparation of adjusted earnings for board reporting and performance‐based compensation, the actuarial computations for pension and asset retirement obligations using market‐related asset valuations, and the coordination of liquidity, capital‐structure and investment‐funding decisions across multiple operating entities—all of which imply the firm’s mobilization, deployment and reconfiguration of technology‐based resources, data processing capabilities and management practices to support business strategies, regulatory compliance, performance measurement and strategic decision‐making, even though the report does not explicitly label these as “IT capabilities.”

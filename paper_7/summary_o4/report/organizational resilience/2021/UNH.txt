UnitedHealth Group describes ongoing investments in clinical and administrative information and management systems to support care coordination, population health and performance-based payment models and to create growth opportunities for its Optum platform; it emphasizes the leveraging of data and analytics to furnish clinicians with the necessary information to close care gaps and improve patient outcomes; it highlights growth in technology and managed services within Optum Insight, where expanded relationships with health systems and productivity and cost-management initiatives reflect the deployment of digital resources and capabilities; and it notes that Optum Rx’s increased script volumes and operational efficiencies were driven in part by continued supply-chain and cost-management initiatives underpinned by pharmacy care and technology systems that supported vaccine dispensing and improved service delivery, all reflecting the firm’s broader focus on mobilizing information, management and technology resources in support of its strategic business objectives.

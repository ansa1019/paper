Abbott’s disclosures indicate that the company has materially invested in information technology, with capital expenditures of $1.9 billion in 2021, $2.2 billion in 2020 and $1.6 billion in 2019 “principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing and research and development facilities and equipment in various segments, investments in information technology, and laboratory instruments placed with customers,” and that it continues to build out its Alinity suite of clinical chemistry, immunoassay, hematology, molecular and blood-screening instruments along with expanding test menus and deploying informatics solutions and automation to optimize laboratory performance. In its medical devices segment, R&D programs emphasize next-generation technologies that “leverage digital health to improve patient and physician engagement,” while its diabetes care division continues to enhance the Freestyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring platform. Abbott further describes systematic use of internal and external data—analyzing historical rebate trends, accessing large customers’ inventory management data to estimate supply-chain inventory, and monitoring credit-worthiness and forward-looking indicators to establish allowances for doubtful accounts—thereby reflecting a firm-wide information management capability that provides timely, reliable data to support financial and operational decision-making. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Abbott also states that it “continually monitored the effects of the pandemic on its operations” and aligned global operations with government orders and guidelines, implying real-time coordination of information and governance across its worldwide businesses.

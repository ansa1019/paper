Throughout the year, we worked to implement “a physics engine and proprietary software to evaluate train and route characteristics to enable proactive intervention to prevent derailments.” Our operating practices command center will continue “the implementation of our predictive technology and reduce variability by identifying causes of mainline service interruptions and develop solutions,” as well as assist employees with understanding policies, procedures, and best practices for handling trains. We will continue our efforts to “utilize data to identify and mitigate risk, detect rail defects, improve or close crossings, and educate the public and law enforcement agencies about crossing safety” through a combination of our own programs (including risk assessment strategies), industry programs, and local community activities across the network. Management continuously measures these key operating metrics “to evaluate our operational efficiency and asset utilization in striving to provide a consistent, reliable service product to our customers,” and we report a number of these performance measures weekly to the Surface Transportation Board, providing the data on our website at www.up.com/investor/aar-stb_reports/index.htm. Other expenses include computer software, and cash capital investments included $84 million for positive train control and $138 million for technology and other in 2021 (compared with $79 million and $289 million in 2020, and $95 million and $255 million in 2019, respectively).

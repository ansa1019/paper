Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, our global crisis management team has focused on protecting our employees and customers, optimizing our operations and securing our supply chain by successfully implementing business-continuity plans that include establishing a medical advisory group for employees, leveraging work-from-home infrastructure to facilitate social distancing and accelerating capabilities to provide remote physician support. In addition, we have established controls and procedures to escalate enterprise-level cybersecurity issues—including vulnerabilities introduced by our use of third-party software—to appropriate management levels and the board of directors; under this framework, subject-matter experts and a crisis committee analyze cybersecurity matters for potential financial, operational and reputational risks, with issues deemed to have material impacts immediately reported to the board, and management kept informed in a timely manner of known cybersecurity risks and incidents to support effective disclosure.

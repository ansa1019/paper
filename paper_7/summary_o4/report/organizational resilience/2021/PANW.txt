Management underscores that information technology capability is integral to sustaining growth, noting that “to manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner.” The company empowers enterprises, service providers and government entities with comprehensive visibility and context across users, applications, data, networks, clouds and devices to advance their security operations centers, eliminate siloed point products and improve operational efficiency. Its solutions—including ML-powered next-generation firewalls for zero trust network security, Prisma Cloud for cloud native security, Prisma Access for secure access service edge, Cortex for security analytics and automation, and Unit 42 threat intelligence—demonstrate the firm’s deployment of advanced IT resources, connectivity and integration of external, internal and threat data to support and enhance business strategies and work processes. In fiscal 2021, continuous investments in innovation and strategic acquisitions such as Crypsis, Sinefa, Expanse and Bridgecrew were aimed at further extending and integrating the capabilities of its portfolio. The adoption of a global work-from-home policy and its Flexwork initiative, together with end-customers’ use of Prisma Access as a secure work-from-home solution, further illustrate the mobilization of IT-based resources in combination with other organizational capabilities to meet changing business needs and maintain competitive advantage.

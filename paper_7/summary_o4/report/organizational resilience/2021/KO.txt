Throughout the pandemic, business continuity and adapting to the needs of our customers have been critical, and we have developed systemwide knowledge-sharing routines and processes, which include the management of any supply chain challenges. We have transformed into a networked global organization designed to combine the power of scale with the deep knowledge required to win locally. In order to deliver against these objectives, we focused on unlocking the potential of our portfolio of strong global, regional and scaled local brands; developing a robust innovation pipeline focusing on scalable initiatives; increasing consumer-centric marketing effectiveness and efficiency; winning in the marketplace with aligned data-driven revenue growth management and execution capabilities; and further embedding ESG goals into our operations. Our company faces strong competition from well-established global companies as well as numerous regional and local companies, and the rapidly evolving digital landscape and growth of e-commerce in many markets have led to dramatic shifts in consumer shopping habits and patterns; as a result, we must continuously strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation in order to compete in a digital environment and maintain our brand loyalty and market share. In addition, we are increasing our investments in e-commerce to support retail and meal delivery services, offering more package sizes that are fit-for-purpose for online sales, and shifting more consumer and trade promotions to digital.

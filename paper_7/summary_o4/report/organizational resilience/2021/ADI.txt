The MD&A discloses that “as data systems for capturing and tracking this data and our methodology evolves and improves, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time” and that “when this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods,” illustrating the firm’s information management capability; it notes that “we sell our products globally through a direct sales force, third party distributors, independent sales representatives and via our website,” underlining its digital infrastructure for customer access.  The company further describes how “we manage our worldwide cash requirements by, among other things, reviewing available funds held by our foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness by which those funds can be accessed in the United States” and how “we maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk,” reflecting coordination of assets, process monitoring and risk governance.  In response to COVID-19, it explains that “the spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including restricting employee travel, modifying employee work locations and cancelling physical participation in meetings, events and conferences)” and that “our strategy and long-term contingency planning have positioned us well to weather the current uncertainty,” signaling operational flexibility and support for remote collaboration.  The narrative emphasizes that “we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products” and that “we believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings,” demonstrating ongoing investment in technology resources and capability development.  Finally, the company outlines its use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge exposures, sensitivity analyses of interest rate risk, the terms of its revolving credit facility, its accelerated share repurchase agreements and its capital expenditure planning—each reflecting the firm’s competence in deploying, combining and reconfiguring financial and operational resources in support of its strategic objectives.

Starbucks’ MD&A underscores its ongoing deployment of technology resources to support business needs and enhance operational flexibility, noting that, absent significant and prolonged COVID-19 relapses or global economic disruptions, “based on the current trend of our business operations and our focused efforts to elevate customer experiences, enhance digital capabilities and drive beverage innovation, we are confident in the strength of our brand and the durability of [our] long-term ‘growth at scale’ strategy.” In fiscal 2021, general and administrative expenses rose by $253 million, driven in part by incremental strategic investments in technology of $89 million, and Corporate and Other operating loss increased to $1.4 billion, primarily reflecting $81 million of additional technology investments alongside performance-based compensation improvements; these technology deployments implicitly support enhanced connectivity, information provision, resource coordination and capability leverage across the enterprise.

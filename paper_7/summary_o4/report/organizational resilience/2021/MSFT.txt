In our MD&A, we describe how our information technology capabilities underpin the coordination of assets, internal processes, and interfirm transactions through substantial investments in cloud infrastructure, data center operations, and digital services that support our business strategies and work processes. We generated $168.1 billion in revenue by offering integrated cloud-based and on-premises solutions—recognizing subscription revenue ratably in line with our digital infrastructure deployment—and demonstrated our ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources to provide data and services with appropriate accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and connectivity. Our platforms and tools, including Azure, Office 365, Dynamics 365, LinkedIn and other cloud properties, empower productivity, competitiveness, and operational flexibility for customers globally, particularly in response to remote work needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fiscal 2021 highlights include a 34% increase in commercial cloud revenue driven by 50% growth in Azure consumption and a 22% increase in Office 365 commercial growth, reflecting enhanced cloud engineering investments. Research and development expenses grew 8% as we push the boundaries of digital technologies, while sales and marketing investments focused on expanding commercial cloud sales capabilities. Strategic resource allocation is further evidenced by acquisitions such as ZeniMax and the planned Nuance transaction, continued capital expenditures for new data centers and computer systems, contractual obligations for infrastructure and software subscriptions, and revenue-recognition policies that allocate transaction prices to distinct performance obligations across bundled software and services—all reinforcing our IT capability as a key driver of competitive advantage in a dynamic market environment.

Lam Research’s 2021 Form 10-K emphasizes the firm’s ability to integrate hardware, process, materials, software and process control as a core technical competency to support high-productivity, cost-effective wafer fabrication equipment and to deliver lifecycle solutions through its customer support business group. The company continues to invest heavily in research and development—spending $1.5 billion in FY 2021, driven by increased headcount, outside services and supplies—focusing on leading-edge deposition, etch and clean processes and leveraging cycles of learning from its broad installed base and collaborative ecosystem partnerships to drive innovation and enhance value. Underpinning its operational efficiency and flexibility, Lam Research maintains disciplined processes for revenue recognition, inventory valuation and warranty provisioning—identifying contracts and performance obligations, allocating transaction prices, writing down obsolete inventory to net realizable value based on demand and market conditions, and adjusting warranty reserves as actual costs emerge. The company also deploys robust working capital management—monitoring accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses, deferred profit and accounts payable—and secures liquidity through a revolving credit facility, a back-stopped commercial paper program and substantial cash and investment balances to support ongoing capital expenditures, including global expansion projects in Ohio, Malaysia and Korea. Through these coordinated financial and operational controls, the firm mobilizes its technology, human and organizational resources in support of evolving business needs, market inflections such as 3D device scaling and multiple patterning, and its overarching goal of transforming technology capabilities into a sustained competitive advantage.

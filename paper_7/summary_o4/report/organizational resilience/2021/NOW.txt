The Now Platform serves as a central IT capability by enabling global enterprises, universities and governments to digitize and connect systems, silos, departments and processes through simple, integrated digital workflows across IT, employee, customer and creator domains, transforming non-integrated, manual and disconnected processes into automated, connected enterprise technology solutions that enhance resiliency, security, user experience and value. Subscription revenues for our cloud services are recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date, while self-hosted offerings allow customers to deploy services internally or via third-party hosts, with transaction prices allocated between software delivery and support and updates. Our cost of subscription revenues comprises data center capacity, colocation and interconnectivity costs, depreciation of infrastructure hardware dedicated to customer use, amortization of intangibles, software and public cloud service costs, IT services, cyber security, dedicated customer support and related personnel and overhead, reflecting our ongoing investments to acquire, deploy and reconfigure IT resources in support of evolving business strategies. Research and development expenses similarly include data center capacity, contracted outside services and depreciation of development hardware used to extend and optimize platform functionality, while general and administrative expenses encompass digital transformation projects to scale processes, governance enhancements and increased investment in environmental, social and corporate governance initiatives. Professional services and training are delivered on a time-and-materials or fixed-fee subscription basis, recognized as services are performed, and sold through our direct sales force, managed service providers and reseller partners, with related commissions deferred and amortized over the period of benefit, underscoring our focus on mobilizing IT-based resources, enhancing information management capability and leveraging interfirm transactions and relationships to sustain competitive advantage.

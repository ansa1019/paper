Mastercard describes itself as a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners and businesses worldwide by leveraging a multi-rail payments network and its unique proprietary core global payments network to authorize, clear and settle payment transactions. It also employs automated clearing house capabilities for both batch and real-time account-based payments to deliver integrated payment products and services and capture new payment flows. These technology-driven capabilities are complemented by value-added cyber and intelligence solutions and data and services offerings that draw on the principled use of consumer and merchant data to provide proprietary insights, while ensuring safety and security across the global payments ecosystem. Investments in strategic initiatives are reflected in increased personnel costs and data processing and telecommunications expenses within general and administrative costs. Key metrics such as gross dollar volume, cross-border volume and switched transactions are monitored on a local currency and U.S. dollar-converted basis using established exchange rates, and the company manages transactional and translational currency exposures through foreign exchange derivative contracts, some of which are designated as cash flow hedges with gains and losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in net revenue as forecasted transactions impact earnings. Mastercard’s liquidity and capital resources, settlement guarantees, derivative hedging arrangements and monitoring systems all rely on its IT infrastructure to manage credit and settlement risk, while its ongoing investments in technology, data processing capabilities and strategic resource allocation support the firm’s transformation into a competitive force and its ability to adapt to changing business needs, optimize processes and enhance operational efficiency.

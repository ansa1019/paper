We are a global leader in customer relationship management technology, enabling companies of every size to leverage digital technologies—including cloud, mobile, social, voice, blockchain and artificial intelligence—to connect customer data across systems, apps and devices and support their digital transformation around the customer. Our Customer 360 platform delivers a single source of truth by coordinating internal processes, assets and interfirm transactions, while our acquisition and integration of Slack has created a new digital headquarters that mobilizes IT-based resources to facilitate connectivity, information sharing and work-from-anywhere collaboration. We continue to invest in data center capacity, information technology infrastructure and professional services to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure technology resources in support of our cloud computing service offerings, and we drive innovation both organically and through acquisitions to expand analytics, integration and collaboration capabilities. Our research and development investments, acquisition-related intangible assets and ongoing enhancement of subscription and support services reflect our competence in tailoring information management capabilities—accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, connectivity and access—to evolving business needs, thereby enhancing operational flexibility, reinforcing competitive advantage and furthering our organizational goals.

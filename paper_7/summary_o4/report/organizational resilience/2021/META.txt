The company discloses that its cost of revenue “consists primarily of expenses associated with the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, as well as payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams,” and that research and development expenses similarly consist “primarily of payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation, facilities-related costs for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for developing new products as well as improving existing products.” It explains that its user engagement metrics, including daily active people (DAP) and monthly active people (MAP), rely upon “complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models” calibrated against user survey data and periodically updated to improve accuracy, and that these methodology improvements materially impacted reported metrics. The discussion highlights that 2022 capital expenditures of $29–34 billion are expected to support “additional investments in our data center capacity, servers, network infrastructure, and office facilities, as well as scaling our headcount to support our growth, including in our reality labs initiatives,” and notes that cash used in investing activities in 2021 “primarily consisted of purchases of property and equipment as we continued to invest in data centers, servers, office facilities, and network infrastructure.” Contractual obligations include operating lease commitments for offices, data centers and colocations, and capital commitments for servers, network infrastructure and reality labs. Furthermore, the company describes its reality labs segment as generating revenue from “consumer hardware products, such as meta quest, facebook portal, and wearables, and related software and content,” underscoring its software development, digital infrastructure, and content capabilities as integral to supporting its advertising and hardware businesses and maintaining competitive advantage.

General and administrative expense across KKR’s asset management and insurance businesses includes significant allocations for communications and information services and for technology hardware and software-related charges, together with depreciation and amortization, reflecting investments in digital infrastructure and IT-enabled support of business processes, financial reporting, policy servicing and risk management. Consulting, placement and broken-deal fees incurred in connection with fundraisings and investment due diligence imply ongoing reliance on information services and analytics platforms to assess market conditions and investment opportunities. Within the insurance segment, recurring technology-related charges in third-party administrator and policy servicing fees further underscore the firm’s deployment of IT resources to facilitate operational efficiency, customer service, data management and the agility needed to respond to evolving financial and market environments.

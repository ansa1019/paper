During 2021, management emphasized the firm’s reliance on and enhancement of its technology infrastructure to ensure the uninterrupted coordination of its workforce and its inter-entity activities amid the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that this infrastructure proved robust in supporting a remote-work model through rigorous protocols, increased cadence of group calls and updates, frequent leadership‐level communication and sustained investment-committee convenings; the firm further reported that it “leveraged technology to ensure our teams stay connected and productive, and that our culture remains strong” and that client engagement continued via videoconference, teleconference and email in lieu of in-person meetings.  In segment results, Blackstone disclosed that higher technology-related expenses contributed to increases in other operating expenses across its real estate, private equity and credit & insurance businesses, implicitly reflecting ongoing investment in and deployment of IT capabilities to support business processes, connectivity, communications facilitation, and organizational resilience.

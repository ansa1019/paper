Bank of America has significantly expanded its digital and technology‐enabled capabilities, serving approximately 41 million active users through its leading digital banking platforms and approximately 33 million active mobile users as of December 31, 2021, and supporting access to banking and brokerage services via its Merrill Edge integrated investing and banking service platform. The corporation invests heavily in information processing and communications systems, reflected in $5.8 billion of noninterest expense in 2021, to deliver reliable, secure, connected and timely data and functionality to users; these expenditures include technology and operations modifications undertaken as part of enterprise‐wide programs such as the IBOR transition, with updates to operational models, systems and processes and employee training programs. Ongoing enhancements to digital infrastructure and process automation support business continuity protocols, client migrations and the introduction of alternative‐rate issuance and trading services, while monitoring systems and governance frameworks—such as Global Strategy and Enterprise Platforms—are employed to align IT resources with evolving business needs, improve operational flexibility and ensure the effective deployment of technology resources in combination with other organizational capabilities.

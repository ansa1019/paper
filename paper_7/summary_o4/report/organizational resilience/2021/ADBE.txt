Adobe’s ongoing integration of cloud-based and on-premise functionalities underscores an evolving IT capability that coordinates software, infrastructure, data and workflows to enhance business strategies and processes. The seamless end-to-end promise of the Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, delivered through integrated desktop tools, mobile applications, shared reviews, automated cloud rendering, AI/ML-powered Sensei features and libraries for real-time asset sharing and collaboration across devices and teams, exemplifies the firm’s ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources to support creative and document workflows. Investments in hosting services, data centers, network infrastructure, technical support personnel and continuous product updates demonstrate a focus on infrastructure capability, operational flexibility and information management with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security and connectivity. The adoption of a data-driven operating model and the Adobe Experience Cloud solutions to optimize customer journeys and deliver robust customer profiles through AI-powered analytics, as well as the integration of Workfront’s workflow platform into the digital experience segment, reflect strategic resource allocation for process automation, collaboration and market agility. During the pandemic, Adobe’s reimagined digital-first framework, hybrid work model and increased digital engagement further illustrate its emergent capacity to mobilize technology resources, adapt organizational processes and sustain competitive advantage through technology deployment, organizational integration, dynamic capabilities and continuous innovation.

Since 2008, the Company has invested in the development, scientific substantiation and commercialization of innovative smoke-free products, committing more than $9 billion to build world-class scientific assessment capabilities in pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research and post-market studies, thereby allocating substantial resources and competencies to support evolving business strategies and processes; it emphasizes a strong foundation and life-sciences expertise underpinning its long-term growth ambitions into wellness and healthcare, notably through the 2021 acquisitions of Vectura Group plc and Fertin Pharma A/S to secure essential capabilities for future product development and organizational transformation; the discussion of IQOS device supply constraints amid the global semiconductor shortage and the anticipated easing of that tightness highlights the firm’s operational flexibility, resource deployment and supply-chain responsiveness in support of technology-based product delivery; and the recording of asset impairment and exit costs for its organizational design optimization plan and product distribution restructuring further illustrates the company’s ongoing process redesign, strategic resource mobilization and capability realignment to enhance its competitive positioning and performance.

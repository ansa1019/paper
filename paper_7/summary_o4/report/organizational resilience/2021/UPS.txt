In its Management’s Discussion and Analysis, the company explains that its innovation-driven strategic approach “utilizes technology and automation to deliver sustainable improvements to our network and to enhance the customer experience,” highlights its October 2021 acquisition of Roadie, described as “a technology platform focused on same-day delivery services,” and reports information technology expenses within “other expenses” supporting its operating segments. Capital expenditures on information technology totaled $567 million in 2021 (down from $805 million in 2020), and depreciation and amortization expense increased in part due to investments in internally developed software. The company further states that its current investment program “anticipates investments in technology initiatives and enhanced network capabilities, including over $1 billion of projects to support our environmental sustainability goals,” and attributes ongoing productivity improvements and enhanced customer and employee value propositions to its sustained investments in technology and automation.

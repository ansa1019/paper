PepsiCo describes Pep+ as a strategic, end-to-end transformation of its business operations—ranging from ingredient sourcing and manufacturing to sales and distribution—by leveraging its global network and digital connections with more than one billion consumers each day. The company acknowledges a rapidly changing retail landscape driven by the growth of e-commerce, online-to-offline channels and the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and notes that failure to capitalize on these market shifts could erode its competitive position. To address these dynamics, PepsiCo continues to monitor evolving channel preferences and to identify actions to build global e-commerce and digital capabilities, including expanded direct-to-consumer initiatives and support for emerging trade channels. The temporary disruption caused by the implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system in the United Kingdom during the fourth quarter of 2021 illustrates the importance of robust IT architecture and deployment to support operational continuity and performance. In addition, the company’s integrated risk management framework—overseen by its board and audit committee—uses analytical tools and guidance to identify, assess and mitigate strategic, financial, operational and cybersecurity risks, underscoring the critical role of information systems governance, capability leverage and technology-enabled coordination of assets and processes in sustaining business resilience and performance.

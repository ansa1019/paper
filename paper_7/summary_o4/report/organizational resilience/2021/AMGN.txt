We have been closely monitoring the pandemic’s effects on our global operations and patient behavior, continuously tracking COVID-19 infection rates—including changes from new variants such as Omicron—and evaluating impacts on our clinical trial enrollment and supply of investigational drug, and we continue to take appropriate steps to minimize risks to our employees, a significant number of whom have continued to work virtually; to date, our remote working arrangements have not significantly affected our ability to maintain critical business operations or to supply our medicines globally. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties and believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels, and we analyze the adequacy of our accruals for rebates, chargebacks and other sales deductions on a quarterly basis, adjusting estimates when trends or significant events indicate such adjustment is appropriate. To optimize our capital structure and manage financial risk, our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments by type, maturity and issuer credit rating, and we employ interest rate swap contracts to convert fixed-rate debt to a floating, LIBOR-based coupon and cross-currency swap contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange rate exposure on our long-term notes. We use wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, and we conduct ongoing assessments of our distribution, financing and risk-management practices to ensure alignment with changing market dynamics and business needs.

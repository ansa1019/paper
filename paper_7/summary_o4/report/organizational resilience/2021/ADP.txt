Throughout fiscal 2021, ADP emphasized the continual expansion and deployment of its information technology capabilities to support and enhance its cloud-based human capital management solutions, noting that its next-generation payroll solution earned its sixth consecutive top HR product award for featuring a highly scalable, policy-based framework that enables easy self-service and powerful transparency, and that it launched Roll, a mobile-first payroll and tax filing product combining an AI-driven chat-based interface with the power and scale of ADP’s payroll expertise. The company reported ongoing investments in its robust ADP DataCloud platform through the introduction of a Diversity, Equity & Inclusion dashboard with a simple Q&A‐style user interface for tracking and expanding DEI goals, and enhancements to its RUN platform with a new user experience and the introduction of Timekeeping Plus, a native workforce management solution, collectively reflecting strategic mobilization of technology resources, innovation in digital infrastructure, and responsiveness to evolving business needs. ADP further stated that systems development and programming costs increased due to “increased investments and costs to develop, support, and maintain our products, partially offset by capitalization of costs related to our strategic projects, including our next gen platforms,” while depreciation and amortization expense rose in connection with our acquisitions of intangibles and internally developed software. The company affirmed its commitment to building upon past successes through enhancements in research and development and by driving meaningful transformation in the way it operates, underscoring its IT function’s competence in providing accurate, timely, secure, and tailored information management capability in support of business strategies and work processes.

Technology and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for technology personnel responsible for making improvements to our service offerings, including testing, maintaining and modifying our user interface, our recommendations, merchandising and infrastructure, and also include costs associated with general-use computer hardware and software, reflecting our investment in IT resources and capability to support business strategies and processes. We have built our own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) to efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet, with delivery expenses including equipment costs related to Open Connect, payroll and related personnel expenses and all third-party costs, such as cloud computing costs, associated with delivering content over the internet, demonstrating our technology infrastructure and deployment competence. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at the time of sign-up as determined by the company’s internal systems, which utilize industry-standard geo-location technology, underscoring our information management capability and connectivity in support of global operations. Other operations costs include customer service and payment processing fees, including those we pay to our integrated payment partners, illustrating the IT-enabled support and transactional infrastructure that underpins our growing member base.

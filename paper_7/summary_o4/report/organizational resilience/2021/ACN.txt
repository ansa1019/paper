We help our clients build their digital core and transform their operations at speed and scale, leveraging digital transformation initiatives—“moving to the cloud, embedding security across the enterprise and adopting new technologies”—and assisting with application modernization and maintenance, cloud enablement and managed security services. Our consulting revenues, which include strategy, management and technology consulting and technology integration consulting, are driven by accelerating clients’ digital transformations and embedding new technology functionalities to deliver cost savings, operational efficiency, improved customer experiences and accelerated growth. Cost of services encompasses activities such as contract delivery, recruiting and training, software development and integration of acquisitions, while general and administrative costs include investments in information systems and technology infrastructure to support our global delivery model. In our outsourcing business, we provide repeatable services to transition, run and manage client systems or business functions, reflecting our competence to acquire, deploy and reconfigure IT resources in support of business strategies. We measure progress towards completion for technology integration consulting using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs, recognizing revenues proportionally, and we manage foreign currency exposure for costs associated with our global delivery model through customer contract provisions and hedging programs, demonstrating the coordination of financial and technology resources to mitigate risk.

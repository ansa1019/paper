Oracle provides products and services addressing enterprise information technology environments through flexible and interoperable IT deployment models—on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid—enabling choice and facilitating the optimal combination of applications, infrastructure, services and deployment approaches to meet evolving business needs. Our cloud services and license support offerings are deployed, hosted, managed and supported in our data centers, including through Oracle Cloud@Customer in a customer’s own data center, and we enable customers to pivot existing applications and infrastructure licenses and related support to the Oracle Cloud to drive operational flexibility, resource reconfiguration and capacity scalability. The proportion of revenues derived from cloud services and license support has increased as customers renew contracts and access continuous updates and enhancements, driving an upward trend in revenues that funds further research and development investments and infrastructure expansions, including increased data center capacity and geographic footprint extensions to meet current and expected demand. Our hardware business supplies interdependent enterprise hardware products and related software performance obligations and ongoing support for software updates essential to product functionality, while our services business helps customers maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies through consulting and advanced customer services differentiated by our focus on Oracle technologies, intellectual property and best practices. We expect continued growth in cloud services and license support and demand for cloud license and on-premise license offerings to enable further investments in technology innovation, resource allocation and strategic management practices, sustaining our competitive advantage, enhancing our capability to acquire, deploy and reconfigure IT resources, and supporting organizational goals through improved performance, scalability, security and connectivity.

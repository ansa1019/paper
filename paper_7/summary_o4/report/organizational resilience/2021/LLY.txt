Management continuously evaluates our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, and addresses foreign currency and interest rate exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments and periodic analyses of foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. The discussion of acquisitions—such as the acquisitions of Prevail, Dermira, and Loxo Oncology—and related integration and impairment of acquired in-process research and development assets reflects coordination of intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilities across interfirm relationships. References to our consolidated financial statements and supplementary data, the notes to the consolidated financial statements, and the recording of sales return, rebate, and discount accruals for managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, chargeback, and patient assistance programs underscore complex information management processes required to provide data with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, and reliability. The revenue recognition model that includes estimation and adjustment of sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, together with the actuarial measurement of defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plan assets—38 percent of which are in alternative investments—demonstrates capabilities in data analytics, forecasting, and fair value measurement. These elements collectively suggest an underlying information management capability that mobilizes and deploys financial and operational resources to support strategic decision-making, maintain market responsiveness, and enhance organizational agility amid regulatory and market dynamics.

Lockheed Martin’s business overview expressly identifies “information technology, including cybersecurity” as a principal area of focus and notes that the company provides “system integration and cybersecurity services” in support of defense, civil and commercial applications. The company discloses that it “invests internally on innovative technologies that address rapidly evolving mission requirements” and incurs capital expenditures “for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal‐use software.” Within its Space segment, Lockheed Martin emphasizes “network‐enabled situational awareness” to “gather, analyze, and securely distribute critical intelligence data” by integrating complex space and ground systems, while its Rotary and Mission Systems segment includes “cyber solutions” as part of its mission and combat systems offerings. The MD&A also cites “software development” as a current program challenge on classified programs, underscoring the firm’s ongoing need to acquire, deploy and reconfigure IT resources—ranging from infrastructure and software to cybersecurity and data management—in coordination with other technology, human and organizational resources to enhance operational efficiency, execute evolving missions and maintain competitive advantage.

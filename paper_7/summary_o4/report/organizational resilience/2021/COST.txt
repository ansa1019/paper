During 2021, the company recorded the write-off of certain information technology assets no longer expected to be utilized as part of the modernization of its information systems and noted that capital expenditures include requirements for information systems alongside land, buildings and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses; it also highlighted that its domestically and internationally expanding e-commerce business, including e-commerce websites operating for more than one year, contributed to net sales growth—albeit at a lower gross margin percentage relative to warehouse operations—and that its short-term liquidity and payment processing capacity are reflected in unsettled credit and debit card receivables that generally settle within four days, while the maintenance of bank credit facilities, commercial paper programs and letters of credit for working capital and general corporate purposes underpins the ongoing deployment of its digital and financial infrastructure.

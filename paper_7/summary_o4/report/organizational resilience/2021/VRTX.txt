The company relies on a global network of third parties and internal operational capabilities, establishing and adapting supply chain systems and facilities—including distinct processes, equipment and expertise for complex cell and genetic therapies—to ensure stability for current products and pipeline programs and to support clinical trials; it dedicates substantial management resources to secure and maintain appropriate reimbursement levels from third-party payors and government programs worldwide, tracking payor mix, contractual terms and regulations, estimating government and private payor rebates, chargebacks, discounts and fees, forecasting distribution volumes, and adjusting estimates as new information becomes available; it acquires, integrates and collaborates on technologies and programs aligned with its research and development strategies, applying multi-period excess earnings and probability-weighted discounted cash flow methods to value in-process research and development assets and contingent consideration liabilities; it closely monitors discovery, research, clinical and nonclinical data, frequently re-evaluates development programs in light of evolving scientific, business and commercial insights, and re-assesses uncertain tax positions and deferred tax asset recoverability based on enacted tax rates and changes in circumstances; and it utilizes site-specific approaches to manage the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical trials, manufacturing capabilities and employee access in compliance with local guidelines.

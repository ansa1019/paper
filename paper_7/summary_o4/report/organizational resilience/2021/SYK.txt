Stryker’s 2021 MD&A describes targeted investments in digital technologies and advanced IT resources through acquisitions such as Gauss Surgical, whose AI-enabled Triton platform provides real-time surgical blood-loss monitoring, and the announced merger agreement to acquire Vocera Communications, a clinical communication software provider, reflecting the firm’s ability to acquire and deploy technology resources in support of business strategies and work processes. The discussion of disciplined ramp-ups in research, development and engineering expenses for new products, investments in new technologies and integration of recent acquisitions underscores the mobilization and deployment of IT-based resources in combination with other capabilities to enhance information processing, connectivity and analytics. Stryker’s global cash management strategy and financing activities—highlighted by a new $2.25 billion revolving credit agreement with updated LIBOR replacement provisions—demonstrate coordinated IT-enabled treasury and reporting systems that support liquidity management, strategic resource allocation and regulatory compliance across jurisdictions. The use of non-GAAP measures such as constant-currency sales growth, adjusted operating income and free cash flow conversion relies on robust information management capability to deliver timely, accurate and comparable financial metrics for decision-making and performance monitoring. Annual impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets, based on discounted cash flow analyses and fair value estimates, further illustrates the firm’s application of information systems to strategic valuation and risk assessment, while ongoing debt repayments, dividend payments and debt-rating maintenance reflect integrated IT-governance processes that underpin operational flexibility and market responsiveness.

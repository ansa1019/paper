Management’s discussion and analysis describes Alphabet’s ongoing investments in information technology capabilities, noting that it “continued to invest in land and buildings for data centers and offices, and information technology assets, which includes servers and network equipment” to support long-term growth and that capital expenditures in technical infrastructure and information technology assets were $24.6 billion in 2021. The Company “periodically review[s], refine[s], and update[s] our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by the corresponding click and impression activity,” reflecting its information management capability. Operating expenses include compensation for “employees in … information technology … functions,” underlining the role of personnel capability, while cost of revenues encompasses “expenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses, depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs)” and content acquisition costs. Alphabet also emphasizes “significant R&D investments in areas of strategic focus across Google Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets” and strategic acquisitions—such as the $2.1 billion Fitbit acquisition—to “spur innovation,” thereby mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in support of its business strategies. Additionally, in January 2021 the Company adjusted the useful lives of its servers and network equipment, reducing depreciation expense to better align its IT resource deployment with operational needs.

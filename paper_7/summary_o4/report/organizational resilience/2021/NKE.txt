Nike’s discussion of its Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy underscores an evolving digital infrastructure and related investments in IT capability to “deliver compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail,” led by Nike Digital, owned stores and strategic partners. The company has “unified investments in data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering, inventory management and other areas against an end-to-end technology foundation to accelerate [its] digital transformation,” reflecting its ability to acquire, deploy and reconfigure technology resources in support of business strategies and work processes. Operating overhead expense increased “primarily due to an increase in strategic technology investments” and higher Nike Direct variable costs, while demand creation expense reflected “higher digital marketing investments.” Nike Direct digital commerce sales grew 60% currency-neutral to $9.1 billion, and Nike brand digital revenues increased 60%, demonstrating the firm’s enhanced information management capability, connectivity and agility in responding to shifting consumer needs. Furthermore, fiscal 2021 capital expenditures included continued investment in “digital capabilities, our end-to-end technology foundation, our corporate facilities and improvements across our supply chain,” reinforcing the integration of IT systems, analytics and infrastructure to drive speed, responsiveness, operational efficiency and competitive advantage across the organization.

The Companyâ€™s merger-related costs include integration costs to achieve efficiencies in network, retail, information technology and back-office operations, including the migration of customers to the T-Mobile network and network decommissioning, and its capital expenditures reflect property and equipment purchases for network integration related to the merger and the continued build-out of its nationwide 5G network, including tower master lease agreements and vendor-financed network equipment. As a combined company, T-Mobile has been able to enhance the breadth and depth of its nationwide 5G network, accelerate innovation, eliminate redundancies within the combined network and other business processes, realize synergies in network and backhaul costs and provide crucial connectivity as a designated critical communications infrastructure provider. In response to the August 2021 criminal cyberattack, the Company immediately engaged cybersecurity experts, initiated a comprehensive forensic investigation, located and closed unauthorized access, notified impacted individuals consistent with state and federal requirements, reset personal identification numbers, offered two years of free identity protection and free scam-blocking services, published support resources online, and entered into long-term partnerships with industry-leading cybersecurity firms while creating a cyber transformation office reporting directly to the CEO; it intends to commit substantial additional resources toward cybersecurity initiatives, remediation, customer support and protection enhancements in future periods.

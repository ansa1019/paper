Throughout 2021 AMD leveraged its information management and coordination processes to maintain operational continuity and supply-chain resilience, implementing remote-work support for employees and monitoring public health measures, while securing capacity through long-term wafer supply commitments and flexible foundry contracting under amended agreements that provide minimum annual allocations and allow contracting with any technology node. The company’s strategic resource allocation decisions—including substantial prepayment arrangements, purchase commitments and a $4 billion stock repurchase program with no termination date—were underpinned by data-driven market and historical activity analyses used to estimate variable consideration and inventory valuation under ASC 606-10 guidance, as well as by qualitative and quantitative assessments in goodwill impairment testing that consider industry, market and company-specific factors. These practices reflect AMD’s deployment of integrated processes, analytics and governance mechanisms to support business strategies, optimize interfirm relationships and respond to evolving market and operational needs.

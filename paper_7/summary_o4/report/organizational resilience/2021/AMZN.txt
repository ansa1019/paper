We continue to invest substantially in our information technology capabilities by funding capital expenditures and operating costs to build and run our technology infrastructure and to build, enhance, and add features to our online stores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings. Technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services, and infrastructure costs such as servers, networking equipment, data-center depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Our technology and content investment and capital-spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including AWS and the expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve process efficiencies, and we expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. We believe that advances in technology—specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, data storage and analytics, improved wireless connectivity, and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning—will continue to improve users’ experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances, we are investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and we are also investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices.

Throughout our management’s discussion and analysis, organizational resource coordination and information management capabilities are evident in our continuous evaluation of alternatives for efficiently funding capital expenditures and ongoing operations, including the issuance of securities; in the change effective beginning in the second quarter of 2021 from average cost to first-in, first-out ("FIFO") inventory costing and the concurrent modification of our inventory cost absorption processes used to estimate inventory values, which affects the timing of cost recognition; and in our use of recent sales volumes, existing customer orders, current contract prices, industry analyses of supply and demand, seasonal factors, general economic trends, and other information to project average selling prices and sales volumes and determine net realizable value of inventories. Likewise, the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires management to make estimates and judgments based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions, including estimating provisions for income taxes and the realization of deferred tax assets through forecasts of future taxable income across multiple jurisdictions. Our goodwill impairment testing leverages long-range planning processes to develop revenue growth rates, forecasted manufacturing costs, and other expense projections, tests the reasonableness of output through implied value-per-share comparisons to current stock prices and analysts’ consensus, and discounts projected future cash flows using risk-adjusted rates based on market comparables. Further, our commitment to support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality requires us to invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities and equipment, and research and development, with capital expenditures for 2022 estimated at $11 billion to $12 billion weighted toward the first half of 2022 and driven by our 176-layer NAND transition, pilot line enablement for next-generation NAND and DRAM, and infrastructure and prepayments to support the introduction of EUV lithography. Our primary liquidity sources—cash generated from operations and financing obtained from capital markets and financial institutions—are managed in conjunction with investment and credit-risk governance practices under which we invest through high-credit-quality institutions and limit concentration of credit exposure by restricting the amount of investments with any single obligor; these activities reflect our strategic resource allocation, process optimization, and organizational capabilities in managing information, capital, and technology resources to support and enhance our business strategies and work processes.

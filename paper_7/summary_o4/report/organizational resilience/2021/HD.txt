Online sales, which consist of sales generated online through our websites for products picked up in our stores or delivered to customer locations, represented 13.7% of net sales and grew by 9.4% during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 as customers continued to leverage our digital platforms for their shopping needs; total comparable sales increased 11.4% in fiscal 2021 reflecting benefits from our strategic efforts to drive an enhanced interconnected experience in both the physical and digital worlds; purchase obligations explicitly include software acquisitions and license commitments, illustrating our investment in technology resources to support operations; and our disciplined approach to capital allocation prioritizes investing in the business through capital expenditures—approximately $2.6 billion in fiscal 2021 and targeted at roughly two percent of net sales—underscoring the role of digital and infrastructure investments in enhancing long-term strategic positioning and responsiveness to changing business needs.

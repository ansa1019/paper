The discussion emphasizes the use of proprietary data and detailed operating metrics—such as occupancy rates, rental rate growth, same-store net operating income and weighted average net effective rent change—to monitor e-commerce-driven demand and guide leasing, development and capital deployment decisions, requiring sophisticated information collection and analysis processes. The Company’s allocation of property management and leasing costs based on square footage, its reconciliation of segment NOI to GAAP operating income and its translation of foreign currency results through period-end exchange rates and derivative valuations also point to robust data management, reporting and risk-management systems. Construction starts, development stabilizations, yields and estimated value creation are tracked with precision, while cash flow forecasts and non-GAAP measures such as FFO and core FFO involve the integration of deferred tax, foreign currency and transaction gain adjustments for transparent investor reporting. In addition, the use of market-based discounted cash-flow models and third-party valuations to allocate purchase price among building, land and lease intangibles highlights the reliance on analytical tools, and the coordinated management of global credit facilities, senior notes and mortgage borrowings alongside derivative hedges underscores the need for reliable, timely information systems to support strategic resource allocation, operational efficiency and compliance with debt covenants.

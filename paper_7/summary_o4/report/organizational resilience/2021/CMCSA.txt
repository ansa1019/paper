In its 2021 annual report, Comcast describes significant investments in scalable infrastructure, line extensions and software development to expand its broadband, wireless and network operations, product development, fulfillment and provisioning capabilities, reflecting capital expenditures on customer premise equipment and support capital. The company’s expanding digital service portfolio—including Flex and streaming offerings, ad-supported Peacock programming integrated into Sky video services, digital properties and an advanced advertising business—relies on licensing its technology platforms to other multichannel video providers, deploying wireless gateways and set-top software such as X1 and Sky Q, and delivering automation and security services. Management highlights that revenue from digital distribution services, video-on-demand, pay-per-view, content licensing arrangements, OTT platforms, home entertainment sales and Peacock subscriber fees depends on coordinating IT-based resources and network assets to support business strategies, tailor offerings to changing customer needs, and enhance information management, connectivity and data provisioning capabilities. Operating expenses for network operations, technical and product support, monthly wholesale access fees, device sales and programming distribution rights underscore the firm’s focus on mobilizing IT resources in combination with other organizational assets to achieve operational flexibility, market responsiveness and competitive advantage.

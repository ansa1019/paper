The company’s disclosures describe multiple strategies and processes designed to preserve or improve functioning despite internal or external pressures, including risk mitigation through allowances for doubtful accounts, credit loss reserves on financing receivables, and inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete stock; proactive supply chain management to maintain flexibility and competitive lead times amid macroeconomic uncertainties; productivity improvements achieved by value engineering, favorable component pricing, and operational efficiencies; strategic workforce restructuring plans—affecting up to 8% of global headcount—with the intent to reinvest substantially all cost savings in higher-growth areas such as data center, software, security, and cloud to reconfigure resources and support business continuity; financing programs comprising sales-type and direct-financing leases, loans and financed service contracts to absorb strain in customer capital spending and maintain service delivery; maintenance of robust liquidity via a diversified portfolio of cash, cash equivalents and high-quality fixed income securities, a $3 billion revolving credit facility and commercial paper program to address funding requirements and enable rapid responses to changing market conditions; forward-looking statements, projections and scenario planning to anticipate industry transitions and guide strategic adaptation; transformation of the business model from standalone products to integrated architectures and solutions to enhance agility and systemic coherence; and a capital allocation policy targeting the return of at least 50% of free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases while preserving financial flexibility for strategic investments, acquisitions and resource reconfiguration.

Microsoft operates in a dynamic and highly competitive environment with frequent technological and business-model shifts, requiring the ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite external pressures. To maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, the company invests substantially in research and development and data-center infrastructure, leverages the scale and flexibility of its cloud-first strategy to enable organizational innovation while delegating non-differentiating activities to reliable providers, and supports customersâ€™ seamless adoption of software-as-a-service across public, private, and hybrid environments. In July 2014, Microsoft implemented a restructuring plan to streamline engineering processes, increase agility, simplify its organization, and align its reporting segments to optimize resource allocation and operational flexibility. Liquidity and continuity are underpinned by $85.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments diversified for capital preservation, a $5.0 billion back-up credit facility, and proactive issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt to fund working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions, and debt repayments. Risk mitigation practices include the use of derivative instruments to manage foreign-currency, interest-rate, and credit exposures and indemnification arrangements that support customer continuity. Unearned revenue from multi-year licensing programs and cloud subscriptions provides foreseeable future cash inflows, and management expects existing domestic and foreign cash flows and resources to fund operating activities, dividends, and strategic initiatives for at least the next twelve months and to remain sufficient thereafter, with the option to repatriate earnings or raise capital in the U.S. if additional funding is required.

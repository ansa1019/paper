Accenture’s management discussion acknowledges that operating results are subject to macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility and that the company continuously monitors economic conditions and seeks to manage costs to respond to changing conditions. The company proactively plans and manages its workforce size and composition, adjusting hiring levels, attrition, involuntary terminations and compensation across geographies and skill sets to maintain a balance of skills and resources in line with shifting client demand. To preserve contract profitability, Accenture adjusts pricing and resource mix, continuously reviews estimates of contract revenues and costs and records provisions for expected contract losses when anticipated. In its outsourcing arrangements, the company defers and monitors transition costs related to processes, personnel and systems, amortizing such costs over the contract period and protecting deferred amounts in the event of early termination. Accenture manages its foreign currency exposure by aligning most costs with related revenues, incorporating currency protection provisions in customer contracts and employing hedging programs, assessing residual foreign-exchange effects on costs. The company maintains available cash reserves, strong cash flows from operations and committed borrowing facilities, believing these resources sufficient to satisfy working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months, and implements risk management and indemnification arrangements to address contingent liabilities. These practices support the organization’s ability to preserve functioning, reconfigure resources and maintain integrity and performance under internal or external disturbances and uncertainties.

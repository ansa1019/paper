We include forward‐looking statements about the objectives and effectiveness of our business continuity plan, information security program, risk management and liquidity policies, reflecting our focus on maintaining performance under challenging conditions. We maintain substantial liquidity through our “global core liquid assets,” pre‐funding potential cash and collateral needs in a stressed environment, and dynamically manage asset‐liability profiles, including quarterly balance sheet planning and business‐specific limits, to ensure operational continuity and resource deployment under adverse scenarios. Our contingency funding plan sets out risk factors, metrics and mitigants for crisis situations, and our capital planning and stress‐testing process projects sources and uses of capital under baseline and severely adverse scenarios, including the CCAR and DFAST frameworks, to ensure sufficient equity capital and orderly recovery or resolution. Our resolution and recovery plans describe governance and coordinated actions at various organizational levels to manage material financial distress. Our risk management framework, overseen by the Board and senior committees, employs daily mark‐to‐market of inventory, independent control functions, multi‐tiered limits, scenario analyses and robust model validation to identify, monitor and mitigate market, credit, operational and liquidity risks. We employ operational risk controls, employee training, supervisory processes and independent internal audit to prevent and respond to system failures, errors or external events. Together, these processes and controls enable dynamic adaptation, preservation of system integrity and performance maintenance under internal or external disturbances, embodying our approach to organizational resilience.

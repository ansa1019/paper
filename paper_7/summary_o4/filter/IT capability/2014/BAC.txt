Bank of America’s enterprise risk framework and associated governance processes embody resilience principles by establishing clear accountabilities, risk‐appetite limits and a structured contingency funding plan to ensure business continuity under a variety of stress scenarios, including stressed market liquidity and funding disruption.  The firm maintains a centralized liquidity management structure that holds excess liquidity at both parent and subsidiary levels, diversified across high‐quality unencumbered securities and cash deposits, and supplements it with secured and unsecured funding sources as well as central bank facilities to absorb strain and preserve operational continuity.  A robust contingency funding plan, approved by senior management and reviewed by the board’s enterprise risk committee, outlines operational responses—such as accelerated asset sales, debt issuances and de‐risking actions—to potential extreme conditions, while corporation‐wide stress testing and scenario analyses project impacts on balance sheet, earnings, capital and liquidity and guide preemptive mitigation measures.  Front‐line units and an independent risk management function employ an identify-measure-monitor-control process, enhanced by risk‐and‐control self-assessments, to anticipate and counter emerging threats, while continuous model validation and limit monitoring ensure that credit, market, interest-rate and operational risks remain within approved thresholds, supporting the firm’s ability to maintain performance and adapt to unexpected events without significantly impairing its strategic objectives or capital strength.

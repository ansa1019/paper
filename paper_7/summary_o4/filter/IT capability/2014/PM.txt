In its management’s discussion and analysis, the company describes a series of strategic resource reconfigurations and operational adjustments—recording pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs of $535 million in 2014 related to factory closures in the Netherlands, Australia and Canada and the restructuring of its U.S. leaf purchasing model, and $309 million in 2013 for termination of distribution agreements in the Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa and Asia segments and the restructuring of its global and regional functions in Switzerland and Australia—illustrating its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite external pressures. These measures were complemented by stakeholder engagement, notably consultations with employee representatives and a negotiated social plan preceding the cessation of cigarette production at its Bergen op Zoom facility on September 1, 2014. The company’s financial flexibility is underscored by its holding-company structure, relying principally on dividends and debt repayments from subsidiaries not limited by long-term debt in their capacity to distribute cash, thereby maintaining system integrity under variations in taxation, currency exchange rates and market mix. Forecast guidance for 2015, which anticipates incremental spending on its reduced-risk IQOS product to support national expansions and pilot launches, as well as the articulation of adjusted diluted EPS to isolate core earnings, enhance trend analysis and improve comparability, further reflects its forward-looking resource allocation, risk mitigation and performance-maintenance strategies amid market and currency volatility. The disclosure that factors in Item 1A. Risk Factors remain continuing risks to this forecast likewise evidences ongoing risk assessment and crisis management practices intended to sustain organizational performance under challenging conditions.

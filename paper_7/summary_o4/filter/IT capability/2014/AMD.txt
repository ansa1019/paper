As part of our strategy to transform our business to attain approximately 50% of our revenue from high-growth adjacent markets by the end of 2015, we continued to focus on introducing a more diverse product portfolio and by the end of 2014 derived approximately 40% of our revenues from these high-growth markets; to support this strategic transformation and mitigate financial risk, we made progress in improving our balance sheet by re-profiling our debt maturity schedule, repurchased $487 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% convertible senior notes due 2015, redeemed the entire $500 million of our 8.125% senior notes due 2017 and repurchased portions of our 7.75% and 7.50% senior notes, thereby reducing our outstanding debt, and to assist in financing these repurchases issued $500 million of 7.00% senior notes due 2024 and $600 million of 6.75% senior notes due 2019; in connection with our continued strategic transformation, effective July 1, 2014, we realigned our organizational structure into two reportable segments and announced an ambidextrous computing roadmap to develop custom high-performance ARM and x86 processor cores for 2016, reallocating resources toward future orientation under market volatility; to maintain supply chain continuity and manage external pressures, pursuant to our wafer supply agreement with GlobalFoundries we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements, and GF has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist us to transition supply to another provider and to continue to fulfill purchase orders following the expiration or termination of the WSA, and we are currently negotiating a fifth amendment to ensure our purchases from GF remain material; in the fourth quarter of 2014, we implemented a restructuring plan designed to improve operating efficiencies through a reduction of global headcount by approximately 6% and alignment of our real estate footprint; we also engaged in sale-leaseback transactions in multiple jurisdictions, recording net cash proceeds and associated gains while structuring lease terms with extension options; management believes our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance along with the savings from our restructuring plan and our secured revolving line of credit will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, over the next twelve months; however, uncertain global economic conditions have in the past and may in the future adversely impact our business, and if market conditions deteriorate we may be limited in our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs on favorable terms or at all, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and our ability to refinance maturing liabilities, underscoring the importance of ongoing risk mitigation, resource management and strategic adaptation to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adversity.

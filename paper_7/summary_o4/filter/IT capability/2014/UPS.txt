During 2014, UPS navigated uneven global economic growth and shifting trade patterns by actively adjusting its air capacity and cost structure within its integrated transportation network to align with prevailing volume mixes, deploying technology improvements—including several facility automation projects and the accelerated rollout of its On-Road Integrated Optimization and Navigation system (“ORION”)—and expanding or reconfiguring operating facilities to improve time-in-transit, all of which increased network capacity, flexibility, efficiency and reliability. The company undertook targeted initiatives to enhance delivery-network flexibility and capacity, refine yield-management processes, and contain costs across its segments, leveraging its broad portfolio of offerings and inherent network flexibilities to process a 6.4% increase in volume at rates outpacing growth in aircraft block hours and vehicle miles driven, thereby preserving operational integrity under pressure. In response to unexpected volume variability and adverse weather during the compressed fourth-quarter holiday season, UPS increased staffing levels, equipment rentals and facility operations, even electing to operate an additional day to uphold service commitments, and absorbed associated productivity trade-offs. Internationally, UPS reconfigured its air network to reduce average daily aircraft block hours by 1.1% despite a 7.8% export volume growth and multiple service enhancements, mitigating per-piece costs through ongoing modifications and productivity gains. Within its supply chain & freight segment, the company balanced competitive rate pressures, network capacity constraints and volume growth through disciplined yield management, service innovation and productivity improvements in air and ocean forwarding, less-than-truckload operations and logistics offerings. Additionally, UPS restructured multiemployer health-care and pension obligations—transferring retiree medical liabilities to multiemployer funds, renegotiating contribution rates and establishing a 50-year fixed withdrawal liability—to reduce future funding volatility and absorb demographic and regulatory risks. Collectively, these measures demonstrate UPS’s ability to absorb internal and external variations and disturbances, reconfigure operational trajectories in immediate response to disruptive events, allocate resources dynamically, and maintain positive adjustment and performance continuity under challenging conditions.

KKR’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis describes the firm’s capacity to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions by following a patient and disciplined investment approach across private equity, energy, infrastructure, real estate, credit and hedge funds and by employing world-class people, an integrated global investment platform, operating consultants and senior advisors and a worldwide network of business relationships, thereby enabling the firm to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite internal or external economic variations and disturbances. With over 75% of its fee-paying assets under management locked up for at least eight years, KKR retains significant operational flexibility to grow investments and select exit opportunities in volatile markets. Its global offices provide a pre-eminent platform for sourcing transactions, raising capital and conducting capital markets activities, reinforcing business continuity. The firm’s liquidity management focuses on generating cash flow from operations, investment realizations and capital markets transactions, while maintaining access to revolving credit facilities, senior unsecured notes, securitizations and balance sheet resources to fund new strategies, capital commitments, joint-venture equity requirements and debt service, thereby mitigating resource constraints and ensuring business resilience. KKR’s diversified revenue streams—including management, monitoring, transaction and incentive fees—as well as its use of hedging strategies to manage foreign currency risk, rigorous due diligence and credit risk assessment processes, and committee-based governance frameworks (including balance sheet, risk, global conflicts and compliance and portfolio management committees) support its ability to reconfigure capital deployment, manage complex investments, anticipate market disruptions and sustain performance under pressure.

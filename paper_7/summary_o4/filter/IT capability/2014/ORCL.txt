We develop and maintain our products and services to be enterprise-grade, reliable, secure and interoperable while offering customers a choice in deployment models that best meet their information technology (IT) needs; an important element of our corporate strategy is to deliver reliable, secure and scalable products and services that are built upon industry standards and are engineered to work both together or independently, regardless of the deployment model selected; we believe that our investments in, and continued innovation with respect to, our software and cloud, hardware, and services businesses are the foundation of our long-term strategic plans; we enable customers to evolve and transform to substantially any IT environment at whatever pace is most appropriate for them; we engineer our hardware systems with virtualization and management capabilities to enable the rapid deployment and efficient management of cloud and on-premise IT infrastructures; our Oracle engineered systems combine hardware and software offerings to increase computing performance relative to our competitors’ products, creating cost efficiencies, time savings and operational cost advantages for our customers; our hardware products and services are designed to work in customer environments that may include other Oracle or non-Oracle hardware or software components; we strive to reduce costs by simplifying our manufacturing processes through increased standardization of components across product types and a “build-to-order” manufacturing process in which products generally are built only after customers have placed firm orders; our hardware systems support offerings provide customers with software updates for components that are essential to functionality, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services; our services business includes consulting services designed to help customers and global system integrator partners more successfully architect and deploy our products, including IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initial product implementation and integration, and ongoing product enhancements and upgrades; we utilize a global, blended delivery model to optimize value for our customers and partners; our advanced customer support services enable increased performance and higher availability of their Oracle products and services; consulting revenues are generally recognized as the services are performed, with progress measured monthly on fixed-fee arrangements utilizing hours incurred versus total estimated hours; we believe our acquisition program strengthens our competitive position, enhances the products and services we can offer to customers, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings and increases stockholder value; we estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition; we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations; we apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values; in connection with a business combination or other strategic initiative, we may estimate costs associated with restructuring plans committed to by our management, typically comprised of employee severance costs, consolidation of duplicate facilities and contract termination costs; we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350; we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized and adjust as necessary based on forecasted earnings, tax planning strategies and the mix of earnings among jurisdictions; we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated; we believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements; we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our senior notes so that the interest obligations effectively became variable; we have designated certain cross-currency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for these as cash flow hedges pursuant to ASC 815; our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, debt repayment obligations, stock price and economic and market conditions; and seasonal factors have caused a decrease in our first fiscal quarter revenues as compared to the immediately preceding fourth quarter, which historically has been our highest revenue quarter within a particular fiscal year.

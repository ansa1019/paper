This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties, and our ability to expand our installed base and increase our revenue is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. To support our strong growth, we have accelerated our investment in infrastructure, such as enterprise resource planning software and other technologies, to improve the efficiency of our operations. We intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization to enhance the functionality of our existing cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership; by investing in research and development, we believe we will be well positioned to continue our rapid growth and take advantage of our large market opportunity. We also intend to continue expanding our sales and marketing teams and programs, with a particular focus on expanding our network of international channel partners and carrying out associated marketing activities in key geographies. To facilitate channel coordination and increase productivity, we have created a partner program, the Arista partner program, to engage partners who provide value-added services and extend our reach into the marketplace, and authorized training partners provide technical training to our channel partners. We believe that our future success will depend on many factors, including our ability to expand sales to existing customers as well as to add new end customers, and while these areas present significant opportunity, they also present risks that we must manage to ensure successful results. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations; as of December 31, 2014, cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $449.5 million, of which approximately $56.6 million was held outside the U.S. in our foreign subsidiaries, the undistributed earnings of which we consider indefinitely reinvested. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and our growth strategies for the foreseeable future, although if we require or elect to seek additional capital through debt or equity financing in the future, we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us and, if required and unable to do so, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected. Our primary sources of cash from operating activities have been cash collections from customers, and our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been personnel costs and investments in sales and marketing and research and development; we expect cash outflows from operating activities to increase as a result of further investment in sales and marketing and increases in personnel costs as we grow our business. Our investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment, and we expect to continue to make purchases of property and equipment to support continued growth of our business. We record a provision when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value, using significant judgment in establishing our forecasts of future demand and obsolete material exposures. We offer a one-year warranty on all of our hardware products and a 90-day warranty against defects in any embedded software, and we use judgment and estimates when determining warranty costs based on historical costs to replace or repair product returns within the warranty period at the time we recognize revenue, accruing specifically identified reserves if and when we determine we have a systemic product failure. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we base estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, recognizing that different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which in turn could change the results from those reported.

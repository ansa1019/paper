Gilead continues to add to its existing portfolio of products through its internal discovery and clinical development programs and through a product acquisition and in-licensing strategy, striving to transform and simplify care and support business continuity under challenging conditions. We manage our research and development expenses by identifying the R&D activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources and other considerations, continually reviewing our pipeline and reallocating resources among our portfolio to support the future growth of our business. From a commercial perspective, we focus on supporting the uptake of our single tablet regimens, preparing for new product launches and building-out and expanding our international commercial infrastructure to enable operational flexibility and performance maintenance in response to environmental disruptions. We face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and use foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a percentage of our exposure as part of our risk mitigation strategy, and while growth from the launches of Sovaldi and Harvoni more than doubled our business in 2014, we anticipate future net product sales growth subject to uncertainties including macroeconomic pressures in Europe, volatility in exchange rates, changes in payer mix, discounts, chargebacks, rebates and regulatory approvals. We expect our product pipeline investments and expanding commercial infrastructure will enable us to execute on our operating objectives, and we believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash flows from operations and access to debt financing under our five-year revolving credit facility, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future, with all covenants met as of December 31, 2014. During 2014 we also deployed resources to settle convertible senior notes and related warrants and repurchased common stock under our stock repurchase programs to offset dilution, demonstrating our capacity to absorb financial strain and reconfigure resource deployment to maintain organizational strength. Our allowance methodologies for government and other rebates and chargebacks involve complex judgment, are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information, and have historically varied by less than 5% from actual, illustrating our systemic attention to risk assessment and adaptive correction. The acquisitions of Pharmasset in January 2012 and YM Biosciences in February 2013, financed through a combination of cash, debt issuances and bank debt, have reconstituted our R&D capabilities and enabled us to advance all-oral regimens for HCV, evidencing our ability to absorb strategic strain, reconfigure trajectories in immediate response to disruptive events and emerge stronger to pursue future objectives.

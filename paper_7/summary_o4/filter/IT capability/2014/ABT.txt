In response to challenging economic and fiscal conditions in several emerging economies and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, Abbott implemented manufacturing and distribution process changes, cost reduction and efficiency initiatives across its nutritional, diagnostics and vascular segments, driving operating margin improvements from 15.7 percent in 2012 to 21.0 percent in 2014 for nutritional products, from 19.2 percent to 22.9 percent for diagnostics and from 33.2 percent to 36.5 percent for vascular products. When a third-party-manufacturer product recall in August 2013 created significant disruption in international pediatric nutrition markets, Abbott initiated investments in the third quarter of 2013 to rebuild consumer confidence, and the business had recovered by the third quarter of 2014; concurrently, it increased its local presence by opening three new manufacturing plants in China, India and the United States and forming a strategic alliance to develop a proposed dairy farm hub in China. To enhance its systemic resilience and competitive position in key emerging markets, Abbott acquired controlling interests in CFR Pharmaceuticals S.A., more than doubling its branded generics presence in Latin America, and acquired Veropharm to establish a manufacturing footprint in Russia, while divesting its developed-markets branded generics and animal health businesses and effecting the separation of AbbVie to streamline operations and focus resources. The Company maintains rigorous risk-mitigation and resource-allocation practices, including quarterly and annual reviews of indefinite- and definite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment using discounted cash flow and fair value assessments, recording litigation loss contingencies in accordance with ASC 450 and adjusting rebate reserves based on historical trends and projected program changes, and employing internal and external tax and actuarial professionals to optimize income tax positions and pension obligations. Abbottâ€™s financial flexibility and capacity to absorb strain are further demonstrated by the early extinguishment of approximately $500 million of long-term debt assumed in the CFR acquisition, maintenance of a+ and A1 credit ratings and $5.0 billion of unused lines of credit, a $3.0 billion share repurchase authorization, a 40 percent increase in dividends and planned capital expenditures to upgrade and expand global infrastructure and next-generation platforms, all supported by transitional services agreements to ensure operational continuity during divisional separations and divestitures, thereby preserving or improving its functioning under internal or external pressures.

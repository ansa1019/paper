We operate in an environment characterized by increasing complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures, and a significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on disciplined program execution, improving the quality and predictability of our products and services, placing capability quickly into customers’ hands and pursuing affordability initiatives, while recognizing resource constraints and extending our portfolio into adjacent markets and international sales. We identify and monitor risks to technical, schedule and cost performance on long-term, highly complex contracts and adjust our profit booking rates as risks are retired or emerge, and we maintain a balanced cash deployment strategy—comprising capital expenditures, independent research and development, acquisitions, divestitures, internal realignments designed to leverage existing capabilities and enhance delivery, and disciplined debt and liquidity management—to preserve financial flexibility, support business continuity and position ourselves to seize new opportunities. Amid continued uncertainty from U.S. government budget reductions, sequestration, fragmented contract awards and competitive pressures, we have sought to align our businesses with critical national priorities, diversify beyond government dependence, restructure facilities and workforce to better align cost structures, recover environmental remediation and pension costs through pricing agreements, conduct quarterly reviews of environmental liabilities and recoverability, manage postretirement benefit plan funding and cas pension cost recoveries, and perform annual goodwill impairment tests of self-sustaining reporting units—such as our technical services and civil information systems units—to evaluate fair value under changing market conditions and thereby maintain organizational health, adaptability and resilience.

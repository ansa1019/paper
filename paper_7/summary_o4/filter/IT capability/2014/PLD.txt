Our competitive advantages stem from “the scale and quality of our operating platform, the skills of our team and the strength of our balance sheet,” enabling the organization to absorb strains such as market volatility and maintain continuity of operations. Management’s plan to grow revenue, earnings, net operating income (“NOI”), cash flows and core FFO is based on rising rents across many markets and value creation from development initiatives—supported by a land bank capable of nearly 180 million additional square feet and an expected post-stabilization value at completion approximately 23.0% above book value—thereby demonstrating operational flexibility, resource allocation and systemic perspective. Economies of scale from growth in assets under management allow increased real estate investments with minimal incremental general and administrative expenses, illustrating competitive advantage through efficient use of internal knowledge and resources. We consider our ability to generate cash from operating activities, dispositions of properties, contributions to co-investment ventures and available financing sources—including credit facility capacity of $2.7 billion, equity issuances under our ATM program and debt offerings—to be adequate to meet anticipated development, acquisition, operating, debt service, dividend and distribution requirements, underpinning business continuity, future orientation and strategic response under varying conditions. To mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure, we borrow in functional currencies, designate derivative instruments and remeasure third-party debt to reduce volatility and extend maturities via euro, yen and sterling notes, reflecting risk mitigation and adaptability to external disturbances. Our same-store analysis, which holds portfolio composition constant and removes the effects of currency fluctuations, supports performance maintenance under environmental perturbations and informs decision making. Active portfolio management—through acquisitions, dispositions, consolidation of NAIF and contributions of properties to ventures such as Fibra Prologis—illustrates reconfiguring of assets, inter-organizational collaboration and strategic agility in response to market disruptions. Critical accounting policies around purchase price allocation, impairment assessments and consolidation of variable interest entities provide organizational intelligence, rigorous impact assessment and resilience in financial reporting. Compliance with debt covenants, proactive refinancing of maturing obligations and strategic use of cash, debt repurchases and capital commitments demonstrate our capacity to foresee, confront and benefit from challenging conditions while preserving or improving functioning and firm performance.

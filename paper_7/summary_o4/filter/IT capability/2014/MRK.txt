Merck continued to execute a multi-year initiative to sharpen its commercial and research and development focus, redesign its operating model and reduce its cost base while remaining focused on innovation, including an intensified portfolio assessment process that divested non-core assets such as its consumer care business and certain ophthalmic products to better resource its core areas and return cash to shareholders. The company implemented global restructuring programs intended to streamline its cost structure, rationalize manufacturing and research sites, reduce workforce and real estate footprints, and yield multi-billion dollar annual net cost savings by 2015, thereby enhancing operational flexibility and resource reconfiguration. In response to heightened competitive pressures, regulatory constraints and health care cost-containment efforts, Merck continually evaluated, adapted and improved its organization and business practices to better meet customer needs, maintain business continuity and preserve performance under internal and external variations. Portfolio prioritization drove faster advancement of key clinical programs, accelerated out-licensing or discontinuation of select late-stage assets, and reinforced strategic agility through acquisitions and alliances—such as collaborations with Bayer, joint ventures, and the acquisitions of Idenix, OncoEthix and Cubist—that expanded its pipeline, enhanced inter-organizational collaboration and supplemented internal research with external knowledge. Financial resilience was supported by a strong liquidity position, conservative investment guidelines, diversified funding sources and comprehensive hedging of foreign exchange and interest-rate exposures, enabling the company to fund ongoing R&D, support in-line products and provide returns to shareholders. Operational preparedness and risk mitigation also included disciplined inventory and product-launch planning, maintenance of provisions for rebates and returns, active management of legal and environmental contingencies, and prudent pension and postretirement plan assumptions. Merck’s research and development model reflects a systemic perspective that targets resources on therapeutically differentiated candidates, leverages partnerships and licensing to absorb external innovation, and applies strategic planning and adaptive strategies to maintain organizational resilience in a complex, turbulent business environment.

In our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, the following discussion contains “forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs” and cautions that “our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements,” underscoring our preparation for uncertainty. We “evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis” and “make adjustments to these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate,” while we “record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated” and “review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions accordingly,” demonstrating systematic risk mitigation and operational continuity processes. Liquidity resilience is supported by a five-year, $6.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility “to fund working capital and general corporate purposes,” and we believe that “our available funds, credit facilities, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future.” Operational flexibility is further evidenced by strategic investments in data center and technical infrastructure—including the reversal of $34 million of lease abandonment expense in 2014 “due to our decision to re-occupy and utilize a previously exited data center”—by planned capital expenditures of $2.8 billion to $3.2 billion in 2015 and by expansion of engineering, sales, marketing, and administrative headcount to support user growth, product development, and global operations. We anticipate that “growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future” and that regional ARPU dynamics will shape revenue planning, reflecting our adaptive strategies to preserve performance under varying conditions.

Management’s strategies to maintain performance under challenging conditions include business strategies designed to build a portfolio that is balanced across geographies and categories to navigate short-term volatility and uncertainty; broaden the product portfolio with more nutritious offerings; adapt to changing customer channels by increasing e-commerce presence and leveraging the distribution system; and focus on multi-year productivity programs to strengthen manufacturing automation, optimize global manufacturing footprint, re-engineer go-to-market systems, expand shared services and simplify organizational structures. The company continues to embrace sustainable business practices across its supply chain, deploying innovative ways to conserve and replenish water, reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, promote sustainable agriculture and decrease waste to bolster supply continuity and resilience. To support organizational health and future orientation, management has invested in a globally integrated talent management infrastructure to systematically develop functional, technical and leadership skills. Financial and operational flexibility is reinforced through close monitoring of productivity savings, net capital spending and free cash flow, while market risks—commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate exposures—are managed with productivity initiatives, global purchasing agreements and derivative hedges. Under board oversight, an integrated risk management framework and cross-functional risk committees identify, assess, prioritize, address, manage, monitor and communicate strategic, financial, operating, business, compliance, safety, reputational and other risks, and management continues to monitor economic, operating and political environments in challenging markets to mitigate potential adverse impacts on results, thereby preserving integrity and functioning despite external disturbances.

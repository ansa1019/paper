Management notes that “Blackstone’s businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in the U.S., Europe, Asia and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere in the world,” observing “a sharp increase in volatility” late in 2014 even as “economic activity in the U.S. continued to strengthen.”  In real estate, they report that “real estate fundamentals appear healthy” and that “ongoing capital market dislocation across emerging markets in Asia has provided minimal liquidity for real estate owners and reduced financing for new construction.”  The firm “manages its business using traditional financial measures and key operating metrics” and “targets operating expense levels such that total management and advisory fees exceed total operating expenses each period,” ensuring resource sufficiency.  Liquidity resilience is maintained through “multiple sources of liquidity to meet our capital needs, including annual cash flows, accumulated earnings in the businesses, investments in our own treasury and liquid funds and access to our debt capacity,” with expectations to receive “cash generated from operating activities, carried interest and incentive income realizations, and realizations on the carry and hedge fund investments that we make.”  They caution that “prolonged periods of few substantial realizations from our investment funds accompanied by substantial capital calls” could adversely affect available capital and accordingly include fund commitments in “managing our overall liquidity and cash position.”  Primary liquidity needs are identified as cash “to facilitate the growth of our existing businesses,” complement expansion, “pay operating expenses,” “fund modest capital expenditures,” “repay borrowings and related interest costs,” “pay income taxes,” and “make distributions” to unitholders.  Strategic adaptation includes the “plan to spin off … financial and strategic advisory services … and combine these businesses with PJT Partners” and the opportunistic use of leverage “to create the most efficient capital structure.”  Operational flexibility and risk mitigation are further supported by off-balance sheet arrangements for “entering into derivative transactions,” “providing financial guarantees,” and agreeing to “indemnify” third-party service providers, while rigorous “critical accounting policies” require “assumptions, estimates and/or judgments” to be updated when “actual amounts … become known.”  This integrated approach to monitoring metrics, preserving liquidity, adapting organizational structure, deploying resources strategically and managing risk implicitly underpins Blackstone’s capacity to maintain performance and continuity under challenging economic conditions.

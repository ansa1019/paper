Mastercard presents non-GAAP financial measures to enhance an investorâ€™s evaluation of its ongoing operating results and to facilitate meaningful comparison of its results between periods, and its management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. Operating expenses increased primarily due to investments to support strategic initiatives, and acquisitions contributed six percentage points to operating expense growth in 2014. While the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries, the significant concentration of our revenue in the United States makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in that market, and Mastercard continues to monitor political and economic conditions around the world to identify opportunities for the continued growth of our business and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry. Although to date we have not experienced any material impacts from cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer such losses in the future, and we attempt to manage foreign currency exposures through our foreign exchange risk management activities. Our borrowings under the company's credit facility are available to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes, including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by the company's customers, and in March 2014 we issued notes and extended our committed revolving credit facility to ensure access to capital resources sufficient to satisfy future operating cash needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. During the fourth quarter of 2014 we implemented an initiative to better align our legal entity and tax structure with our operational footprint outside of the U.S., which we believe will result in greater flexibility and efficiency with regard to the global deployment of cash as well as ongoing benefits in our effective income tax rate. We guarantee the settlement of many Mastercard, Cirrus and Maestro-branded transactions between our issuers and acquirers, and although historical payments under these guarantees have not been significant, future losses may be driven by regional or global economic conditions. Critical accounting estimates, including assumptions used in revenue recognition, accruals for loss contingencies related to legal and regulatory proceedings and the valuation of assets acquired in business combinations, require significant judgment, are subject to periodic review and adjustment and reflect our policies and control procedures to ensure consistency in estimates and assumptions that directly affect our reported financial condition.

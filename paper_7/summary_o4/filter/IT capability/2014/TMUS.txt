Management’s discussion highlights the company’s capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning under competitive, technological and regulatory pressures by adopting its “un-carrier” proposition—an adaptive framework that seeks to “listen to the customer, address their pain points, bring innovation to the industry, and improve the wireless experience for all”—and by continuously refining service offerings through phased initiatives such as contract freedom, test drive, music freedom, Wi-Fi unleashed and data stash.  In practice, this has involved resource reconfiguration, including reimbursing early termination fees, deferring revenues to support handset trade-in guarantees, building out a nationwide LTE network while decommissioning redundant CDMA assets, and expanding spectrum holdings to enhance system integrity and performance under environmental perturbations.  To mitigate financial risks and maintain continuity, the company employs diversified liquidity tools—cash from operations, long-term debt and equity issuances, a two-year factoring arrangement for service receivables and vendor payment financing—and dynamically reviews forecasts of operating results, capital requirements and market conditions, while remaining in compliance with restrictive debt covenants.  Strategic foresight is further demonstrated by planned capital expenditures of $4.4–$4.7 billion in 2015 for network modernization, opportunistic spectrum acquisitions pending regulatory approval, and robust risk-assessment processes—including annual impairment testing of goodwill and spectrum licenses, periodic remeasurement of asset useful lives and allowances for credit losses on installment receivables—that collectively support the maintenance of positive adjustment, operational flexibility and performance maintenance in the face of adversity.

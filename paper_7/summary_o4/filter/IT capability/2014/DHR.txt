Danaher’s MD&A discloses that as a diversified global business, its geographic and industry diversity and broad range of products typically help limit the impact of any one industry or country economy on consolidated operating results, demonstrating resilience to regional economic and political perturbations. Management monitors key competitors and customers, including their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future, reflecting a systemic perspective and future orientation. The company faces external pressures such as rapid technological development, expansion in high-growth markets, labor cost trends, industry consolidation and increasing regulation, and it identifies that its long-term growth and profitability will depend on its ability to expand in high-growth geographies, identify, consummate and integrate acquisitions, develop innovative and differentiated new products, expand and improve the effectiveness of its sales force, continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality, and effectively address regulatory demands, all of which constitute dynamic capabilities and strategic adaptation mechanisms. To support business continuity and responsiveness to customer needs, Danaher is making significant investments, both organically and through acquisitions, to globalize manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources worldwide in order to be responsive to customers throughout the world and improve operational efficiency. In the second half of 2014 the company initiated restructuring actions to improve productivity and reduce costs, resulting in pre-tax charges of approximately $155 million and expected savings of approximately $125 million in 2015, underscoring its process of resource reconfiguration under challenging conditions. Acquisitions of Nobel Biocare and sixteen additional businesses in 2014, financed from available cash, and the divestiture of its electric vehicle systems/hybrid product line, illustrate strategic portfolio reconfiguration to preserve or improve functioning and enhance competitive advantage. The company’s liquidity and capital resources section emphasizes its ability to generate cash from operations and to access liquidity through an unsecured $2.5 billion revolving credit facility and commercial paper programs—thereby mitigating interest rate and currency exchange risks and ensuring financial continuity. Operating cash flows increased by 5% year-over-year, driven by higher net earnings, depreciation and amortization, and investments in working capital management, while capital expenditures—expected to be $650 million to $700 million in 2015—support capacity expansion, technology investment and customer-leased assets, illustrating its capacity to absorb strain while investing for future growth. Danaher also describes its approach to risk management across currency exchange, interest rate, credit, equity price and commodity price exposures without extensive use of derivative hedging, underpinned by a broad-based operating model that reduces volatility in operating profit. By maintaining rigorous working capital management, pension funding, disciplined debt maturity management and oversight of taxes and contingent liabilities, the company demonstrates organizational flexibility, resourcefulness and the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

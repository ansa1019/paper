On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, cash equivalents and marketable securities, stock-based compensation and litigation, investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies, basing our judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities; we defer recognition of revenue for distributor arrangements with rights of return and account for rebates and marketing development funds as reductions of revenue to support partner activities while managing uncertainty in demand; inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis with provisions to write down excess or obsolete inventory to the lower of cost or estimated market value based on our inventory levels, future product purchase commitments, assumptions about future demand and market conditions, and potential competitive pricing actions; as a fabless semiconductor company we make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand and third-party manufacturing constraints, adjusting to market factors, product transitions and macroeconomic conditions; goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value using both income and market approaches, reconciling combined fair value estimates to market capitalization and considering downside scenarios to ensure performance maintenance under adverse conditions; cash equivalents and marketable securities are measured at fair value and classified by input level, with all available-for-sale investments subject to periodic impairment review and recognition of other-than-temporary impairments when fair value is significantly below cost basis; our investment policy requires the purchase of high-grade investment securities, diversification of asset types, limits on portfolio duration and credit exposure, and periodic fair value and impairment reviews to preserve liquidity and organizational flexibility; we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from customer payment defaults and manage cash balances held inside and outside the United States to balance repatriation tax considerations with operational continuity, supplemented by access to external sources of financing if needed; share repurchase authorizations and our cash dividend program, along with projected capital expenditures of $150.0 million to $200.0 million for fiscal year 2016, demonstrate adaptive capital deployment to meet operating, acquisition, share repurchase, cash dividend and capital requirements; and our stock-based compensation, litigation and tax strategies incorporate estimates of forfeitures, potential liabilities and performance incentives, all designed to absorb strain, adapt to disruptions and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

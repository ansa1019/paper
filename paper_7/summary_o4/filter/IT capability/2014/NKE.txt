Nike’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis outlines a comprehensive approach to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions by driving operational excellence and resource reconfiguration across its global portfolio. The company seeks to make its supply chain a competitive advantage by reducing product costs through manufacturing efficiency, product design innovation, and a centrally managed foreign currency adjustment program that absorbs currency fluctuations. It improves working-capital efficiency by managing inventory reserves, accounts receivable allowances, and contingent endorsement contract obligations, and deploys capital effectively through share repurchases, disciplined dividend increases, and use of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and a committed one-billion-dollar credit facility. Despite significant foreign currency headwinds and persistent macroeconomic uncertainty, Nike delivered record revenues and earnings per share in fiscal 2014 by executing its category-offense strategy—fueled by proprietary technology platforms and deep brand connections—and by expanding its direct-to-consumer operations through new stores and accelerated e-commerce growth. A centrally managed foreign-exchange risk management program leverages natural offsets, forward contracts, and options to mitigate translational and transactional exposures, while hedges of net investments and cash flows help preserve consolidated results. Concurrent investments in digital capabilities and corporate infrastructure, together with robust critical accounting policies for revenue recognition, long-lived asset impairment testing, and contingent liability assessment, underpin Nike’s systemic capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning in the face of external pressures, environmental perturbations, and financial market volatility.

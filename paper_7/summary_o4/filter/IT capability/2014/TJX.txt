In fiscal 2015 we continued to generate strong cash flows, allowing us to return value to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases while reinvesting in our business by adding new stores, remodeling existing ones and strengthening our infrastructure to support our next level of growth, thereby deploying financial resources and maintaining operational flexibility under varying conditions. We routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases, preserving performance under external disturbances. Our disciplined management of working capital, including the timing of receipt and payment of merchandise purchases, together with internally generated funds supplemented as needed by short-term bank borrowings and commercial paper, has supported business continuity and liquidity adequacy. We maintain a reserve for former operations to address future lease obligations and other liabilities arising from closed stores, reflecting proactive risk assessment and mitigation processes. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 are planned at approximately $975 million, including investments in offices, distribution centers, buying and merchandising systems and information systems to support growth, store renovations and new store openings, and will be funded through internally generated funds. We have entered into a lease agreement for the construction and occupancy of a new home office facility in Canada, reflecting strategic resource allocation toward infrastructure enhancement. We manage our capital structure through the issuance and redemption of debt securities, repurchase of common stock, payment of quarterly dividends and maintenance of credit facilities to ensure adequate capital resourcesâ€”planning to repurchase $1.8 to $1.9 billion of stock in fiscal 2016 and target a 20 percent increase in dividends. Our cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 billion held outside the U.S., with deferred U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings, are managed to support indefinite reinvestment and liquidity. We believe that our existing cash and credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year, demonstrating our capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning under internal and external variations.

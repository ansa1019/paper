During 2014, the company strengthened its continuous improvement and safety culture through multi-faceted risk-assessment and mitigation initiatives—such as “courage to care,” “total safety culture” and Up Way—yielding record-low personal injury and derailment rates and informing new at-grade crossing prevention approaches for 2015, thereby sustaining operational integrity under adverse events. Its 2015 capital plan, expected at approximately $4.3 billion, combines targeted asset renewal, network capacity expansion and technology investments (including positive train control) with flexible funding sources—operating cash flows, receivables securitization, revolving credit, debt issuance and property dispositions—to ensure resource availability and business continuity amid evolving regulatory and market conditions. Liquidity management balances a $1.7 billion committed credit facility and a $650 million receivables securitization program, which support commercial paper issuance as an emergency buffer and safeguard access to capital markets against internal or external pressures. Productivity and margin-enhancement efforts leverage pricing opportunities and network fluidity to offset cost inflation, while network operations establish surge capability to adapt to volume growth and severe weather disruptions. Proactive risk management extends to environmental remediation, personal injury and asbestos liabilities, where actuarial analyses inform reserve funding, and to financial hedging of interest rate and fuel-price volatility, preserving system performance under perturbations. Labor relations under the Railway Labor Act are managed to avoid work stoppages, contributing to organizational continuity, and critical accounting judgments—asset life depreciation, pension and postretirement benefit assumptions—are systematically reviewed to reflect changing conditions and support strategic decision-making.

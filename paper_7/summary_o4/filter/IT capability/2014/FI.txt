Management’s discussion and analysis describes a series of strategic initiatives—active portfolio management, disciplined allocation of capital, improved operational effectiveness and differentiation through innovation—designed to absorb strain from industry consolidation, regulatory pressures and economic variability and to preserve or enhance enterprise performance under varying conditions. The recurring nature of 83% of revenue from account- and transaction-based fees under long-term, non-discretionary contracts with high renewal rates provides a stable foundation that supports business continuity and operational resilience amid market volatility. Scale efficiencies and operational-effectiveness initiatives drove a reduction in the cost of processing and services as a percentage of revenue to 51.3% in 2014 from 52.9% in 2012, while operating leverage in recurring revenue businesses, together with cost-structure improvements, mitigated the impact of integration costs and external cost fluctuations such as increased postage pass-through expenses. The acquisition of Open Solutions, funded through available cash and existing availability under our revolving credit facility, expanded our real-time account processing capabilities and client base, illustrating our capacity to reconfigure resource portfolios, integrate disparate systems and maintain operational continuity. Our sizable and diverse client base—spanning the entire range of financial institutions and with our 50 largest clients representing less than 25% of revenue—combined with integration of products and services, amplifies our systemic perspective and absorptive capacity, enabling us to anticipate, confront and benefit from disruptive trends such as digital channel adoption and regulatory change. Our policy of deploying operating cash flow primarily toward debt repayment, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, together with liquidity provided by cash, cash equivalents and a disciplined revolving credit facility and term loan with restrictive covenants, ensures our ability to maintain financial flexibility, strategic foresight and future orientation under both nominal and adverse conditions.

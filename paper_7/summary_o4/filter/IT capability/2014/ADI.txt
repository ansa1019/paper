On July 22, 2014, we completed the $2.4 billion acquisition of Hittite Microwave Corporation, recognizing $1.4 billion of goodwill and $666 million of intangible assets and financing the purchase with existing cash and a 90-day term loan facility that was repaid in full, illustrating our ability to reconfigure financial and operational resources in response to strategic opportunities.  We monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis, and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues, having undertaken restructuring actions since fiscal 2008 that included facility closures, workforce reductions, lease obligations costs and asset impairments and resulted in estimated annual cost savings of approximately $46.2 million in fiscal 2014, which we expect to use to make additional investments in products that will drive future revenue growth.  We maintain $2.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which $856.5 million is held in the United States and the balance is held in various foreign subsidiaries, and we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, dividend payments and share repurchases for at least the next twelve months.  We maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk.  Working capital management actions included the deferral of revenue on shipments to distributors until products are sold to end customers in order to mitigate uncertainty arising from price-adjustment credits and returns, inventory adjustments that decreased days cost of sales in inventory to 102 days due to a $53.6 million write-up of acquired inventory, and consistent days in sales outstanding despite higher year-end shipments.  On balance sheet governance, we ensure compliance with covenants under our unsecured revolving credit facility and senior notes, maintain an undrawn $500 million credit line, and manage deferred compensation and pension funding in accordance with plan requirements and market conditions.  Our common stock repurchase program, under which we have repurchased approximately 137 million shares for $4.8 billion since 2004 with $748.2 million remaining, and our declaration of quarterly dividends of $0.37 per share, reflect our commitment to balance shareholder returns with the preservation of financial flexibility.  We continue to refine our processes for revenue classification, data capture and reclassification of prior-period amounts by end market and product category to ensure the integrity of reported trends, and we are evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on our revenue recognition policies to further enhance the transparency, consistency and resilience of our financial reporting framework.

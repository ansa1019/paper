We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, recognizing that actual results could differ materially under different assumptions or conditions; on a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates and discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee to preserve organizational functioning under uncertainty. We have transformed our business model through adoption of Creative Cloud, driving our revenue to be more recurring and predictable, enabling larger customer engagements, more predictable revenue as well as higher long-term revenue growth, and we continue to implement strategies—such as increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, targeted promotions and exclusive delivery of new product innovations—to accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase and thereby expand our customer base and secure resilience against market shifts. We recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of agreements and define creative ARR and document services ARR as performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our overall digital media segment, adjusting ARR for material exchange rate changes, and in our Adobe Marketing Cloud segment strong execution and customer demand have accelerated term-based adoption of AEM and Adobe Campaign, resulting in larger customer engagements, more predictable revenue as well as higher long-term revenue growth. We expect subscription revenue will continue to increase as a result of our investments in new SaaS and subscription models, thereby increasing the amount of recurring revenue we generate as a percent of total revenue and enhancing business continuity. Our risk mitigation and resource-allocation strategies include a currency hedging program to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency impact to revenue, an available $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolver for liquidity, interest rate lock agreements and planned refinancings of maturing senior notes to ensure sufficient resources to meet working capital and operating expenditure requirements, and structured stock repurchase agreements that enable us to repurchase shares at a guaranteed discount when the discount exceeds the foregone return on our prepayments. During fiscal 2014 we recorded restructuring charges associated with termination benefits and closing redundant facilities under our fiscal 2014 restructuring plan to right-size our cost structure, and we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, cash generated from operations and available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our resource needs for the next twelve months. In connection with business combinations, we allocate purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values at the acquisition date, requiring management to make significant estimates and assumptions and acknowledging that unanticipated events and circumstances may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and in our annual goodwill impairment test we estimate future revenue, consider market factors and estimate future cash flows, recognizing that different assumptions, judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results—all reflecting our dynamic capabilities to absorb strain and maintain or improve performance despite internal and external disturbances.

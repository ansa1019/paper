Stryker’s 2014 Form 10-K MD&A highlights several organizational practices that support resilience by preserving functionality and adaptability under diverse internal and external pressures. The company maintains separate dedicated sales forces for each principal product line and sells products in over 100 countries through a combination of company-owned subsidiaries, branches and third-party distributors to ensure operational flexibility and business continuity across regions. In July 2014, Stryker established a European regional headquarters in the Netherlands to strengthen its brand in Europe, support global growth, enhance operational efficiencies and simplify customer experience, illustrating a systemic perspective on resource deployment and strategic adaptation. Stryker underscores its commitment to internal innovation and service improvement through continued investment in research, development and engineering—representing 6.3% of sales in 2014—and through focused acquisitions totaling $916 million, thereby reconfiguring resources to absorb strain from competitive and market disruptions and to drive future performance. The company’s capital allocation strategy prioritizes acquisitions and share repurchases, and it leverages substantial operating cash flow supplemented by debt financing as needed, reflecting agile resource generation and risk mitigation capabilities. Stryker’s proactive management of product liability contingencies—including a settlement agreement to compensate patients for recall-related revision surgeries and accruals for probable losses—demonstrates crisis response mechanisms and the maintenance of organizational integrity under adverse conditions. A global cash management strategy that addresses liquidity, economic factors and tax considerations, together with active monitoring of receivables in Southern Europe, evidences an organizational health–oriented approach to potential credit strains. Finally, the use of designated and non-designated forward currency exchange contracts and hedge accounting to limit the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on intercompany transactions exemplifies resilience through financial risk management and the preservation of performance under environmental perturbations.

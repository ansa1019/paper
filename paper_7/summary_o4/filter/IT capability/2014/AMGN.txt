Amgen’s management’s discussion and analysis describes forward‐looking statements that acknowledge risks, uncertainties and assumptions affecting future performance, and outlines a strategy for long-term growth centered on the discovery, development, manufacturing and delivery of innovative therapies, global expansion, next-generation biologics production and the return of capital to shareholders to sustain operational flexibility and resource deployment. During 2014, Amgen announced a restructuring plan to reduce its staff by 3,500–4,000 and its facilities footprint by approximately 23% by the end of 2015, thereby improving cost structure and reallocating resources to continuing innovation and new pipeline launches. Concurrently, the company is advancing key initiatives to streamline processes, increase agility and efficiencies, and enhance operating performance through improved contracting and sourcing, rationalized discretionary spending, greater use of shared services and optimized research and development efficiency. In addition, completion of a next-generation biomanufacturing facility in Singapore is expected to increase productivity at lower capital and operating costs, reflecting a systemic perspective on capacity expansion and risk mitigation. To manage financial and market volatility, Amgen employs foreign currency and interest-rate hedging strategies, cross-currency swap contracts and maintains a $2.5 billion commercial paper program and a revolving credit facility, ensuring adequate liquidity alongside approximately $27 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, most of which is deployed indefinitely outside the United States. The company closely monitors global economic conditions—particularly payment timing from government healthcare providers in southern Europe—and adjusts its working capital and credit arrangements accordingly. Critical accounting policies governing accruals for rebates, chargebacks and returns, valuation of acquired intangible assets and contingent consideration, and impairment assessments for long-lived and in-process R&D assets illustrate Amgen’s structured approach to risk assessment, resource allocation and the maintenance of organizational integrity and performance under varying internal and external pressures.

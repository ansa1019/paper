During 2014, NEE and its subsidiaries implemented initiatives determined during a 2013 enterprise-wide process focused mainly on improving productivity and reducing O&M expenses, and FPL placed in service the 1,212 MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle Riviera Beach power plant, began construction on the Port Everglades modernization project and obtained Florida Public Service Commission approval to invest in Woodford shale natural gas supplies and recover costs through the fuel clause, thereby reinforcing operational continuity under varying conditions. NEER added approximately 1,217 MW of wind capacity and 265 MW of solar capacity, increased its backlog of contracted renewable development projects and completed project acquisitions to secure stable long-term cash flows through its limited partnership interest in NEP Opco. As of December 31, 2014, NEE’s total net available liquidity was approximately $7.0 billion, of which FPL’s portion was $2.1 billion, supported by bank revolving credit facilities aggregating $7.85 billion and letters of credit to support operating facilities—including transmission and distribution property loss—and to absorb up to $122 million of storm restoration costs without immediate regulatory filings, illustrating financial resilience and emergency management funding mechanisms. NEE and NEER employ derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk—segregating non-qualifying hedges and trading activities—and use a value-at-risk model to assess market exposures, while interest rate swaps and cash flow hedges mitigate variability in debt servicing and master netting agreements, credit limits and collateral practices control counterparty credit risk; stress tests, including hypothetical 10 percent shifts in interest rates or equity prices, gauge sensitivity under disruptive scenarios. Compliance with Dodd-Frank reporting requirements, oversight by an exposure management committee, continuous monitoring of credit ratings—with no downgrade triggers that accelerate debt maturities—and regulatory accounting treatments, such as cost recovery clauses, reserve amortization and nuclear decommissioning funding, all reflect a multifaceted approach to absorbing strain, preserving performance and adapting to regulatory, market and environmental perturbations.

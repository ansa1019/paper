In fiscal 2014, in response to a breach of our payment data systems that potentially impacted customers, our investigation determined that an intruder used a vendor’s credentials to deploy unique, custom-built malware on self-checkout systems accessing payment card information of up to 56 million customers, and on September 18, 2014 we confirmed that the malware had been eliminated from our systems; we are supporting law enforcement efforts, have recorded $63 million of pretax expenses related to the data breach (partially offset by $30 million of expected insurance proceeds), and maintained $100 million of network security and privacy liability insurance coverage (above a $7.5 million deductible), renewing in fiscal 2015 with similar terms to limit our exposure to similar losses. In September 2014 we completed a major payment security project providing enhanced encryption of payment card data at the point of sale in all U.S. stores, commenced rolling out enhanced encryption to our Canadian stores and EMV chip-and-pin technology in U.S. stores, thereby scrambling raw payment card information to make it unreadable to unauthorized users. We anticipate future costs related to the data breach will include legal and professional fees, reimbursements to payment card networks for fraud and card reissuance expenses, liabilities from civil litigation, governmental investigations and enforcement proceedings, and incremental expenses and capital investments for remediation activities; we will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and record loss estimates when both probable and reasonably estimable, and we believe the ultimate amount paid on these services and claims could be material to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Liquidity and capital resources are supported by $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, access to long-term debt capital markets, up to $2.0 billion of commercial paper programs backed by a credit facility, and cash flow from operations, which we believe are sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to complete capital expenditure programs, dividend payments, share repurchases, obligations incurred from the data breach and required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. Our key initiatives in fiscal 2014 included a customer service program anchored on simplifying the business and creating an emotional connection with customers, highlighted by the rollout of our second-generation First Phone handheld mobile tool with integrated mobile checkout and improved processing speed; a product authority initiative facilitated by merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy focused on delivering product innovation, assortment and value through new merchandising assortment planning and pricing tools that better match assortments to local customer preferences, regulations and demographics; and disciplined capital allocation, productivity and efficiency achieved through continuous operational improvement in stores and the supply chain, strong expense controls, 80 million shares repurchased for $7.0 billion and a 26% increase in the quarterly cash dividend. To further enhance supply chain capabilities and product offerings, we acquired HD Supply Hardware Solutions in January 2015 and opened new stores in Mexico and Canada, generating $8.2 billion of cash flow from operations that funded share repurchases, dividends, capital expenditures and the acquisition. Our interconnected retail strategy connects all commerce channels across these initiatives, and in fiscal 2014 we enhanced our website and mobile experience—resulting in increased traffic, higher online sales conversion rates and growth in buy-online, pick-up-in-store (BOPIS) and buy-online, ship-to-store (BOSS) orders (nearly 40% of online orders), piloted buy-online, deliver-from-store (BODFS) and opened two of three planned direct fulfillment centers that balance cost efficiency and speed to meet customer needs. We manage market risk through interest rate swap agreements that, along with our debt issuances, result in approximately 90% fixed-rate and 10% floating-rate debt, and maintain self-insurance programs for general liability, workers’ compensation and employee medical claims with defined retention limits and actuarial estimates. Operational resilience is further supported by inventory controls—merchandise inventories stated at the lower of cost or market with approximately 74% under the retail inventory method, independent physical and cycle counts, shrink estimates based on historical results—and by vendor allowances accrued over incentive periods and applied against inventory or SG&A. We evaluate long-lived assets quarterly for impairment at the individual store level by comparing undiscounted cash flows to carrying values, recognize lease obligation costs on store closings and relocations, perform annual qualitative and quantitative goodwill recoverability assessments and amortize other intangible assets over estimated useful lives, ensuring our asset base remains aligned with changing operating and market conditions.

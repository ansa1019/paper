Visa regularly evaluates cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures and believes that projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet its needs for more than the next 12 months, as its treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk, ensure timely completion of payment settlement activities and fund required litigation settlements. The company has a commercial paper program to support working capital requirements and an unsecured $3.0 billion revolving credit facility under which no borrowings were outstanding and with all covenants in compliance, and maintains a litigation escrow account under the retrospective responsibility plan, reflected as restricted cash, from which covered litigation liabilities will be payable. Visa’s risk mitigation strategies include a hedging program to continue to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk, policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment, and global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral. The company’s sustained business continuity and operational flexibility are supported by continued investments in infrastructure, technology and network processing to support global growth initiatives, increased capital expenditures in fiscal 2014 and ongoing investments in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support its digital solutions and core business initiatives, as well as indemnification arrangements for settlement losses and proactive planning for potential Visa Europe put option obligations, thereby preserving system integrity and maintaining performance under varying contingencies. Visa also sponsors qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans funded on a current basis and anticipates contributions of approximately $10 million in fiscal 2015 to preserve employee benefits under changing actuarial and market conditions.

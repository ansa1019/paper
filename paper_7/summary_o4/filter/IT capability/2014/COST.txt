We have historically adapted our business to external pressures—such as fluctuations in currency exchange rates, changes in gasoline costs and competitive conditions—through strategic adjustments to pricing and merchandise mix, including increased penetration of private label items, thereby preserving and enhancing performance under varying market conditions; we leverage investments in modernizing information systems to improve operational flexibility and system integrity, and we allocate resources to maintain employee compensation above industry averages—absorbing costs that other employers might pass through—to reduce turnover and sustain organizational health; our primary sources of liquidity—cash flows from warehouse operations, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and committed bank credit and letter of credit facilities—are managed to ensure business continuity and preparedness for capital requirements; we maintain proactive risk assessment and mitigation through critical accounting estimates in revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation under LIFO/FIFO with quarterly adjustments, impairment testing of long-lived assets, assessment of insurance and self-insurance liabilities via captive and reinsurance arrangements, and evaluation of uncertain tax positions; our membership fee model defers revenue recognition ratably over the membership period while incorporating a 2% executive reward program accounted for as a liability based on redemption probabilities; we review investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment and adjust cost bases accordingly; we plan and execute systematic warehouse expansion and remodeling—including higher rates of square footage growth in foreign markets and the opening of new depots—to reconfigure our asset base and pursue growth amid environmental perturbations, thereby reinforcing our capacity to absorb strain and maintain performance under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

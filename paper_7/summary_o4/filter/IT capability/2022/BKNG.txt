In response to the significant decline in travel activity and consumer demand driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated government-imposed travel restrictions, the Company absorbed material strain while maintaining core operations by managing elevated cancellation rates through flexible policies, adjusting marketing spend and channels to preserve performance, and leveraging improvements in cancellation trends as restrictions eased to sustain cash flow and marketing efficiency. From the second quarter of 2020 through 2022, Booking demonstrated operational flexibility and recovery in accommodation room nights—reflecting its ability to absorb external pressures and preserve functionality under extreme conditions—by aligning resource allocation with regional travel patterns, vaccination progress, and the easing of travel restrictions. The Company’s long-term trajectory model of resilience emphasizes relentless innovation and service reconfiguration, exemplified by its “connected trip” strategy, which integrates modular elements of travel to deliver tailored and flexible consumer experiences, even at the expense of near-term margin pressures. To reinforce continuity and competitiveness, Booking has restructured its payment processing model toward a merchant basis—investing in personnel, payment infrastructure, fraud prevention, and call-center capacities—while maintaining substantial cash and liquid investments, hedging foreign currency exposure through derivatives, and preserving access to a $2 billion revolving credit facility to ensure liquidity under varying market conditions. Concurrently, the Company continues to invest in technology platforms, cloud computing and software maintenance, pursue strategic acquisitions (such as the proposed etraveli transaction), and reconfigure real estate assets via sale-leaseback of its future headquarters, thereby reallocating resources to strengthen resilience, support long-term growth, and adapt to evolving regulatory, tax, and economic uncertainties.

In our risk management and operations planning, we continuously monitor macroeconomic, geopolitical and regulatory developments, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, COVID-19 pandemic and foreign currency fluctuations, assessing their direct and indirect impacts on business continuity, customer needs and financial results; we demonstrated adaptive capacity by halting new sales in Russia and Belarus and adjusting our annualized recurring revenue by $87 million to preserve integrity under adverse conditions while continuing to provide services in Ukraine; our subscription-based business model provides predictable revenue streams that enable us to absorb external shocks and allocate resources effectively; we employ a data-driven operating model and leverage our Adobe Experience Cloud to integrate internal and external knowledge, optimize customer journeys and reinforce our systemic perspective across digital media and digital experience segments; we make regular assumptions, judgments and estimates based on historical experience and market conditions, continuously evaluating and adjusting them to align with evolving circumstances; significant investments in research and development, infrastructure and strategic acquisitions—including a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, non-cancellable hosting and data center commitments of $6.09 billion and structured and accelerated share repurchase programs—illustrate our resource deployment and operational flexibility; and we maintain liquidity through cash, investments and undrawn credit lines to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements, ensuring system resilience, maintaining integrity of operations and positioning the company to respond to and recover from disruptive events while delivering competitive advantage and preserving organizational health.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company modified employee work locations, transitioned to a hybrid on-site and remote model and continues to evaluate and refine its return-to-workplace strategy to preserve operational continuity under adverse conditions. Acknowledging heightened global economic and political uncertainty from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and associated sanctions, the Company noted its inability to predict the full impact on demand, customer and partner operations, governmental actions and broader macroeconomic conditions. Approval as a non-bank Small Business Administration lender under the Paycheck Protection Program illustrates its reconfiguration of resources to support small businesses during crisis. The Company has committed significant investments in product development, marketing, sales capabilities and information technology infrastructure, and in its privacy and security capabilities—including achievement of ISO 27001 certification, implementation of additional security measures and collaboration with state and federal governments on anti-fraud initiatives—to mitigate risks, maintain system integrity and ensure the ongoing availability of its online platforms and those of its external service providers. Recognizing the dynamic, AI-driven competitive landscape, emerging disruptive entrants and shifting customer expectations, the Company emphasized sustaining platform resilience and service delivery. Adaptations to seasonal revenue recognition in response to IRS deadline extensions further demonstrate its capacity to adjust performance trajectories under variable conditions, and its MD&A disclosures underscore ongoing forward-looking assessments of risks, uncertainties and resilience strategies.

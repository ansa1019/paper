The company’s discussion of forward-looking statements and risk factors underscores a formal approach to risk mitigation and business continuity management by acknowledging that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in research and development and capital infrastructure. It further notes that anticipated cash flows from operations, together with existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, are expected to support operations, investments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, capital redistributions and dividends for at least the next twelve months, while also recognizing that uncertainty in the global economy and the semiconductor industry, together with disruptions in credit markets, have in the past, and could in the future, impact customer demand and its ability to manage relationships with customers, suppliers and creditors. The customer support business group’s focus on maximizing installed equipment performance, predictability and operational efficiency, combined with cycles of learning from a broad installed base and collaborative engagement with semi-ecosystem partners, reflects organizational learning, inter-organizational collaboration and resource allocation aimed at preserving or improving functioning under external pressures. The company continued to make significant R&D investments in leading-edge deposition, etch and clean processes and to allocate resources across its product portfolio to meet technology inflections, demonstrating adaptability and strategic agility in the face of evolving market volatility and technical challenges. During fiscal year 2022, it responded to ongoing supply chain constraints and inflationary cost pressures by implementing improvements in its own operations and those of its suppliers, while acknowledging that such pressures are likely to persist, thereby reflecting a systemic perspective on disturbances and a capacity for partial maintenance of performance under sustained adversity. The company also maintains strategic flexibility in its financing activities, including access to capital markets, and manages contractual obligations under long-term debt, operating and finance leases and off-balance-sheet purchase commitments, all of which underscore proactive measures to preserve organizational flexibility, system integrity and resilience under challenging conditions.

In our forward-looking strategy, we seek to deliver an exceptional, differentiated customer experience by enhancing our foundational capabilities, evolving and growing our core businesses, and pursuing growth via adjacencies, thereby reinforcing our ability to maintain performance under changing conditions. We are striving to meet or exceed our organic revenue growth and EBITA margin targets, realize our merger and integration commitments—including cost and revenue synergy targets—and drive growth and superior shareholder returns through effective execution, active portfolio management and prudent capital allocation. Our “customer at the core” initiative focuses on enhancing customer support and seamless user experience with an emphasis on ease of discoverability, distribution, delivery and integrated capabilities, and continuing to invest in customer-facing solutions and processes. Our data and technology priorities include the efficient integration, accessibility and governance of enterprise data assets—initially sustainability data—through the formation of a data council to drive enterprise value creation, advancing our transition in technology spend toward higher-growth innovation via key spend benchmarks and a three-year plan, and maintaining momentum in transitioning all products and services to a cloud-based ecosystem aligned to customer needs. We continue to improve diverse representation through hiring, advancement and retention; ensure our people are engaged with a particular focus on learning, development and career opportunities; and embed our purpose and values throughout the company, all with the aim of preserving organizational health and adaptability. We drive a continuous commitment to risk management, compliance and control across S&P Global, recognizing that prolonged difficulties in global credit markets or shifts in regulation could unfavorably impact our operating results, and we maintain a strong financial position supported by cash from operations, liquidity under our credit facility and diversified use of cash for ongoing investments, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends, debt repayment, capital expenditures and infrastructure investment. Our merger with IHS Markit has brought together two organizations uniquely positioned to serve and power the markets of the future, and we have reconfigured our reportable segments to six to better allocate resources, improve operational flexibility and capture synergy. During 2022, we completed several dispositions that generated $1.9 billion of pre-tax gains, and we recorded merger-related costs and consolidation-driven efficiencies that, together with lower incentive and occupancy costs and higher compensation and technology expenses, reflect our continual reconfiguration of cost structures and resource deployment. We further expanded inter-organizational collaboration through our 50/50 joint venture with CME Group, OSTTRA, combining post-trade services and risk mitigation operations to increase operating efficiencies and better service clients across multiple asset classes. We continually assess our allowance for doubtful accounts, recognizing uncertainty in receivables collectability, and we evaluate long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets for impairment under varying cash-flow forecasts and discount rates, ensuring we preserve system integrity and performance under internal and external disturbances. Our pension and postretirement plans are funded and managed according to actuarial assumptions for compensation increases, discount rates and expected returns, and we maintain appropriate unrecognized tax benefit reserves and accrued liabilities for contingencies, all of which support our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity.

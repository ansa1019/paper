During 2022, the company confronted a range of internal and external disturbances—including global inflation, rising interest rates, recessionary forecasts, labor market pressures, geopolitical uncertainties, foreign currency fluctuations and COVID-19 lockdowns affecting manufacturing and supply chains—that disrupted service demand and increased operating costs, yet through disciplined capital allocation and strategic execution it maintained operational continuity and generated strong cash flows; it combined its integrated global network with enhanced digital capabilities to drive new services, productivity initiatives and network optimization, retired $2.0 billion of debt, reinvested in automation, technology and facility expansion (including sustainability projects exceeding $1.0 billion), and returned cash to shareowners via dividends and share repurchases, while expanding digital delivery solutions and cold-chain logistics through acquisitions that did not materially impair performance; to mitigate rate, currency and fuel‐price volatility it applies indexed fuel surcharges, formulates currency-neutral non-GAAP measures and adjusts its domestic and international package operations—including the suspension and orderly wind-down of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine activities—to adapt to volume declines and evolving risks; it preserves liquidity and system resilience with $7.6 billion in cash and marketable securities, committed credit facilities, supply chain finance programs and forward purchases of aircraft, vehicles, equipment and real estate for replacement and growth; and it supports performance maintenance under pressure by rigorously applying risk‐management processes—such as actuarial self-insurance reserves, defined benefit pension and postretirement medical benefit valuations, impairment testing of long-lived assets, and fair value measurements—all of which reflect its capacity to absorb strain, preserve integrity and adapt its resource configuration in the face of adversity.

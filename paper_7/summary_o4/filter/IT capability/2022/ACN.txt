Accenture’s management observes that the company’s results of operations are affected by macroeconomic conditions, including inflationary environments and economic and geopolitical uncertainty, which have impacted and may continue to impact the business through wage inflation and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, and it leverages its strength in technology, industry experience, functional expertise and global delivery capability to optimize operations, accelerate revenue growth and enhance services in response to evolving market conditions. As a global enterprise with revenues denominated in multiple currencies, Accenture manages foreign currency exposure through contractual currency protection provisions and hedging programs to mitigate the effect of unfavorable fluctuations on revenues, costs and operating income. The company proactively plans and manages the size and composition of its workforce, adjusts new hiring levels, compensation and, when necessary, involuntary terminations to align its supply of skills and resources with client demand, mitigate attrition driven by a competitive labor market and maintain operational flexibility. In fiscal 2022, Accenture improved contract pricing and altered the mix of people and utilization of technology to partially offset higher labor and subcontractor costs, acknowledging that these actions may not fully offset the impact of compensation increases on margin and emphasizing the importance of matching people, skills and global deployment with client requirements. Cost of services encompasses contract delivery, recruiting and training, software development and integration of acquisitions, reflecting the company’s systemic approach to resource allocation and knowledge integration. In its managed services business, the firm responds to client demands for application modernization, cloud enablement, managed security services, data and analytics, automation and artificial intelligence to transform operations, drive productivity and cost savings. Accenture maintains that its working capital, cash reserves and debt facilities are sufficient to satisfy its short- and long-term funding requirements, with cash holdings strategically located in jurisdictions without regulatory restrictions to ensure liquidity and operational continuity. The company also retains the flexibility to adjust capital allocation, including share repurchases, dividends and acquisitions, in response to evolving economic conditions, business confidence levels and strategic priorities. In fiscal 2022, management executed the disposal of its business in Russia, recording a non-operating loss and demonstrating the firm’s capacity to reconfigure its operations in response to geopolitical disruptions. Accenture continuously evaluates its tax positions, establishing liabilities or reducing assets in line with judgments about potential outcomes under audit, recognizing that final determinations could materially affect future tax provisions, net income or cash flows. The firm acknowledges obligations under contractual commitments for cloud hosting, software subscriptions, information technology services and other non-cancelable arrangements, reinforcing its awareness of ongoing external pressures and resource commitments that inform its resilience strategies.

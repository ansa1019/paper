In our Business Environment discussion, we observe that the global economy continued to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic even as many countries showed signs of slowing activity and entered an environment of significant inflationary pressures, rising interest rates and supply-chain bottlenecks, all of which posed internal and external variations and disturbances to our asset management and insurance businesses; despite these headwinds—including monetary and fiscal tightening, currency volatility, geopolitical uncertainty from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, protectionist policies, disruptions to energy markets, labor cost pressure and regulatory constraints—several key economic indicators, notably U.S. employment, have demonstrated resilience in 2022, reflecting the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. We have responded with operational flexibility by rotating into higher-yielding assets, managing liquidity and hedging market risks through equity futures and options to offset variable annuity embedded derivatives, and maintaining a cash-flow matching strategy for insurance liabilities that includes holding investments at maturity to recover carried-forward losses. At the same time, our capital deployment across private equity, real assets and credit strategies—while mindful of elevated policyholder surrenders in a higher-rate environment, higher funding costs on new business, and tightening credit markets—continues to support new capital raising, fee generation and the preservation of firm performance, demonstrating our capacity to adapt, allocate resources and preserve functioning despite fiscal, monetary, geopolitical and market adversities.

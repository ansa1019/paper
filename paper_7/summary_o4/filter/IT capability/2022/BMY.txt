In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company adopted several procedures focused on ensuring the continued supply of its medicines to patients and protecting the health, wellbeing and safety of its workforce, recognizing the dynamic nature of the situation and the difficulty of reasonably assessing its full impact on business continuity. The Company continues to evaluate and prepare for the potential material impacts of legislative changes such as the Inflation Reduction Act and evolving international tax rules, reflecting ongoing risk assessment and resource allocation under external pressures. To bolster operational flexibility and capacity, the Company expanded its cell therapy manufacturing capabilities at existing facilities in Washington and New Jersey and is constructing new state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Massachusetts and Leiden, Netherlands. The principal strategy combines the resources, scale and capability of a large pharmaceutical company with the speed, agility and innovation of the biotech sector, underpinned by disciplined management of marketing, selling and administrative expenses to deliver the strategic, financial and operational flexibility needed to invest in priority opportunities. Integration initiatives following the Celgene acquisition yielded at least $3.0 billion of annual synergies across general and administrative, manufacturing, R&D and procurement functions, while integration expenses and impairment charges were actively managed through periodic reviews and fair-value adjustments. The Company’s ESG strategy, which is integrated into its core strategy, emphasizes effective governance, stakeholder dialogue, inclusion, access and affordability, health equity and environmental stewardship as critical components of long-term business value and nonfinancial risk management. Liquidity and capital resources are regularly assessed—taking into account working capital needs, debt maturities, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and potential acquisitions—to maintain a strong investment-grade credit rating and ensure sufficient cash generation and access to capital markets for at least the next few years. A robust governance framework, including a company-wide policy and regular monitoring procedures to limit sales to direct customers based on expected demand in compliance with the SEC consent order, supports regulatory compliance and organizational resilience. Critical accounting policies and estimates—such as revenue recognition adjustments for charge-backs, rebates and inventory returns, fair-value measurements for acquisitions and intangible assets, impairment testing of long-lived assets, deferred tax valuation allowances, and accruals for contingencies—are subject to ongoing evaluation to maintain system integrity and performance under varied internal and external disturbances.

In our management’s discussion and analysis, we emphasize our continuous innovation across our cloud-based HCM technology platforms and service solutions to help clients navigate a highly dynamic world of work and maintain business continuity under challenging environments such as global recession, market volatility, international conflict and pandemics. We invest in system development and programming to support and maintain new and existing products, and in our sales organization, marketing and digital-enablement initiatives to anticipate evolving client needs, thereby enhancing our operational flexibility, adaptability and strategic agility. Our strong business model generates significant cash flows with low capital intensity, providing sufficient free cash flow to satisfy dividends, share repurchases and debt obligations, which enables us to absorb the impact of downturns and remain steadfast in our reinvestments and long-term strategy. We maintain solid liquidity through corporate cash balances, available borrowings under a $9.7 billion committed credit facility, a high-quality commercial paper program and secured reverse repurchase agreements, while our investment strategy for client funds focuses on safety of principal, liquidity, diversification and laddered maturities to preserve system integrity and performance under environmental disturbances. Our risk management framework addresses cyber security, system interruptions, natural disasters, supply-chain disruptions and regulatory changes, and our compliance expertise supports clients’ resilience in adapting to evolving legislative and economic conditions. Our broad-based, company-wide transformation initiatives and related consulting, severance and asset dispositions further reconfigure our operating model, driving continuous improvement in efficiency and effectiveness. The roll-out of a unified user experience and next-gen payroll solution across hundreds of thousands of clients, along with enhancements such as self-enrollment with digital wallet capabilities, earned wage access and soon-to-launch employee listening tools, demonstrates our capability to reconfigure service trajectories, deliver sustainable, profitable growth and help our clients preserve functioning and thrive in the face of adversity. Our solid financial condition as of June 30, 2022, consistent retention rates, record new business bookings and credit ratings underpin our ability to continue supporting associates and clients, reinforcing our organizational resilience and capacity to emerge stronger from disruptive events.

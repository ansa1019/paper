Abbott mobilized its teams across multiple fronts to develop and launch COVID-19 diagnostic tests, including rapid point-of-care, over-the-counter, laboratory-based serology and multiplex molecular assays, and rapidly reconfigured its manufacturing network to align capacity with shifting testing demand and governmental guidance. Throughout the pandemic, the company ensured that its operations worldwide were aligned with evolving governmental orders and guidelines, took aggressive steps to limit COVID-19 exposure and enhance facility safety for employees, and managed supply chain challenges—governmental lockdowns, inflationary pressures and material shortages—without significant disruption by diversifying sourcing, converting manufacturing lines, prioritizing production at alternate facilities and importing product under regulatory permissions. In response to the voluntary recall and production stoppage at its Sturgis infant formula facility, Abbott mitigated impacts by shipments from Ireland, prioritization of production in Columbus, liquid-ready-to-feed conversions, increased output at Casa Grande and permitted imports from Spain. The company approved restructuring plans to streamline operations, reduce costs and improve efficiencies across diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional and pharmaceutical businesses, recording severance, inventory and asset impairment charges, and later reversing charges as demand fluctuations occurred. Abbott’s resilience strategy includes disciplined working capital management, maintaining approximately $10.2 billion of cash and short-term investments, $5 billion of undrawn credit commitments and an AA-/A1 investment grade rating, supporting sustained dividend increases, share repurchase flexibility and continued R&D investment of approximately 7 percent of sales. Management regularly assesses and provisionally accrues for litigation, tax and credit risks, conducts goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing, and navigates regulatory complexity—including EU MDR and IVDR transitions—thereby preserving system integrity, operational flexibility, risk mitigation capacity and the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

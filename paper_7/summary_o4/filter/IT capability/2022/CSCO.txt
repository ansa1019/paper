Cisco reports that in fiscal 2022 it delivered growth in total revenue and strong profitability under challenging conditions—including significant supply constraints, rising component and related costs, and the Russia-Ukraine war—and has taken multiple strategic and operational actions to mitigate these pressures by partnering with key suppliers, revising supplier arrangements, paying higher component and logistics costs, modifying product designs, optimizing inventory build and customer delivery plans, and increasing inventory balances, purchase commitments and prepayments, while recognizing the elevated risk of excess and obsolete inventory. The company has continued the transition of its business model toward higher-margin software and subscription offerings, aggressively invested in priority areas to drive long-term profitable growth, and accelerated innovation across its portfolio despite macroeconomic and competitive uncertainties. In response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Cisco ceased operations in Russia and Belarus, assessed asset recoverability risks, reserved for the non-recoverability of substantially all related assets and recorded non-recurring charges for uncollectible receivables, special personnel support and exit costs. It routinely evaluates its exposure to inventory write-downs and liability for purchase commitments and balances supply chain flexibility against obsolescence risk amid rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. To realign resources and enable further investment in key priorities, the company completed a restructuring plan— including a voluntary early retirement program—and continues to monitor critical accounting estimates affected by the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on supply constraints. Cisco maintains substantial cash, cash equivalents, investments and committed credit lines, which it deploys for strategic investments, acquisitions, working capital, dividends and share repurchases, and believes these resources will satisfy its liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months despite ongoing disruptions.

Management discusses the significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption created by the COVID-19 pandemic and the various responses to it, noting a recent return to more normal societal interactions including operational norms, while acknowledging the unpredictability of ongoing and future pandemics (see Part I, Item IA: Risk Factors). We have built our own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) to efficiently stream a high volume of content over the Internet, reflecting investments in operational flexibility, resource allocation and continuity of service. We expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change and we may test other plan and price variations, demonstrating adaptive strategies to external pressures and market volatility. To isolate underlying trends, we present constant currency information to exclude effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on average monthly revenue per paying membership, supporting risk mitigation against currency volatility. Technology and development expenses increased primarily due to higher personnel-related costs for making improvements to our service offerings—including testing, maintaining and modifying our user interface, our recommendations, merchandising and infrastructure—underscoring our focus on innovation and system resilience. Our primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, marketing programs, streaming delivery and personnel-related costs, as well as strategic acquisitions and investments, and we anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and financing sources, including our revolving credit facility, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months and beyond, reflecting proactive planning and resource management. Content obligations—including non-cancelable commitments for acquisition, licensing and production—totaled $7.6 billion on the balance sheet and $14.2 billion off-balance sheet, with expected payments of approximately $1 billion to $4 billion over the next three years based on management judgment, illustrating our capacity to forecast and adapt to uncertain future obligations. We anticipate that future capital requirements from the debt market will be more limited versus prior years, and our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and capital market conditions, reflecting strategic foresight and risk assessment. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $1,634 million driven by revenue growth and decreased cash payments for content assets, while changes in investing and financing activities reflected shifts in strategic investments and capital structure actions, demonstrating financial flexibility and resilience in resource deployment. In assessing liquidity relative to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income and note major recurring differences—including excess content payments over amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation, non-cash remeasurement gains or losses on euro-denominated debt and other working capital movements—providing a systemic perspective on performance under pressure. Finally, our critical accounting estimates require management to apply judgment and assumptions—grounded in historical experience and reasonable circumstances—when capitalizing and amortizing content assets over contractual availability windows or estimated periods of use on an accelerated basis, and when valuing deferred tax assets, including allowances for uncertain tax positions, reflecting organizational intelligence, dynamic capabilities and structured risk management processes designed to preserve or improve functioning under varying internal and external conditions.

The company’s disclosures emphasize its commitment to maintaining continuity and performance under internal and external pressures by digitally enabling its integrated ecosystem “for nearly three decades” to decrease variability, provide dependable, consistent functionality, and optimize efficiency; it reports investing heavily in its workforce and in priority development programs while eliminating avoidable spend, securing its team “economically,” and collecting internal and external insights to inform adaptive work models and return-to-office strategies that align with evolving health, safety, and operational needs. In response to macroeconomic and supply-chain disruptions, the company acknowledges “increased difficulties in obtaining a sufficient supply” of critical components and states that it “is engaged in activities to seek to mitigate supply disruptions,” vertically integrating key technologies to foster a more robust supply chain and ensure continuity of supply by working closely with suppliers and distributors. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it implemented a customer relief program offering service-fee credits, deferred lease payments, and extended payment terms to absorb strain and preserve customer operations while planning for long-term recovery. The firm underscores its proactive resource allocation and risk mitigation strategies by maintaining a substantial cash and investment position “sufficient to meet liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future,” investing in high‐quality fixed-income securities to manage financial risk, and retaining the flexibility to repatriate foreign earnings as needed. Its adoption of flexible financing structures—sales-type and operating leases and usage-based arrangements—demonstrates strategic agility in addressing customer capital constraints, while its regular monitoring of installed base, placement, and utilization metrics supports ongoing forecasting, performance assessment under pressure, and informed decision-making to sustain growth, resilience, and transformation in turbulent markets.

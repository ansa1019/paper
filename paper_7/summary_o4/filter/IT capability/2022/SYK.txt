Management’s discussion highlights a range of operational and strategic initiatives and risk-mitigation measures that collectively support the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including increased inflationary pressures and global supply chain disruptions—such as labor shortages, steel and transportation cost increases and electronic component shortages—that have adversely impacted operations and constrained sales growth, although supply chain constraints eased in the fourth quarter; in response to geopolitical turbulence from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and associated sanctions, we have continued to operate in affected regions where safe, while monitoring volatility in global markets, supply chains and energy prices; in China, we have adapted to volume-based procurement and import purchase evaluation programs by bidding successfully in certain categories, exiting non-strategic businesses where bids were unsuccessful, and modifying our commercial operations to preserve performance; we believe our financial condition remains of high quality as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow, which serves as our primary source of funding for operating needs, capital expenditures and acquisitions, and by our continued access to capital markets at competitive rates, supported by strong investment-grade debt ratings, a global cash management strategy that balances liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations, and the use of commercial paper, credit lines and debt as necessary to sustain short-term liquidity and operating requirements; our long-term capital allocation strategy prioritizes acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases, and we maintain debt levels deemed appropriate after evaluating cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans and overall cost of capital; we continue to invest in innovation and integration of recent acquisitions, recording goodwill and intangible-asset impairments when carrying values exceed estimated fair values, and performing annual qualitative and quantitative impairment tests—using discounted cash flow analyses with assumptions for revenue growth, operating margin and weighted average cost of capital—to ensure system integrity and mitigate the risk of brittle financial or operational structures; we maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, product liabilities and uncertain tax positions based on historical experience, expected future trends, consultation with legal counsel and progress of audits, and we adjust these reserves and establish liabilities as facts and circumstances evolve to limit potential material adverse effects on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

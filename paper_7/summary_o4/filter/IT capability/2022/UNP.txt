Union Pacific’s disclosures describe a multifaceted approach to organizational resilience, beginning with a comprehensive safety management system that employs “total safety culture, courage to care, commit, and peer to peer” programs validated by a third-party expert and continuously refined through hazard identification, risk assessments, root cause analysis, and CDC-aligned health policies to maintain employee well-being and operational continuity amid COVID-19 and other illnesses. Predictive technologies in the operating practices command center and enhancements to proprietary software enable proactive intervention to prevent derailments, while increased replacement of freight car wheels and measures to address human-factor yard derailments preserve network integrity. In response to severe network congestion, the company reconfigured resource deployment by hiring and relocating 1,302 new train, engine, and yard employees, adding locomotives, and reducing freight car inventory, thereby restoring fluidity and service reliability. A 2023 capital plan of approximately $3.6 billion targets infrastructure hardening, asset replacement, locomotive fleet modernization, intermodal ramp improvements, and capacity expansions to sustain performance under varying internal and external pressures. Financial resilience is upheld through continuous scenario analysis, generation of $9.4 billion of operating cash, free cash flow of $2.7 billion, compliance with debt covenants, and access to $2.7 billion of undrawn credit facilities, enabling business continuity during macroeconomic uncertainty and fuel price volatility managed via surcharge programs and a record 1% improvement in fuel consumption rate. Sustainability efforts outlined in a climate action plan—focusing on improved operational efficiency, renewable and alternative fuels, and stakeholder engagement—further strengthen the network’s ability to adapt to environmental disruptions. Labor-relation resilience is secured through RLA-guided negotiations, mediation, presidential emergency board recommendations, and legislative resolutions to ensure workforce stability. Together, these strategies and adaptive practices enable the company to absorb strain, maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, and transform to emerge stronger from disruptive events.

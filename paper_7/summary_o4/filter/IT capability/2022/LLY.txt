As part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and at the request of the U.S. and international governments, we invested in large-scale manufacturing of COVID-19 antibodies at risk to ensure rapid patient access, incurring a net inventory impairment charge as demand and near-term expiry dates shifted; we have faced and expect to continue to face challenges meeting strong demand for our incretin products, including intermittent delays in fulfilling certain U.S. orders and supply disruptions internationally, and have implemented measures to minimize patient impact while anticipating persistent tight supplies until additional internal and contracted manufacturing capacity becomes fully operational around the world in the coming years, with significant expansion planned in 2023. We believe our available cash and cash equivalents, together with our ability to generate operating cash flow and our access to short- and long-term borrowings—including $7.33 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $7.00 billion of which supports our commercial paper program—are sufficient to fund existing and planned capital requirements such as working capital, capital expenditures, defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit contributions, and potential business development activities; accordingly, our management continuously evaluates liquidity and capital resources to ensure adequate and efficient financing. In 2022, we committed over $2 billion to two new facilities in Indiana, more than $1 billion to a facility in North Carolina, and €400 million to a facility in Ireland to expand our manufacturing network, and in early 2023 we committed an additional $450 million to increase parenteral filling, device assembly, and packaging capacity in North Carolina. We acquire and collaborate on external research and technologies—including the December 2022 acquisition of Akouos, Inc., funded through cash on hand and contingent value rights—to enhance our pipeline and strengthen our business, viewing milestone and royalty payment arrangements as indicators of successful product development and future cash-flow potential. To address environmental disruptions, we have entered various contract manufacturing and supply-agreement arrangements that may require specified purchase commitments over multi-year durations, and we employ a controlled risk-management program using derivative financial instruments to mitigate fluctuations in interest rates, currency exchange rates—principally the U.S. dollar against the euro, Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan—and equity fair values, striving to maintain an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and hedged currency exposures. We believe our critical accounting estimates for sales returns, rebates, and discount accruals; litigation liabilities and other contingencies; fair-value measurements of contingent consideration; and impairment testing of long-lived and indefinite-lived assets are reasonable and supported by current facts and circumstances, and we conduct regular reviews—qualitative and quantitative—to ensure recoverability of assets. In response to changing tax regulations, including the capitalization and amortization of R&D expenses under the 2017 Tax Act, we continuously assess uncertain tax positions, record appropriate valuation allowances, and monitor the impacts of evolving tax and healthcare legislation, economic conditions, customer creditworthiness, and global transportation and labor-market strains—all with the objective of absorbing strain and preserving or improving functionality and performance in the face of adversity.

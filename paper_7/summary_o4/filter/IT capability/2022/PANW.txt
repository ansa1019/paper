The company emphasizes maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions by empowering enterprises, organizations, service providers, and government entities to protect themselves against sophisticated cyber threats through comprehensive cybersecurity platforms backed by industry-leading artificial intelligence and automation, thereby preserving operational integrity and mitigating risks. Its security solutions are designed to reduce total cost of ownership by improving operational efficiency and eliminating siloed point products, reflecting a systemic perspective and resource reconfiguration to enhance adaptability and competitive advantage. Management acknowledges that sustaining growth and firm performance requires continuous investment in innovation, the timely development of new features and products, and the improvement and expansion of information technology and financial infrastructure, operating and administrative systems and controls, and effective management of headcount, capital, and processes. In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the company has been actively monitoring, evaluating, and responding to developments that cause global, social, and business disruption, instituting a global work-from-home policy without significant operational interruption, and committing to further operational adjustments as required to safeguard employee well-being and ensure business continuity. The company also confronts significant supply chain challenges, including chip and component shortages that have increased costs and lead times, and it continues to work to minimize these effects, demonstrating resilience through risk mitigation and adaptability to external pressures. Liquidity and capital resource management involve monitoring cash flow provided by operating activities to better understand and manage cash needs, defining free cash flow to assess resource generation after necessary capital expenditures, and maintaining sufficient cash, cash equivalents, and investment balances to meet anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. The company further acknowledges that its future capital requirements and ability to raise additional financing depend on factors such as growth rates, spending on development and infrastructure, expansion of sales and marketing activities, macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, and potential actions by governmental authorities, reflecting proactive risk assessment, strategic foresight, and preparation for resource constraints under adverse conditions.

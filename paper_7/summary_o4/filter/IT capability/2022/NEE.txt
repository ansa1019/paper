Nee’s management articulates resilience through diversified operational and financial strategies designed to absorb strain and maintain performance under internal and external pressures. The company allocates resources across its principal businesses, FPL and NEER, to support and grow operations using cash flows from operations, short- and long-term borrowings, equity issuances, and asset sales, thereby preserving liquidity and capital resources even during adverse events. It monitors solar supply chain disruptions from Southeast Asian locations and “takes steps intended to mitigate potential risks” to solar project development and construction activities, while FPL’s service area response to hurricane Ian and hurricane Nicole—incurring approximately $1.3 billion of recoverable storm restoration costs and filing a petition for cost recovery plus storm reserve replenishment—illustrates proactive crisis management and operational continuity. Risk mitigation through derivative instruments, including energy, interest rate and foreign currency hedges, and the use of adjusted earnings to exclude the volatility of non-qualifying hedges reflect sophisticated risk assessment and performance maintenance mechanisms. Reserve amortization adjustments under Florida Public Service Commission rate agreements are employed to achieve targeted regulatory returns on equity, demonstrating strategic resource reconfiguration in response to regulatory constraints. The segmentation change consolidating FPL ratemaking entities and the allocation of interest expense based on deemed capital structures exemplify adaptive organizational change processes. The maintenance of substantial credit facilities, the preservation of strong investment-grade ratings, and the execution of guarantee arrangements and letters of credit to support trading obligations and project financing provide systemic flexibility and reinforce the organization’s capacity to respond effectively to environmental disruptions, maintain system integrity, and emerge with competitive advantage.

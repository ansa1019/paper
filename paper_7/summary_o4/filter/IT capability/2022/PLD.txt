In 2022, our operating results remained robust, with our O&M portfolio occupancy at 98.2% and net effective rent change of 48.0%, despite headwinds from capital market volatility, ongoing inflation, steeply rising interest rates and the war and energy crisis in Europe, demonstrating the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under challenging conditions. We maintained business continuity and system integrity through disciplined capital deployment—pausing contributions into open‐ended funds, focusing on build‐to‐suit developments and continuing to allocate capital to renovate and modernize our operating portfolio with sustainable and efficient building features—while preserving $4.1 billion of available liquidity via expanded global credit facilities and natural hedges achieved by borrowing in the currencies where we invest and using derivatives to manage foreign currency exchange and interest rate risk. Strategic risk mitigation and resource reconfiguration included terminating our 2019 global facility, entering the 2022 global facility and upsizing our second facility to increase total borrowing capacity to $5.0 billion, assuming $4.2 billion of debt in the Duke transaction and prudently managing debt maturities and covenants to support future planning under uncertain market conditions. We evaluate our business on an ownership-blind basis, reviewing NOI by segment, same store property NOI and our share of earnings from unconsolidated co-investment ventures to derive consistent measures of operating performance, and we monitor asset recoverability and fair value lease adjustments to guard against impairment, thereby reinforcing our adaptability, operational flexibility and resilience strategies to sustain performance and emerge stronger from disruptions.

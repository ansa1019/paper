During the periods under review, management highlighted the maintenance of operational continuity and positive adjustment under challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, noting uncertainty around inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, monetary policy, tax changes and foreign currency fluctuations and their potential to exacerbate supply chain constraints and worsen economic challenges, including recessionary periods and international conflicts such as the Russia/Ukraine war and China/Taiwan tensions. The company experienced increases in cost and limited availability of raw materials, components and other inputs necessary to manufacture and distribute products due to global supply chain disruptions, which were partly mitigated by foreign currency hedging gains, and anticipates similar pressures in 2023. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company acknowledged negative impacts on demand, gross margins and operating expenses and stated its intention to manage through these challenges with strategic focus and the winning spirit of its global team. To bolster resilience and support strategic imperatives, management reorganized its operational structure in early 2022 by aggregating core businesses into two reportable segments and revised prior periods to conform to the current presentation. Supply chain network optimization, functional capability building and manufacturing-line transfers under a global restructuring program approved in 2018 and extended in 2021 were substantially completed by 2022, and a new restructuring plan approved in 2023 aims to optimize functional capabilities, achieve cost synergies, reduce pre-tax expenses by $225–275 million by the end of 2025 and reinvest savings into strategic growth initiatives. Resource allocation and risk mitigation measures include ongoing investments in research and development to maintain a pipeline of innovative technologies that address unmet clinical needs, targeted investments across businesses, disciplined cash management and diversification of short-term financial instruments, maintenance of sufficient liquidity through cash, operating cash flows, access to capital markets and credit facilities, and the use of non-GAAP performance measures—such as adjusted net income and organic net sales growth—to evaluate trends, guide decision-making and allocate resources. Implementation of the European Union Medical Device Regulation, adoption of ISO 50001:2018 energy management and ISO 14001:2015 environmental management systems, achievement of LEED certification at key sites and a commitment to carbon neutrality for scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 underscore the company’s systemic perspective on operational resilience and sustainability. Controls and procedures have been established to escalate enterprise-level cybersecurity issues, analyze risks through a crisis committee, report material impacts to the board and ensure timely disclosure, and the company has undertaken readiness assessments of critical business functions to reduce the potential impact of cybersecurity events arising from international conflicts. Critical accounting judgments in revenue recognition, inventory provisions, valuation of intangible assets and contingent consideration, goodwill impairment testing, legal and product liability accruals and tax reserves further reflect the company’s adaptation of governance and financial reporting processes to preserve integrity and performance under varying internal and external pressures.

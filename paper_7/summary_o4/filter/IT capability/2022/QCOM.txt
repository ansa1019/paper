In fiscal 2022, Qualcomm’s organizational resilience manifested through strategic resource allocation, risk mitigation and operational adaptability to maintain performance under varying conditions. Our revenues have historically fluctuated based on consumer demand for devices, timing of customer launches and innovation cycles, and these trends may or may not continue, prompting ongoing adjustments in working capital and in inventories, which are measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value based on estimates of future demand and macroeconomic conditions. Advanced payments of $2.3 billion to suppliers under multi-year capacity commitments and elevated working capital requirements—including higher inventory and accounts receivable—reflect adaptive management of supply-chain constraints, while capacity constraints have largely abated even as price increases from key semiconductor wafer suppliers are anticipated. We issued $1.5 billion of unsecured fixed-rate notes to refinance maturing debt, maintain liquidity and support strategic investments such as the acquisition of Veoneer, and manage an outstanding $15.4 billion of notes with maturities through 2052. Our principal sources of liquidity remain cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, operating cash flow and debt programs, and we continue to devote resources to fostering inter-organizational collaboration by educating industry participants and governments on our licensing programs and technology investments. The reversal of a €997 million European Commission fine and resulting $1.1 billion benefit in other income exemplified our capacity to absorb legal and regulatory pressures, supported by contingent loss provisions recorded when probable and estimable. We monitor our investees and equity investments for impairment events—including assessing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on business continuity, liquidity and going-concern risks—and have recorded no significant losses to date, while making significant judgments in tax provision estimates, capitalization and amortization of research and development expenditures, and potential impacts of U.S.–China trade tensions, inflation-reduction measures and pandemic uncertainties. Our critical accounting estimates—covering revenue recognition, inventory valuation, goodwill impairment, legal contingencies and income taxes—are reviewed continuously to preserve system integrity and firm performance under internal and external disturbances, ensuring operational flexibility, strategic foresight and ongoing positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

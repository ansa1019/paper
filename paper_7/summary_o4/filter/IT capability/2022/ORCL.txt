In management’s discussion and analysis, we emphasize organizational flexibility and continuity by providing choice in deployment models—on-premise, cloud-based, and hybrid—to enable customers to pivot existing license environments to Oracle Cloud and to migrate and expand workloads; to address dynamic customer demand, we strategically invest in research and development and in expanding data center capacity and geographic footprint, and we execute an active acquisition program, with rigorous pre-closing evaluation of financial impact, to absorb strain and transform our capabilities. We manage operational adaptability through revenue recognition judgments under ASC 606—determining distinct performance obligations and standalone selling prices amid competitive and economic fluctuations—and through annual impairment reviews of goodwill and finite-lived intangible assets, applying qualitative and quantitative factors such as industry trends, macroeconomic conditions, and internal forecasts, while continuously monitoring legal, tax and other contingencies, recognizing liabilities for probable losses and reevaluating estimates as facts develop. Our restructuring initiatives, including employee severance and reallocation of resources under our 2022 Restructuring Plan, realign cost structure and redirect investments into second-generation cloud infrastructure to enhance resilience and performance under pressure. We mitigate supply chain and market disruptions by de-emphasizing non-strategic hardware while sustaining hardware support offerings, and we maintain liquidity through disciplined working capital management, access to revolving and bridge credit facilities, opportunistic stock repurchases, dividend policies and free cash flow generation. In response to external shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical events, including withdrawal from operations in Russia and Belarus, we evaluate and adapt our global operations and expense levels, maintaining profitability and positive cash flow to ensure the maintenance of organizational integrity and performance despite adversity.

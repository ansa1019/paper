In our MD&A we disclose that following the April 1, 2020 merger with Sprint we have reconfigured our network operations and business processes to enhance the breadth and depth of our nationwide 5G network, accelerate innovation and eliminate redundancies through integration and decommissioning of duplicative macro and small cell sites, rationalization of backhaul and retail channels and retirement of legacy CDMA and LTE networks, recognizing merger-related integration and restructuring costs—including severance, contract terminations, IT migrations and network decommissioning—that are excluded from adjusted EBITDA as non-recurring and anticipating an additional $1.0 billion of such costs to realize projected synergies; in conjunction with the retirement and planned sale of our wireline business we have assessed and recorded impairment charges and classified the disposal group as held for sale, illustrating our resource reallocation and strategic transformation under external disruptions; we also responded to significant cyberattacks by recording remediation and litigation expenses, committing over $150 million to data security technology and allocating substantial further resources to enhance our cybersecurity program and transform our approach to risk mitigation and emergency management; we continue to monitor macroeconomic and geopolitical pressures—including potential economic recession, inflation, changes in monetary policy and interest rates—and maintain principal funding sources, free cash flow generation and revolving credit capacity to secure operational liquidity, sustain capital expenditures on spectrum licenses, network infrastructure integration and financing leases and support ongoing multi-year investments in spectrum acquisitions and spectrum lease obligations that underpin operational flexibility and business continuity; additionally, our ongoing stock repurchase authorization of up to $14.0 billion demonstrates strategic capital deployment to support long-term shareholder value.

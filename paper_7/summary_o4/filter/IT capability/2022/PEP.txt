Throughout 2022, PepsiCo encountered significant external pressures—including supply chain disruptions, inflationary cost environments, shifting consumer preferences, the COVID-19 pandemic, a worsening climate crisis, geopolitical conflicts such as the Ukraine-Russia war, a highly competitive operating environment, rapid retail disruption and evolving legal and regulatory requirements—and responded by launching Pep+, a strategic end-to-end transformation embedding sustainability and human capital to sustain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, driving regenerative agriculture partnerships with ADM, MIT, Corteva and N-Drip, targeting net-zero emissions, net water positivity and reusable packaging, and evolving its portfolio toward healthier and more sustainable products. To absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning, the company leverages an integrated risk management framework overseen by the board and cross-functional committees—including the PepsiCo Risk Committee, audit, compensation, governance and sustainability committees—to systematically identify, assess, prioritize, address and communicate strategic, financial, operational, compliance, safety and reputational risks through productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs, fixed-price contracts, derivative hedging, internal audit, compliance and disclosure functions, and scenario-based monitoring of commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate volatility. PepsiCo continuously monitors and adapts to international and climate-related regulations—advocating alternative measures, adjusting sourcing and production practices—and aligns reporting calendars for key acquisitions such as Pioneer Foods and Hangzhou Haomusi to integrate operations and maintain business continuity. In response to the Ukraine-Russia conflict, the company suspended operations and capital investments in affected regions, recorded impairment charges, and reconfigured resource allocation, distribution networks and workforce safety measures to preserve organizational health and ensure resilience across nominal, extreme and exceptional disturbances.

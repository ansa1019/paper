In response to challenging macroeconomic, regulatory, and geopolitical conditions, the company undertook cost management initiatives—including facilities consolidation, an approximately 11,000-employee layoff, and a pivot in its data center strategy—incurring $4.61 billion in restructuring charges that reconfigured resource deployment and impaired certain leases and data center assets. These measures lowered operating margin and diluted earnings per share, demonstrating adaptability under adversity. To mitigate risks from changes such as GDPR and iOS privacy updates, the company is evolving its advertising systems, developing privacy-enhancing technologies to reduce personal information processing, and investing in artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve ad delivery, targeting, and measurement capabilities. It engages with industry peers on new open standards for secure data processing, deploys AI-powered discovery engines and new formats like reels to confront competitive and macroeconomic pressures, and adjusts to fluctuating advertising demand driven by inflation, interest rates, the war in Ukraine, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Seasonal revenue patterns are managed to sustain operational continuity, and foreign exchange impacts are addressed through constant currency reporting. Ongoing qualitative assessments of uncertain tax positions, loss contingencies, impairment of long-lived assets, and lease obligations reflect systematic risk assessment and resilience engineering, enabling the organization to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite internal and external disturbances.

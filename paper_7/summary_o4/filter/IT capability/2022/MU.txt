The Company’s discussion and analysis describes multiple operational and financial responses to adverse market conditions and other pressures that collectively support its ability to absorb strain and maintain functioning under challenging circumstances. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, a sharp deterioration in the memory and storage industry environment—driven by global macroeconomic headwinds and customer inventory adjustments—led to significant reductions in bit shipments and average selling prices, and the Company anticipates further declines in the first quarter of 2023; to address elevated inventory levels and mitigate cost headwinds, it is selectively reducing facility utilization in both DRAM and NAND. The Company continuously evaluates alternatives for efficiently funding capital expenditures and ongoing operations—drawing on cash generated from operations, a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, high‐credit‐quality investments to limit concentration risk, and the issuance of $1 billion in 2032 green bonds to fund sustainability-focused projects—and expects its liquidity sources and cash flows to meet requirements for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. To support future growth, operating efficiencies and product quality, it plans approximately $8 billion of capital expenditures in 2023, contingent in part on government incentives under the Chips Act, and has announced plans to build two new leading-edge DRAM fabs in the United States with targeted production in the latter half of the decade. The Company’s strategic resource allocation includes a flexible share repurchase authorization subject to market conditions and an ongoing assessment of the mix of dividends, share repurchases and debt financing as best uses of available cash. In its critical accounting estimates, the Company demonstrates risk assessment and organizational flexibility by recording inventory write-downs when net realizable values fall below cost, testing goodwill for impairment based on forecasted cash flows and qualitative factors, reviewing property, plant and equipment for recoverability and impairment when events indicate carrying values may not be recoverable, and monitoring tax incentive arrangements and potential tax reforms that could affect its effective tax rate—all processes that reflect adaptive strategies, forward orientation and system integrity amid internal and external disturbances.

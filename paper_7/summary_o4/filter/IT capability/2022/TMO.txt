Since 2020, the life sciences solutions and specialty diagnostics segments as well as the laboratory products business have supported COVID-19 diagnostic testing, scaling and evolving their molecular diagnostics solutions and plastic consumables businesses to respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, while the biosciences and bioproduction businesses have expanded their capacity to meet the needs of pharma and biotech customers as they have expanded their own production volumes to meet global vaccine manufacturing requirements and our pharma services business has provided our pharma and biotech customers with the services they needed to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally. These initiatives, which reflect targeted strategic growth investments in enhancing commercial capabilities—including expansion of geographic sales reach, e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, research and development projects and incentive compensation for employees—and productivity improvements through the practical process improvement business system, global sourcing initiatives, headcount reductions, facility consolidations and low-cost region manufacturing, were partially offset by lower COVID-19 testing volumes and higher amortization expense from recent acquisitions but were supported by strong pricing realization across all segments to address inflationary pressures. The company’s proven growth strategy has enabled it to generate free cash flow as well as access the capital markets, deploying capital primarily via mergers and acquisitions—such as the acquisitions of viral vector manufacturing, molecular diagnostics and clinical research businesses—and secondarily via share buybacks and dividends, while managing liquidity through non-U.S. cash balances, available borrowing capacity under a $5 billion revolving credit facility and disciplined working capital investments in accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable. Management’s ongoing use of non-GAAP measures to forecast and evaluate operational performance, its annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets using discounted cash flow and peer trading multiples, and its assessment of unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowances further demonstrate a systemic perspective on risk assessment, resource reconfiguration and adaptation of organizational practices to preserve integrity and maintain performance under varying internal and external pressures.

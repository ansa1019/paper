Our management discussion details how we have proactively structured our supply chain and inventory management—where purchase obligations and prepaid supply agreements represented over half of total supply at the end of fiscal 2023 and inventory provisions of $2.17 billion were recorded—to absorb mismatches between demand and supply and preserve operational continuity. We emphasize our ability to manage complex product transitions across new and legacy architectures—leveraging prior experience shipping multiple architectures simultaneously—to maintain channel inventory balance and revenue stability under volatile market conditions. We acknowledge the inherent uncertainty in nascent use cases, such as our Omniverse platform and third-party large language models, and describe how demand estimates for these emerging applications may be incorrect, illustrating our forward-oriented posture in accepting revenue volatility to benefit from future opportunities. The introduction of U.S. export license requirements prompted relocation of certain R&D and supply operations out of China and the offering of alternative products like A800, exemplifying rapid structural adaptability to regulatory disruptions. Pandemic-related lockdowns and logistic constraints in China are noted as ongoing sources of supply chain volatility, underscoring our operational flexibility under external pressures. In response to geopolitical events, we ceased direct sales and closed operations in Russia, demonstrating our capacity to absorb financial and operational strain. The $1.35 billion write-off upon termination of the Arm acquisition further illustrates our resilience in absorbing setbacks while preserving strategic focus. We highlight our liquidity and capital resource management—maintaining $13.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, evaluating access to external capital, and planning for $1.25 billion of debt maturities and $1.10–$1.30 billion of capital investments—to ensure we can meet future obligations. Our execution of multi-year cloud service agreements and strategic partnerships secures future revenue streams and supports research and development, reinforcing our competitive advantage. Finally, we detail our continuous reassessment of critical accounting estimates—particularly for inventory valuations and revenue recognition—based on historical experience and judgment, thereby sustaining financial integrity and system performance under challenging and evolving conditions.

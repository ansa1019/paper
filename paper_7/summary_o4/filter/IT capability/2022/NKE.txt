During fiscal 2022, Nike substantially reconfigured its organizational structure and operating model in service of its “consumer direct acceleration” strategy, completing a series of leadership and operating model changes designed to streamline decision-making, speed strategic execution and strengthen operational flexibility; these actions included a global workforce reduction with related pre-tax charges, the redeployment of anticipated wage savings into digital transformation and technology investments, and the realignment of product creation and category organizations around a new consumer construct.  To address extreme disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, including government-mandated factory shutdowns in Vietnam and Indonesia, extended transit times that elevated in-transit inventory by 23 percent and higher freight, logistics and fulfillment costs, the company leveraged its operational playbook—rebalancing inventory across geographies, implementing pricing actions and adopting a seasonless product cadence—to preserve product availability and consumer engagement.  Throughout the year, Nike invested in data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering and inventory management to build an end-to-end technology foundation aimed at sustaining performance under volatile market conditions and accelerating the shift to digital and owned-store channels.  The shift from traditional wholesale to a mixed direct and distributor operating model in select regions, alongside centralized foreign exchange risk management with natural offsets and hedging, further underscored Nike’s efforts to mitigate external pressures, enhance supply-chain continuity and reconfigure its resource allocation toward long-term growth, resilience and profitability.

Starbucks’ fiscal 2022 results illustrate the resiliency and strength of our brand, reflecting the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions such as COVID-19-induced interruptions in key markets, particularly China, while delivering 11 percent consolidated revenue growth and comparable store sales increases. In response to inflationary pressures on commodities and supply chain constraints, we launched a U.S. reinvention plan to increase efficiency and bolster business continuity by elevating partner and customer experiences through enhanced wages, comprehensive training to improve retention and productivity, and accelerating purpose-built store concepts and technology innovations. These strategic initiatives, together with pricing decisions and sales-leverage benefits, are expected to mitigate ongoing cost pressures and reinforce adaptability, enabling sustainable, profitable growth over the long term. To preserve organizational performance and system integrity, Starbucks actively manages its liquidity and operational flexibility by internally funding needs and servicing debt from cash flows and investments, utilizing a $3 billion five-year revolving credit facility and a $3 billion commercial paper program, and returning capital to shareholders. Under our market price risk management policy, we employ pricing features in supply contracts and derivative instruments—including commodity hedges, interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and treasury locks—to mitigate volatility in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates and thereby safeguard our operational continuity. We believe that net future cash flows, combined with our capacity to leverage our balance sheet, will sufficiently finance capital requirements, strategic investments and shareholder distributions for at least the next 12 months, while ongoing reviews of cash positions and foreign-earnings reinvestment ensure preparedness for external disturbances and support the company’s adaptive capabilities.

The company’s MD&A emphasizes its role in helping clients “navigate an increasingly dynamic and complex environment” through data-driven risk advisory services, advanced reinsurance and capital strategies, technology-driven solutions and strategic advisory services, reflecting a systemic perspective on business continuity and competitive advantage under external disturbances. In 2022, the firm undertook $427 million of restructuring activities—primarily severance and lease exit charges tied to workforce actions, technology rationalization and real estate reductions—under its operational excellence program, with estimated savings of $125 million to $150 million in 2023, illustrating resource reconfiguration and adaptation to preserve functioning amid organizational change processes. The company’s response to the war in Ukraine, including the deconsolidation of its Russian businesses, recognition of related losses and a definitive exit agreement, demonstrates risk mitigation, crisis response and reconstituting trajectories toward long-term performance maintenance. Noting that “our businesses have remained resilient throughout the pandemic,” the firm highlights strong demand for its advice and services despite unpredictable COVID-19 developments, underscoring positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Liquidity management through a $2.8 billion five-year revolving credit facility, incremental credit lines, regular repatriation of non-U.S. earnings and net investment hedges of €1.1 billion in senior notes addresses environmental turbulence, currency variability and financial resource deployment. Strategic acquisitions of HMS Insurance Inc. and Avascent Group Ltd and the disposition of Mercer’s U.S. affinity business for a net gain of $112 million illustrate future orientation, strategic adaptability and service innovation to reconfigure the company’s portfolio and capitalize on emerging opportunities. Underlying revenue growth of 9% in risk and insurance services—driven by talent investments, solid retention, pricing benefits and a jump in fiduciary interest income from higher rates—and 8% in consulting—supported by strong demand for solutions in workforce transformation, health, retirement and project-based services—reflects operational flexibility, innovation and resilience strategies in response to market volatility. The company’s structured pension funding and deficit contribution agreements in the U.S. and U.K., continuous monitoring of funded status, quarterly reassessment of discount rates and asset performance, and support commitments up to £450 million over seven years underscore organizational capabilities in managing complex benefit obligations, preserving system integrity and maintaining stability under financial pressures. Continuous evaluation of critical accounting policies for revenue recognition, contingent consideration, legal contingencies, retirement benefits and uncertain tax positions demonstrates proactive measures, collateral learning and governance mechanisms to uphold financial reporting accuracy and organizational health amid ongoing uncertainties.

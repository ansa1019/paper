The transformation to digital operations, enabled by the Now Platform, increases our customers’ resiliency and security and delivers great experiences and additional value to their employees and consumers, while we are closely monitoring the unfolding events of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and assessing potential impacts on our business and results of operations in the event of greater global economic disruptions and uncertainty.  We derive contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized through remaining performance obligations (“RPO”), which is subject to variability from factors including foreign currency exchange rates, mix of offerings, subscription start dates, timing of contract renewals and contract duration, and we enter into foreign currency derivative contracts with maturities of 12 months or less to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities, although such hedges cannot entirely eliminate the impact of adverse currency movements.  Our cost of subscription revenues includes data center capacity costs, personnel and support costs to serve customers in regulated markets, and we expect cost of subscription revenues to increase as we support growth in our offerings and evolving data residency requirements.  To support our strategic initiatives, we invest in capital and other resources to expand our data centers and enable our workforce, we acquire technology and businesses to supplement our technology portfolio, and we incur operating lease arrangements for facilities, while maintaining positive operating cash flows for more than ten years and generating free cash flow, which, together with cash, cash equivalents and investments, we believe will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months and to continue funding our operations, growth and capital commitments.

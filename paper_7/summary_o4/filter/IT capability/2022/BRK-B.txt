Berkshire Hathaway manages its diverse operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis with few centralized or integrated business functions, with senior corporate management ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of each operating business’s chief executive, thereby fostering operational flexibility and rapid decision making. The company’s long-term orientation is reflected in its effort to “produce pre-tax underwriting earnings … over the long term,” its policy that “maintaining ample liquidity is paramount” and its insistence “on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments,” as well as its practice of holding substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury bills to absorb strain from volatility. Management acknowledges that “the COVID-19 pandemic affected our operating businesses in varying ways and degrees,” that “significant disruptions of supply chains and higher costs emerged in 2021 and persisted in 2022,” and that it “cannot reliably predict future economic effects of these events on our businesses” or on future consumption patterns, demonstrating an awareness of environmental perturbations and the need for adaptability. In its insurance operations, it distinguishes underwriting and investing activities—unit managers make underwriting decisions while Warren E. Buffett and corporate investment managers make investing decisions—and evaluates underwriting performance “without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses,” considering such gains and losses as non-operating because they believe “they are not meaningful in understanding the periodic operating results,” which embeds risk mitigation and clarity of accountability into its organizational practices. The company further defines risk thresholds—“we currently consider pre-tax incurred losses exceeding $150 million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant”—and continuously re-evaluates liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, recognizing that “changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses … can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results,” thereby demonstrating systematic scenario-based assessments that support the maintenance of integrity and performance under internal or external disturbances.

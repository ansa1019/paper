During 2022, AMD undertook major strategic actions to absorb strain and preserve or improve its functioning under challenging conditions, completing the acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando to expand its technology and product portfolio, diversify its markets and strengthen its business model; despite a weak PC market in the second half of the year, net revenue grew 44% to $23.6 billion, driven by a 64% increase in data center segment revenue and significant embedded segment growth, reflecting its ability to respond to environmental disruptions and maintain performance. The company bolstered its financial resilience by increasing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments from $3.6 billion to $5.9 billion; issuing $1.0 billion of senior notes; establishing a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility and a $3.0 billion commercial paper program; and managing working capital through proactive inventory builds for advanced process nodes, prepayments under long-term supply agreements and timing of payables, thereby reinforcing liquidity and operational flexibility. AMD continued to execute its product technology roadmap with new leadership compute engines, accelerators, adaptive SoCs and ecosystem software, highlighting its capacity for innovation, reconfiguration and adaptation to varying market demands. Although the COVID-19 pandemic persisted as an external pressure, the company experienced limited operational disruptions and continued to monitor public health measures to ensure business continuity. The realignment of reporting segments to strategic end markets and forward-looking belief in sufficient funding sources—including cash flows, committed credit facilities and market access—underscore AMD’s systemic perspective, strategic resilience strategies and trajectory toward sustained integrity and performance amid volatility and uncertainty.

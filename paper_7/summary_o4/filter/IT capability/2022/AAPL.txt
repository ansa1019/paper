In response to unprecedented measures taken during the COVID-19 pandemic, including travel restrictions, business closures and quarantine orders that significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused volatility and disruption in financial markets, the company has maintained operational continuity by leveraging its cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities balance of $156.4 billion as of September 24, 2022, together with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program; it has structured noncancelable manufacturing purchase obligations of $71.1 billion based on demand information covering up to 150 days and fixed lease payment obligations of $15.3 billion across corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail facilities, ensuring resource deployment and operational flexibility; management increased its share repurchase authorization from $315 billion to $405 billion and raised its quarterly dividend, reflecting strategic resource reconfiguration to preserve performance under volatile currency and market conditions; investments in research and development rose 20 percent year-over-year, driven by headcount-related expenses and engineering program costs, demonstrating commitment to innovation and dynamic capability development; segment management on a geographic basis allows tailored responses to unique market dynamics, aligning distribution partners and customer needs with localized strategies; and the companyâ€™s financial and operational decision-making under internal and external pressures is underpinned by critical accounting estimates based on historical experience and reasonable assumptions, enabling the maintenance of integrity and performance despite uncertainties such as variable foreign exchange impacts, realized losses on debt securities, unfavorable fair value adjustments and uncertain tax positions.

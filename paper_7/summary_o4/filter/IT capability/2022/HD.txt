During fiscal 2022, the company undertook strategic investments to promote higher in-stock levels and pull forward merchandise in response to ongoing global supply chain disruption, along with continued investment in new supply chain facilities, reflecting efforts to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adverse conditions. Online sales grew by 7.4% as a result of ongoing investments to enhance digital platforms and related fulfillment capabilities, supporting an interconnected retail strategy and operational flexibility. The company generated $14.6 billion of cash flow from operations and, based on $2.8 billion of cash on hand, funds available under a $5.0 billion commercial paper program, expanded back-up credit facilities and access to long-term debt capital markets, believes it holds sufficient liquidity not only for operating requirements, debt payments and contractual obligations but also to invest in the business, fund dividend payments and share repurchases, while retaining the ability to obtain alternative financing if necessary. A disciplined approach to capital allocation, which prioritizes business reinvestment followed by dividends and excess cash returned to shareholders, may be adjusted to support operations, enhance long-term strategic positioning or respond to economic conditions. Inventory management actions, initiated in fiscal 2021 and moderated in the second half of fiscal 2022, reflect targeted resource deployment to support demand and business continuity, and the use of operating and finance leases to fund real estate needs for stores, distribution centers and support centers further contributes to operational continuity and resource reconfiguration. These measures underscore the companyâ€™s capacity for positive adjustment, maintenance of system integrity and continuity of performance under challenging conditions.

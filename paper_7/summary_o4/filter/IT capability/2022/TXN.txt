In line with the scholarly definition of organizational resilience as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions (Vogus & Sutcliffe, 2007), TI designs and manufactures semiconductors globally and has structured its long-term strategy around strengthening and leveraging four sustainable competitive advantages—namely, a low-cost, high-control manufacturing and technology foundation; a broad analog and embedded processing portfolio; extensive market channel reach that enhances knowledge of customer needs; and diversity and longevity of products, markets and customer positions—to absorb economic fluctuations and preserve performance under adversity. We make our investments with an eye toward long-term strengthening of these advantages, maintain discipline in capital allocation through selective R&D project funding, capacity expansions and cash returns, and pursue operational efficiency to generate resilient free cash flow per share. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent market correction, we continue to manage our operating plan and expenses with a steady hand, remain cautious about future economic conditions and monitor potential impacts on our operations. By owning substantial manufacturing capacity and spreading fixed costs over variable output, we sustain margins across fluctuating demand and, in anticipation of longer-term capacity needs and incentives under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, plan higher capital expenditures to reinforce manufacturing and technology competitiveness. Our primary liquidity source is cash flow from operations, supplemented by cash, short-term investments and an undrawn revolving credit facility, and we believe these resources and operating plans will fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividends and debt obligations for at least the next 12 months. Through disciplined issuance and retirement of long-term debt, strategic share repurchases and dividend payments, we reconfigure our capital structure to maintain flexibility under varying conditions, while critical accounting estimates for income taxes and inventory valuation reflect ongoing risk assessment and readiness to adjust reserves as market, tax and technological factors evolve.

In recognition of an increasingly complex and evolving global security environment, we have adopted an overarching vision to integrate new and existing systems across all domains with advanced, open-architecture networking and operational technologies to make forces more agile, adaptive and unpredictable. We sustain this vision through strategic initiatives including the development of differentiating technologies, forging of strategic partnerships (including cooperative partnerships, joint ventures and equity investments), and execution of a multi-year business transformation to enhance our digital infrastructure, increase efficiencies and collaboration throughout our organization. Underpinning these efforts is substantial investment in our talent and culture, through targeted training to ensure requisite technical skills and the internal development of innovative technologies aligned with rapidly evolving mission requirements. We continuously evaluate our portfolio and pursue selective acquisitions, divestitures and internal realignments to ensure resource allocation supports current and future customer needs. To preserve business continuity amid external pressures such as COVID-19, inflation and geopolitical conflict, we actively engage with customers to protect employee health, mitigate supply chain disruptions through accelerated payments of $1.5 billion and deployment of resources at supplier sites, monitor capacity constraints, and factor heightened inflation into contract pricing (including economic price adjustment clauses). We also evaluate capacity at operations and supply chains to anticipate demand surges resulting from global events, while taking measures to enhance our cybersecurity defensive posture. Where necessary, we realign our organizational structure, as evidenced by strategic reviews leading to targeted severance and asset impairment actions to improve operational efficiency and better align cost structures with changing economic conditions and program lifecycles. Our contract management processes include ongoing identification and monitoring of technical, schedule and cost risks, which inform profit-booking rates and cash collection strategies, while maintaining access to credit facilities and liquidity to support operational flexibility. We have further reduced financial volatility and improved long-term resilience through pension risk transfer transactions, transferring $4.3 billion of defined benefit obligations in 2022 to an insurance company, thereby preserving system integrity and performance under internal variations and disturbances. Collectively, these measures exemplify our organizational resilience, enabling the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions and the preservation or improvement of functioning despite the presence of adversity.

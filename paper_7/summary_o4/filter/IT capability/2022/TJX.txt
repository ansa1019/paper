TJX’s management discussion describes several measures reflecting its ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including the introduction of open-only comparable store sales metrics during the COVID-19-related temporary store closures and the planned return to historical comp-store definitions in fiscal 2024, demonstrating performance maintenance amid external disruptions. The company routinely employs inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the earnings impact of foreign currency exchange rate variations, recognizes mark-to-market adjustments against cost of sales until inventory receipt, and monitors transactional foreign exchange effects, all of which support risk mitigation and system integrity. Strategic resource allocation is evidenced by sustained investments in supply-chain infrastructure, distribution centers, offices, store renovations and new stores, together with adherence to disciplined capital expenditure plans funded by internally generated cash, cash reserves and available credit facilities to preserve business continuity and liquidity. Operating flexibility is further underscored by adjustments to SG&A expense ratios—driven by reductions in COVID-related payroll and incentive compensation costs—by leveraging government programs, and by proactive debt management through use of operating cash flow and cash on hand to repay indebtedness while monitoring market conditions. The ongoing stock repurchase program and dividend policy, including adjustments for the excise tax under the Inflation Reduction Act, reflect strategic foresight and stakeholder engagement. Finally, the use of the retail method for inventory valuation—incorporating markdowns and shrinkage estimates—and the systematic evaluation and accrual of uncertain tax positions and loss contingencies preserve financial accuracy and resilience under internal and external variations.

Bank of America’s management has established a comprehensive risk framework and formal risk appetite, approved annually by the Board and the Enterprise Risk Committee, to identify, measure, monitor and control the seven key categories of risk—strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational—and embeds risk management into strategic, capital and financial planning processes.  The corporation employs contingency planning, including a capital contingency plan, a financial contingency and recovery plan and a resolution plan, to prepare for adverse economic, financial or market stress, and conducts regular enterprise‐wide stress testing of capital and liquidity under multiple macroeconomic scenarios.  A robust liquidity risk management program maintains global liquidity sources of cash and high‐quality unencumbered securities, diversified funding through a stable deposit base and secured financing, and contingency funding plans to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral requirements.  Capital management integrates the internal capital adequacy assessment process with forward‐looking stress forecasts, ensures surplus above regulatory buffers under Basel III and supplementary leverage and TLAC requirements, and allocates capital to businesses based on risk‐adjusted methodologies.  Interest rate risk in the banking book is managed through asset‐liability management activities, hedging with derivatives and securities, and net interest income sensitivity analysis under alternative rate‐shock scenarios.  Trading risks are overseen by independent market risk teams that set quantitative limits, daily VAR monitoring and backtesting, scenario analysis and model validation to manage exposures to interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity, commodity and liquidity stresses.  Operational and compliance risks, including those arising from cyber‐attacks, third‐party dependencies and business continuity threats, are managed under enterprise policies, three lines of defense and ongoing control assessments, supported by a global information security program focused on preparing for, preventing, detecting, mitigating, responding to and recovering from threats, and by comprehensive third‐party risk standards to maintain availability of critical operations.  Climate‐related physical and transition risks are integrated into the risk governance process, with clear roles and a dedicated policy framework to identify, measure, monitor and control exposures stemming from extreme weather events, policy and market shifts and emerging environmental regulations.  Collectively, these governance structures, processes and resources enable the corporation to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning and maintain operational continuity under challenging conditions in furtherance of organizational resilience.

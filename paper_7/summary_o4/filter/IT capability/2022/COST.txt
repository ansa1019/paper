We believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to changing economic and competitive conditions by adjusting our pricing and merchandise mix—including increasing the penetration of our private‐label items—and expanding our online offerings, while employing merchandising and pricing strategies such as sharing cost increases with suppliers, earlier‐than‐usual bulk purchases, seasonal merchandising adjustments and measured cost pass‐through to members, as well as selectively reducing or holding prices to drive sales and maintain competitive value. Our membership format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue, and our warehouse growth and e-commerce expansion strategies seek to mitigate the negative aspects of new openings and evolving sales channels over time. We focus on controlling costs—particularly in areas partially outside our control such as health care and utilities—and on preserving organizational health and operational flexibility through compensation levels above industry averages to reduce employee turnover and enhance satisfaction. Liquidity resilience is rooted in robust operating cash flows, cash and short-term investments and available credit facilities, which we believe are sufficient to meet our foreseeable liquidity and capital requirements, and in disciplined capital expenditure planning to finance new and remodeled warehouses primarily through internal resources. Our risk‐mitigation framework includes self-insurance funding, a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, reinsurance programs and targeted insurance coverage to limit exposures, with liabilities estimated using historical claims experience and actuarial assumptions. We maintain opportunistic stock repurchase programs, conservative leverage management through debt repayments and ongoing evaluation of critical accounting estimates and off-balance-sheet arrangements—all reflecting a systemic perspective on preserving integrity and performance under internal or external variations and disturbances.

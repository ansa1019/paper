Tesla produced 1,369,611 consumer vehicles and delivered 1,313,851 consumer vehicles in 2022 despite ongoing supply chain and logistics challenges and factory shutdowns, illustrating an ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adversity. The company continues to ramp production, build new manufacturing capacity and expand operations to enable increased deliveries and deployments of its products, including production launches at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas, while mitigating bottlenecks through a more even regional mix of vehicle builds and increased exports from Gigafactory Shanghai, reflecting systematic adaptation and reconfiguration of resources in response to disruptive events. Teslaâ€™s focus on increasing vehicle production, capacity and delivery capabilities, improving battery technologies, enhancing full self-driving features, increasing affordability and efficiency, and optimizing servicing and charging infrastructure demonstrates operational flexibility, resource reallocation and business continuity strategies under external pressures such as component constraints, labor shortages, inflationary and regulatory uncertainties, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In its energy generation and storage segment, the company scales deployments of Megapack and Powerwall products, maintains adequate battery cell supply, improves installation capabilities and hires skilled electricians to support demand variability and project milestones, further preserving performance under complex situations. Cash flow and capital expenditure management, including generating net positive operating cash flow, maintaining self-funding capacity, adjusting capital and operating expenditures according to manufacturing scale and macroeconomic conditions, and utilizing revolving credit facilities and debt repayments, exemplify strategic tools for resilience, ensuring adequate liquidity in the short and long term. Inventory valuation practices, warranty reserve estimates and revenue recognition policies underscore risk mitigation, internal control and resourcefulness that uphold integrity and performance maintenance in nominal, extreme and exceptional conditions.

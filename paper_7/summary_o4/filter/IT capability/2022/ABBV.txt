Following the closing of the Allergan acquisition in 2020, AbbVie implemented an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization and as a result realized $2.5 billion of annual cost synergies in 2022, reflecting the company’s ability to reconfigure resources and preserve performance under challenging conditions. In response to the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, AbbVie maintained business continuity by ensuring patients received an uninterrupted supply of essential pharmaceuticals, suspending aesthetic operations in Russia and allocating all profits there to humanitarian relief efforts, while acknowledging that further escalation could adversely impact operations. In response to COVID-19, AbbVie continued to closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources and monitor clinical trial sites locally to protect participant safety and ensure uninterrupted medicine supply, recognizing that evolving factors such as new variants and mitigation measures create uncertainty in its results of operations. To support long-term sustainable growth, AbbVie’s 2023 strategic objectives include maximizing benefits of a diversified revenue base, leveraging its commercial strength and international infrastructure, investing in its pipeline, generating substantial operating cash flows to fund research and development and return cash to shareholders while reducing debt, thereby enhancing its operational flexibility and resilience. AbbVie monitors economic conditions and customer creditworthiness, establishes allowances for credit losses over the contractual life of receivables and, if necessary, utilizes factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, underscoring its risk-mitigation and resource-allocation processes. The company maintains a $4 billion revolving credit facility, remains in compliance with covenants and believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt or raise capital on acceptable terms to meet liquidity requirements, illustrating its preparedness and adaptive financial management. AbbVie also revalues contingent consideration liabilities at fair value each period based on the probabilities of achieving specified milestones, discount rates and estimated future sales, and applies actuarial assumptions in determining its defined benefit and other post-employment obligations, demonstrating ongoing evaluation and reconfiguration of financial commitments under uncertain external conditions.

Since 2008, we have invested more than $10.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products, including the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities in pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, and post-market studies; in November 2022 we acquired Swedish Match AB to create a global smoke-free combination and in January 2023 we rearranged our operations from six to four geographic segments to support the growth of our smoke-free business, reinforce consumer centricity, and accelerate innovation and deployment; concurrently, in November 2022 we relocated our corporate headquarters from New York to Stamford to streamline operations and enhance organizational coherence; in response to the war in Ukraine our main priority has been the safety and security of our more than 1,300 employees and their families—evacuating and relocating thousands, continuing salary payments and in-kind support, temporarily suspending commercial and manufacturing operations, resuming retail activities where safety allowed and supplying the market from production centers outside the country; we have similarly suspended planned investments and scaled down manufacturing in Russia while continuously assessing evolving regulatory and international constraints; we continue to evaluate these disruptions’ material adverse impacts, including potential impairment charges; strategic repositioning has also included ending our U.S. IQOS commercialization relationship with Altria to reacquire full rights, and establishing a long-term, flexible performance-review collaboration with KT&G covering worldwide commercialization of smoke-free devices through 2038, thereby enhancing our operational flexibility and adaptability in evolving market conditions.

Goldman Sachs has implemented a comprehensive resilience framework that combines business continuity planning, liquidity and funding policies, risk management and governance processes to preserve or improve firm functioning under adverse conditions.  The firm’s business continuity planning (BCP) and operational resilience program are designed to ensure continuity of client service and timely settlement across all major financial centers in the event of internal or external disruptions.  Liquidity risk is managed by pre-funding projected cash and collateral needs through Global Core Liquidity Assets (GCLA), maintaining diversified secured and unsecured funding with appropriate tenor profiles, and executing regular stress tests—both short-term (30-day scenarios) and long-term—that incorporate firm-specific and market-wide stresses.  A detailed contingency funding plan assigns clear responsibilities, identifies triggers and outlines specific mitigants for liquidity crises, including sudden collateral demands and credit drawdowns.  Asset-liability management involves a rolling three-year balance sheet plan, overseen by senior committees, that aligns projected asset composition with funding strategies and capital usage limits.  Market risk is monitored daily via value-at-risk, earnings-at-risk and scenario analyses across interest rate, equity, currency and commodity exposures, supported by independent price verification and strict limit governance.  Credit risk controls include standardized underwriting criteria, continuous counterparty assessments, netting and collateral arrangements, and stress testing for sovereign and sector shocks to mitigate default risk.  Operational risk is overseen by a firmwide committee that enforces self-assessments, event-capture systems and cyber-security defenses to address process failures, fraud and system outages.  Model risk is managed through independent review, validation and approval of quantitative tools.  All elements of this framework are subject to regular board and risk-committee review, ensuring the firm maintains positive adjustment and robust performance in challenging or exceptional conditions.

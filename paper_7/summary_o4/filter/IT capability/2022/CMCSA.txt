In 2022, the Company’s resilience was manifested through strategic operational changes and resource investments, including capital expenditures that “increased 9.2% to $7.6 billion, reflecting increased spending on line extensions, scalable infrastructure, support capital and customer premise equipment,” and recommencing investments in content to “continue to invest in content and grow our customer base during 2022,” while forming a consolidated joint venture to develop and offer a streaming platform and launching SkyShowtime. Management noted that “covid-19 has impacted our businesses in a number of ways, affecting the comparability of periods included in this report,” and that “the continuing effects of covid-19, in addition to worsening U.S., European and global economic conditions and consumer sentiment, may adversely impact ... our results of operations over the near to medium term,” yet maintained “significant availability under our revolving credit facility and our commercial paper program to meet our short-term liquidity requirements” and expects “to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements … through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing credit facility; and our ability to obtain future external financing.” The Board approved a $20 billion share repurchase program, during which it “repurchased a total of 332 million shares … and raised our dividend by $0.08,” underscoring financial flexibility. Despite recording $8.6 billion of goodwill and long-lived asset impairments in the Sky segment “primarily reflected an increased discount rate and reduced estimated future cash flows as a result of macroeconomic conditions in Sky’s territories,” the Company continues to fund multiyear programming and production obligations “with the cash generated from our operations,” remains in compliance with leverage covenants, and anticipates focusing 2023 capital expenditures on “increased investment in scalable infrastructure … and in the continued deployment of wireless gateways,” thereby preserving integrity and performance in the face of extreme conditions and environmental disturbances.

Bank of America’s strategic and financial operating plans, under annual board approval and guided by a clearly defined risk appetite, integrate forward-looking stress testing, contingency funding, recovery planning and preferred single-point-of-entry resolution strategies to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. In response to internal or external variations—including market volatility, funding disruptions or operational failures—the firm holds a diversified liquidity buffer of high-quality unencumbered assets, maintains access to multiple funding sources, and conducts regular scenario analyses and backtesting to assess potential cash-flow and capital impacts. Its enterprise risk management framework, supported by three lines of defense, requires business continuity and crisis management routines, including well-tested contingency funding plans, capital and liquidity stress tests, and enterprise-wide model validation, all designed to preserve integrity and performance under stressed and extreme scenarios. Tactical measures such as dynamic capital allocations, hedging of interest-rate, foreign exchange, credit and mortgage risks, active management of loan portfolios and reserves, and specialized operational risk controls—encompassing cybersecurity, transaction monitoring and new-product governance—ensure organizational flexibility, resource reconfiguration and adaptation to unforeseen events. Corporate governance processes continuously monitor emerging strategic, credit, market, liquidity, operational and reputational risks, embedding resilience into decision-making, resource deployment, and inter-organizational collaboration so that the institution can absorb strain and emerge stronger from adversity.

Bristol-Myers Squibb experienced a significant setback when CheckMate-026 in first-line lung cancer returned negative results, prompting the company to reconstitute its development trajectory and elect not to pursue an accelerated regulatory pathway for the Opdivo+Yervoy combination, while simultaneously expanding its IO portfolio through multiple combination regimens across 35 tumor types in order to preserve and improve functioning under adversity. In October 2016, the company announced an evolution to its operating model, focusing commercial and R&D resources on key brands and markets, delivering leaner administrative functions and streamlining its manufacturing network to reflect the importance of biologics, thereby configuring the strategic, financial and operational flexibility necessary to invest in its highest priorities. Acquisition and licensing transactions were leveraged to concentrate resources on growth opportunities that drive the greatest long-term value, while divestiture gains, partnerships and collaborations enabled the reallocation of capital and capabilities. The company maintains governance processes and formal review and certification procedures under its SEC consent order to monitor inventory levels and limit sales to direct customers, complemented by a business risk and disclosure group and external consultancy work to re-engineer accounting and reporting processes, thus strengthening business continuity and risk mitigation. Looking ahead, Bristol-Myers Squibb will continue to implement its biopharma strategy by driving growth of key brands, executing product launches, investing in biologics manufacturing capabilities, supporting a culture of continuous improvement and refining its operating model, all of which systematically enhance its capacity to adapt to unexpected situations, manage external and internal pressures, and maintain performance amid environmental and market perturbations.

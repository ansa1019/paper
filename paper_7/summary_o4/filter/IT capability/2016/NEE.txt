NEE and its subsidiaries have structured extensive financial, operational and regulatory frameworks to maintain continuity of operations and preserve function under adverse conditions. The companies maintain substantial discretionary liquidity through multi-year revolving credit and letter of credit facilities, capital support guarantees and surety bonds to ensure availability of funds for working capital, storm restoration, rate-regulated cost recovery mechanisms and transmission and distribution investments. A centralized Exposure Management Committee oversees commodity, interest rate and credit risk, with formal value-at-risk models and master netting agreements applied to derivative instruments used to hedge fuel, energy, interest rate and foreign currency exposures and to optimize the value of generation and gas infrastructure assets. Regulatory assets and liabilities, including securitized storm-recovery cost deferrals and nuclear decommissioning and plant dismantlement reserves, are recognized based on approved ratemaking studies, supporting rate base stability and enabling recovery of long-term investment. Capital initiatives, such as incremental wind, solar and gas capacity additions, combined with diversified funding sources—including operating cash flow, long- and short-term debt issuances and equity contributions from differential membership investors—support strategic growth and adaptability to market and environmental perturbations. Credit ratings and related covenants influence cost of capital but do not constrain dividend payments or credit facility access under normal conditions, while risk management policies require additional collateral posting in the event of rating downgrades, further mitigating liquidity risk. Guarantee arrangements and indemnities issued on behalf of subsidiaries facilitate commercial transactions, engineering, procurement and construction agreements, power purchase contracts and trading activities, with the parent entity recognizing liabilities only when probable. These combined practices reflect a systematic approach to resource allocation, risk assessment, operational flexibility and financial resilience, enabling the organization to absorb strain and maintain performance despite internal or external disturbances and to reconfigure its trajectory toward future objectives.

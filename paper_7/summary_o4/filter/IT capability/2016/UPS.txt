While the worldwide economic environment remained challenging—characterized by mixed industrial production, currency fluctuations, Brexit uncertainty and soft business investment—management continued to adjust air capacity and cost structure in its integrated transportation network to better match prevailing volume levels, leveraging a broad portfolio of product offerings and the flexibilities inherent in that network to adapt to changing trends. The company undertook initiatives to improve flexibility and capacity, enhance yield management, increase operational efficiency and contain costs across all segments, including facility automation projects and accelerated deployment of its on-road integrated optimization and navigation system (“ORION”) to increase network capacity and improve operational efficiency, flexibility and reliability, as well as utilization of newly expanded operating facilities to improve time-in-transit in each region. In its U.S. domestic package operations, productivity improvements were realized through adjusting air and ground networks to better match volume levels and employing ORION to contain average daily vehicle miles, while redirecting SurePost volume to optimize delivery density; disciplined revenue management—including base rate increases, dimensional weight pricing changes and fuel surcharge index adjustments—enabled dynamic response to shifts in customer and product mix, fuel price volatility and accelerating e-commerce and omni-channel retail demands. Internationally, the company managed uneven global growth and currency movements through base rate increases, fuel surcharge index modifications, currency hedging gains and selective network enhancements to sustain service continuity and cost efficiency, while maintaining export volume growth across Europe, Asia and the Americas. In its supply chain and freight segment, organizational resilience was reinforced by strategic acquisitions of Coyote Logistics and Marken to broaden forwarding and logistics capabilities, by optimizing purchased transportation spend as buy-sell spreads shifted, and by balancing volume decreases in air freight with growth in mail, retail, aerospace, healthcare and automotive solutions—all underpinned by activity-based costing for precise expense allocation and the use of adjusted financial measures for resource allocation and performance analysis. Across the enterprise, self-insurance reserve management, restructured pension and postretirement health and welfare plans, negotiated collective bargaining agreements and capital commitments—such as firm commitments to purchase fourteen Boeing 747-8F cargo aircraft—illustrate proactive risk mitigation, resource deployment and investment in system integrity to preserve or improve functioning despite adversity, consistent with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

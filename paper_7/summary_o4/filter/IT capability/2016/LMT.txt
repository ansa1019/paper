We operate in an environment characterized by both “increasing complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally,” and a significant component of our strategy in this environment is to “focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S. and international customers at affordable prices.”  Recognizing that our customers are “resource constrained,” we are “endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner with a focus on adjacent markets close to our core capabilities, as well as growing our international sales,” while driving “affordability initiatives” and continuing to “invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers and invest in our people so that we have the technical skills necessary to succeed without limiting our ability to return substantially all of our free cash flow to our investors.”  We continuously “strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers” through “independent research and development activities and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities,” and we routinely “conduct discussions, evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, ventures and equity investments” to reconfigure and redeploy our resources in response to shifting market conditions.  Under “U.S. government funding constraints,” we describe how “continuing resolution financing” may delay procurement and potentially affect backlog, orders, sales, earnings and cash flows, yet we mitigate those risks through a funded backlog and by the ability to “fund customer programs ourselves pending government appropriations,” thereby preserving business continuity.  In managing individual contracts, we “identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract,” such that “profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks” or decrease when estimated costs rise, with any changes recognized “in the current period” to reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes.  To support operational flexibility and resilience, we maintain “a balanced cash deployment strategy to enhance stockholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise,” we generate “strong operating cash flows” to fund operations, capital expenditures, debt service, dividends and share repurchases, and we have “access to credit markets” (including a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility and commercial paper) and letters of credit to ensure we can honor customer advance payments and performance guarantees.  We expect that “cash from operations will continue to be sufficient to support our operations and anticipated capital expenditures,” and we manage our defined benefit pension plans under both FAS and CAS standards to buffer against discount‐rate and investment‐return variability by using prepayment credits and adjusting contributions to preserve plan integrity.  We also oversee environmental remediation under government agreements by recording liabilities and corresponding receivables as costs become “probable” and “reasonably estimable,” relying on U.S. government contract pricing to recover allowable expenditures.  Finally, we test goodwill and indefinite‐lived intangibles annually (or more frequently if indicators arise) to ensure that the carrying values of acquired assets continue to reflect fair value, thereby adapting our financial reporting to withstand changes in market factors and preserve organizational health.

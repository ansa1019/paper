PepsiCo’s annual report describes a “performance with purpose” strategy embedded into its business and strategy, which it cites as critical to sustaining performance under volatile environmental and geopolitical conditions and to positioning the company for long-term, sustainable growth.  Since 2012, our productivity agenda has delivered approximately $1 billion in annual savings through cost-saving measures ranging from developing agricultural technologies to sourcing more goods locally, and we continue to embrace automation, skills upgrading and job retraining to navigate geopolitical uncertainty and unrest.  We monitor a variety of key indicators—including organizational health, innovation, productivity savings and environmental metrics—and pursue “environmentally responsible business practices” such as water conservation, replenishment and energy efficiency, packaging reduction, waste cutting and sustainable farming to streamline costs, reinvest savings and ensure business continuity in the face of climate change, water scarcity and regulatory pressures.  Our focus on shifting our portfolio toward healthier products through organic innovation and strategic mergers and acquisitions, and on collaborating with retail and foodservice partners and investing in digital and e-commerce capabilities, reflects our efforts to adapt to changing consumer demand and external pressures.  To address political, economic and social instability in certain markets, we deploy targeted cost-mitigation actions, including risk-based pricing, supply-chain diversification and working‐capital optimization, and we adapt our legal and accounting treatment—as with our deconsolidation of Venezuelan operations—to preserve financial and operational flexibility.  The report further details an integrated risk‐management framework to “identify, assess, prioritize, address, manage, monitor and communicate” strategic, financial, operational, compliance, safety and reputational risks, with board‐level oversight and designated committees, a cross-functional PepsiCo Risk Committee chaired by the CEO, division and country risk committees, a centralized Risk Management Office, corporate audit of internal controls and a compliance & ethics department.  In the normal course of business, we manage commodity-price, foreign-exchange and interest-rate risks through productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and the use of hedging instruments, thereby maintaining our integrity and performance despite external variations, and we believe our cash-generation capability, diversified funding sources and disciplined capital allocation will provide adequate liquidity and resilience under unexpected or extreme conditions.

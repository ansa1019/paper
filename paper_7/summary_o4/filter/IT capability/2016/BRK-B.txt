Berkshire Hathaway describes an organizational model managed on an unusually decentralized basis, with essentially no centralized sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human-resources functions and minimal headquarters involvement in day-to-day operations, while senior management maintains ultimate responsibility for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities, chief executive selection for each operating business and the establishment and monitoring of corporate governance practices to set the “tone at the top” and resolve governance issues. The company underscores the importance of maintaining ample liquidity, safety over yield and a strong capital base as a margin of safety against market volatility, and it uses redundant liquidity measures and disciplined capital deployment to preserve operational continuity through internal or external disturbances. Recognizing that investment and derivative gains and losses can cause significant volatility in reported earnings, Berkshire refrains from relying on such gains for performance evaluation, instead emphasizing underwriting discipline—rejecting inadequately priced risks, limiting exposures through quota-share and excess-of-loss treaties, employing retroactive reinsurance treaties with defined aggregate limits and amortizing deferred charges over anticipated claim-payment periods—to mitigate financial stress and adapt to evolving loss emergence patterns. In its insurance operations, management continually reestimates liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses—subject to internal or external variations such as catastrophe losses, casualty loss tails and foreign exchange fluctuations—and adjusts reserve and discount assumptions as actual claim settlements and revised actuarial inputs develop. In its railroad, utilities, energy, manufacturing, service, retailing and finance businesses, the company responds to declining volumes or structural market changes by adjusting employment levels, containing costs, pursuing productivity improvements, acquiring or divesting assets, and planning significant capital expenditures to be funded by operating cash flows and debt issuances, reflecting a systemic perspective on resource deployment, operational flexibility and strategic adaptation to environmental perturbations, regulatory constraints and evolving market conditions.

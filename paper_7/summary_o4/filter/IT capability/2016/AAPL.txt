Apple’s discussion identifies forward-looking statements as reflecting “current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions” and acknowledges that actual results may differ significantly due to risks and uncertainties. It states that “focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace,” and that its investment policy “generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.” The company believes its “existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months” and “anticipates the cash used for future dividends, the share repurchase program and debt repayments will come from its current domestic cash, cash generated from on-going U.S. operating activities and from borrowings.” To manage financial risks, Apple has “entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on the notes” and “into currency swaps to manage foreign currency risk,” and its share repurchase program “does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares” and may be executed via open market transactions or Rule 10b5-1 plans, providing operational flexibility. The company “accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability” under its iPhone upgrade program and “enters into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers,” maintaining directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to mitigate legal exposures. Management “bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions,” regularly reviews “its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired,” and “performs a detailed review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels and component cost trends.” It also “reviews its manufacturing-related capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable” and “accrues for estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees” related to its procurement commitments. Warranty liabilities are accrued “based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim and knowledge of specific product failures” and adjusted as necessary, while revenue is recorded net of “estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs.” Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent “it is more likely than not that forecasted income … will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets,” and liabilities for legal contingencies are recorded when “it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable.” Through these policies—covering resource allocation, risk mitigation, operational flexibility, and continuous reassessment—Apple demonstrates system resilience and its ability to maintain performance and continuity under varying internal and external conditions.

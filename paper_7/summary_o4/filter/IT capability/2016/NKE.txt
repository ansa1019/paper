Management emphasizes the continuous maintenance of business continuity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions by driving operational excellence across product design, manufacturing efficiency and supply chain configuration—“investing in new technologies that increase automation, help reduce waste and have long-term potential to increase both customization of our products and speed to market”—and by managing working capital efficiency and effective capital deployment to safeguard profitability. The company cites its resilience to “significant foreign currency headwinds” and volatile markets through a global foreign exchange risk management program that centrally manages transactional exposures on a portfolio basis, leverages natural currency offsets, implements hedging via derivative instruments and utilizes the Nike Trading Company and a foreign currency adjustment program to absorb currency strain and preserve financial stability. To further mitigate translation risks, subsidiaries deploy excess cash into U.S.-dollar investments and enter into cash flow hedges, with the hedging policy “designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged.” Liquidity management practices—including maintaining $5.5 billion in cash, equivalents and short-term investments, access to committed credit facilities and a $2 billion commercial paper program, strategic tax planning and the option to repatriate or indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings—are disclosed as means to secure capital needs and sustain operations in the face of external pressures. The narrative also describes adaptive responses to supply chain disruptions such as West Coast port congestion by incurring higher air-freight costs to ensure product flow, and records targeted investments in infrastructure, consumer-focused digital capabilities and direct-to-consumer channels that collectively reflect the organization’s dynamic capabilities, resource reconfiguration and operational flexibility intended to preserve performance under adverse conditions.

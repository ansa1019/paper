We describe a history of adapting our business to external pressures—such as currency fluctuations and rapidly changing gasoline prices—through adjustments to pricing strategies and merchandise mix, including increasing private-label penetration, thereby absorbing strain and preserving performance. We invest in information-systems modernization, fund accelerated vendor payments in advance of system implementation and deploy resources to open and remodel warehouses—29 openings and four relocations in 2016, with plans for up to 31 new locations in 2017—demonstrating operational flexibility, resource reconfiguration and preparedness under evolving conditions. Our membership format, designed to reinforce loyalty and generate recurring fee revenue, coupled with maintenance of “pricing authority,” rigorous cost-control measures (notably in health care and utilities) and targeted preopening and expansion capital expenditures, supports business continuity and competitive advantage. We manage liquidity and capital through cash flows from operations, maintenance of cash and short-term investments, bank credit and letter-of-credit facilities, strategic debt issuances and repayments, and share repurchase programs, illustrating resource generation and risk mitigation. A consistent multi-geographic operating model, LIFO inventory valuation to align current costs with revenues, actuarial estimation of self-insurance liabilities, systematic impairment testing of long-lived assets and critical judgments in revenue recognition and deferred tax planning are disclosed as mechanisms to maintain system integrity and sustain performance amid environmental perturbations and organizational change processes.

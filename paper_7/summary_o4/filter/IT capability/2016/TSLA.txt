During 2016, we scaled production and gained operational efficiencies, increasing production volume by 64% year-over-year and greatly ramping Model X delivery despite challenges with part shortages, while substantially completing the design and prototypes of Model 3 and projecting to start production and deliveries in the second half of 2017 to generate incremental demand. Through our acquisition of SolarCity, we integrated solar energy systems and energy storage production, reclassified historic energy storage products revenue, and introduced solar roof and second-generation Powerpack 2 and Powerwall 2 offerings, thereby reconfiguring our capabilities to preserve integrity and performance under environmental perturbations. We continue to invest heavily in capital expenditures—between $2.0 billion and $2.5 billion ahead of Model 3 production—including the construction of Gigafactory 1 and Gigafactory 2 in partnership with Panasonic to integrate battery material, cell, module and pack production in a single facility, while recognizing that the size and complexity of these undertakings may result in cost overruns or extended timelines. To accommodate a much larger fleet and maintain service continuity, we expanded our sales, service and charging infrastructure worldwide—opening new Tesla retail and service locations, growing our Supercharger network to 790 locations with a net book value of $207.2 million—and deployed asset-based credit facilities and warehouse agreements to support our direct leasing programs and resale value guarantees, thereby managing liquidity risk, deferring revenue appropriately and absorbing strain under varying market conditions. We increased headcount by 15% in research and development and 61.3% in selling, general and administrative functions, invested in over-the-air software updates and improved autopilot hardware, achieved cost improvements through material cost reductions and enhanced inventory control, and reduced warranty expense through better product reliability, all of which reflect our ongoing adaptation and resource reconfiguration to sustain firm performance under external pressures. We continually assess foreign currency exposures, tax positions and supplier arrangements, evaluate working capital needs associated with inventory and deferred revenue balances, and project capital expenditure requirements to support our target of producing 500,000 vehicles in 2018, demonstrating our commitment to the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

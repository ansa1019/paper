Tactical Opportunities seeks to capitalize on complex and dislocated market situations across asset classes, industries and geographies in a broad range of investments, illustrating Blackstone’s ability to reconfigure resources and benefit from sudden disruptive change. Despite this volatile start, U.S. equities later rallied on signs of improving economic growth, a recovery in oil prices and confidence around stabilization of currency and growth outlook in China, demonstrating Blackstone’s capacity to adjust positively under challenging conditions. Revenues in our credit segment increased in 2016 as compared to 2015, driven by improved performance in our performing debt and distressed debt portfolios, with particularly strong performance in our energy investments, reflecting the firm’s adaptability and competitive advantage in responding to environmental perturbations. Our real estate funds remained active in both realizations and deployment, though activity decreased moderately compared to 2015, and in our real estate debt funds liquid fund performance continued to improve in the fourth quarter of 2016, recovering from the general market softening earlier in the year, underscoring operational flexibility and recovery mechanisms. Despite challenging market conditions in early 2016, demand for products in hedge fund solutions remained strong throughout the year, and the segment operates multiple business lines, manages strategies that are both long and short asset classes and generates a majority of its revenue through management fees, all of which provide a level of downside protection and business continuity. Despite the continuing low interest rate environment in 2016, our credit funds were able to identify attractive investment opportunities by focusing on transactions where our scale and expertise granted us a competitive advantage, particularly in the performing and distressed credit markets, highlighting strategic foresight and resilience strategies. Blackstone is not a capital or balance sheet intensive business and targets operating expense levels such that total management and advisory fees exceed total operating expenses each period, and we expect that our sources of liquidity—operating cash flows, carried interest and incentive income realizations and fund realizations—along with our committed revolving credit facility and senior notes, will be more than sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, illustrating a systemic perspective on risk mitigation, resource allocation and preparedness to maintain integrity and performance under internal or external disturbances.

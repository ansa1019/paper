In its management’s discussion and analysis, the company identifies and monitors a wide range of internal and external pressures—such as macroeconomic slowdowns, uncertainty in the European Union and China, sovereign debt default risks, geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, pandemics and political instability—that could impair consumer travel demand and disrupt its operations, and it employs a systemic perspective to preserve performance and positive adjustment under challenging conditions by hedging currency fluctuations with derivative instruments, maintaining substantial cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments, and preserving undrawn capacity under a $2 billion revolving credit facility. It allocates resources dynamically by investing in technology infrastructure, mobile platforms, data centers and personnel to support global expansion across six primary brands, reconfigures its merchant and agency transaction models to absorb volatility in payment terms, cancellation rates and seasonal timing differences between advertising expense and revenue recognition, and expands accommodation supply to enhance competitive advantage and service innovation. The company pursues resilience strategies through performance and brand advertising to drive gross bookings and gross profit despite margin pressures, explores strategic initiatives such as acquisitions, share repurchases, debt issuances and indefinite reinvestment of international earnings for tax planning, and maintains accruals for contingencies including travel transaction tax liabilities and legal disputes—all measures designed to ensure operational flexibility, resourcefulness and continuity, manage risk, and enable the organization to emerge stronger from disruptive events.

In 2016, we continued to focus on our strategy to improve our business by strengthening our competitive position and improving our financial performance, including closely managing operating expenses, reducing debt and extending debt maturities, and executing capital issuances—$690 million of common stock and $805 million aggregate principal amount of 2.125 percent convertible senior notes due 2026—to repay $230 million of our secured revolving line of credit and repurchase $796 million of outstanding senior notes, thereby enhancing liquidity and operational flexibility. We executed our roadmap by delivering a number of new products and technologies across our computing and graphics and enterprise, embedded and semi-custom segments—such as new desktop and mobile APUs, professional GPUs with liquidVR support and 7th generation A-series processors—which reflects our capacity to innovate and adapt to evolving customer needs and market demands. In further support of operational resilience and market expansion, we entered into joint ventures with Tongfu Fujitsu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. and Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co., Ltd., licensing portions of our intellectual property, contributing engineering and technical support, and structuring equity investments to reconstitute product development capabilities and expand our presence in the server product market in China. To mitigate supply-chain and technology risks, we executed a sixth amendment to our wafer supply agreement with GlobalFoundries Inc., establishing a comprehensive framework for collaboration on the 7 nm technology node, granting limited waiver rights to contract with alternative foundries for certain 14 nm and 7 nm products, and ensuring transition assistance to maintain business continuity through December 2020. Amid uncertain global economic conditions, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, supported by our secured revolving line of credit and access to the capital markets, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures and working capital needs, while ongoing covenant compliance and contingency planning preserve our ability to operate under adverse external pressures. Concurrently, we implemented restructuring plans—including a global headcount reduction of approximately 5 percent, outsourcing of certain IT services, application development and the exit of our dense server systems business—to simplify our organizational footprint, align resources with strategic priorities and enhance cost efficiency, thereby reinforcing our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity.

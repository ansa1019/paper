During 2016, Merck continued to execute its innovation strategy and the company’s sustained investment in research yielded a number of recent approvals and regulatory milestones across various therapeutic areas. While growth in key franchises was largely offset by generic and biosimilar competition, business development remained an important component of the company’s overall strategy as Merck sought to identify the best external innovation to augment its portfolio and pipeline, with a particular focus on early-to-mid-stage assets, and to support its in-line portfolio and upcoming product launches. During the past year, the company continued its focus on productivity improvements, looking for opportunities to reallocate resources across the portfolio to grow its strongest brands and to support its most promising assets, which drove declines in marketing and administrative expenses as the company prioritized resources to the highest growth areas. Merck remains financially disciplined, pursuing business opportunities capable of contributing to long-term growth and sustainable value for shareholders, and its strong financial profile enables it to fund research and development, focus on external alliances, support in-line products and maximize upcoming launches while providing significant cash returns to shareholders. The company manages the impact of foreign exchange rate and interest rate movements on its earnings, cash flows and fair values through operational measures and various derivative instruments, has established revenue hedging, balance sheet risk management and net investment hedging programs to protect against volatility, and maintains a conservative investment policy to ensure high credit quality for its cash and investments. Cash provided by operating activities continues to be the primary source of funds to finance operating needs, capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends, and the company capitalizes inventories produced in preparation for product launches sufficient to support initial market demand. Merck also incurs substantial costs for restructuring program activities related to productivity and cost reduction initiatives and the integration of acquired businesses, actions that include the elimination of positions, rationalization of its global real estate footprint, sale or closure of certain manufacturing and research facilities, and consolidation of office sites, with the company expecting to substantially complete these actions by the end of 2017. The company records accruals for contingencies and environmental liabilities when a liability is probable and reasonably estimable, and actively remediates environmental contamination at its sites. Overall, these strategic initiatives, resource reallocation, risk mitigation measures and disciplined financial management support Merck’s ability to maintain performance and adapt its operations in the face of external pressures and evolving market dynamics.

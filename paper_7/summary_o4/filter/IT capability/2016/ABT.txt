Abbott’s decision to sell AMO reflects the company’s proactive shaping of its portfolio in line with its strategic priorities, and over the last three years margin improvement was driven primarily by manufacturing and distribution process changes, lower commodity costs, and other cost reductions, although such improvements were offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange in 2016; the diagnostics business continued to execute on efficiency initiatives in the manufacturing and supply chain functions and initiated the launch of next-generation systems designed to increase efficiency by running more tests in less space, generating test results faster and minimizing human errors; Abbott regularly analyzes historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs, monitors the credit worthiness of customers in geographies such as Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece and establishes allowances for uncollectible receivables, and periodically utilizes factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk; anticipating and financing the acquisition of St. Jude Medical, Abbott issued $15.1 billion of long-term debt in November 2016 and entered into interest rate swap contracts totaling $3.0 billion to convert fixed obligations to variable obligations, obtained and repaid bridge term loan facilities, and maintains unused lines of credit of $5.0 billion to support liquidity and commercial paper programs; in response to Venezuela’s exchange-rate regimes, Abbott concluded it was appropriate to move to the DICOM rate in 2016, recorded a $480 million foreign currency exchange loss to revalue its net monetary assets, and continues to remeasure and report these assets each quarter with any additional losses not expected to be material; Abbott funds defined-benefit pension plans (contributing $582 million in 2016) and expects pension funding of approximately $364 million in 2017; working capital increased to $20.1 billion at December 31, 2016, reflecting a $13.6 billion increase in cash and equivalents and $1.8 billion reduction in short-term borrowings from long-term debt proceeds and operating cash flow, which Abbott expects to continue exceeding capital expenditures and dividends, thereby preserving its investment-grade ratings and maintaining resources for ongoing integration, product launches, and efficiency initiatives.

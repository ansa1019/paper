In its Management’s Discussion and Analysis, KKR emphasizes the firm’s structured approach to risk mitigation and resource reconfiguration in response to external pressures, noting that periods of market volatility and dislocation—such as those following the United Kingdom’s referendum to withdraw from the European Union—while presenting substantial risks, also afford opportunities to invest at reduced valuations and thereby enhance the firm’s capacity to maintain positive adjustment and firm performance under challenging conditions. The discussion highlights the adaptive allocation of capital and liquidity—including hedging of foreign currency exposures and the use of credit financing—to preserve continuity of operations and support future growth despite fluctuations in global equity, credit and commodity markets, reflecting systemic flexibility and operational resilience. KKR further underscores its multifaceted resilience strategies through diversification across private equity, infrastructure, real assets, alternative credit, public and capital markets, dynamic adjustments to fee structures and investment horizons, collaboration with strategic partners, and ongoing investments in human capital and incentives to sustain organizational health, adaptability and crisis management capabilities in a complex, turbulent business environment.

Management’s discussion and analysis underscores the company’s commitment to maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions by investing significant management attention and resources in its information technology infrastructure, privacy and security capabilities, and evolving connected services offerings, while recognizing forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. As the company continues transitioning to offer more connected services, the ongoing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important, and we implemented additional security measures in our products and began working with state governments to share information regarding suspicious filings, thereby reinforcing operational continuity and mitigating external pressures. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, commitments, debt service requirements, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months, and we evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies, leveraging our strong liquidity profile to respond nimbly to disruptive events. The company’s disciplined approach to business combinations under the acquisition method—with refinements of provisional fair-value estimates over a one-year measurement period to reflect new information—alongside annual and interim goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing that compares carrying amounts to expected cash flows ensures rigorous risk assessment and adaptive reconfiguration of financial trajectories. Collectively, these initiatives reflect the firm’s ability to absorb strain, preserve functioning under nominal and extreme variations, and transform itself to emerge stronger from adverse or exceptional conditions.

Netflix’s MD&A discloses strategic and operational measures reflecting organizational resilience, including its continued acquisition, licensing and production of content to support global expansion, the construction and operation of its own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) to efficiently stream high volumes of content, and dynamic pricing and plan-mix adjustments to absorb unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations and evolving consumer behavior. Marketing and content expenses are managed across domestic and international segments, fluctuating with new territory launches and multi-year commitments to exclusive and original programming that expanded contractual content obligations by $3.6 billion to $14.5 billion as of December 31, 2016, demonstrating long-term strategic planning and resilience to supply disruptions. The company anticipates that cash flows from operations, together with available funds and access to financing sources, will continue to be sufficient to meet cash needs for at least the next twelve months, despite increased upfront investments in original content that may result in future negative free cash flows after material global profitability, exemplifying business continuity planning, risk assessment and strategic foresight. Technology and development expenses increased 31% to $852.1 million in 2016, driven by higher personnel-related costs and cloud computing expenses to test, maintain and modify streaming delivery technology and infrastructure, reflecting organizational capability building and adaptation, while general and administrative expenses increased to support international expansion and production of original content, highlighting resource allocation, operational flexibility and adaptive process reconfiguration, as further evidenced by a change in content asset amortization in response to revised viewing patterns.

Starbucks’ fiscal 2016 results continued to demonstrate the strength of our global business model and our ability to successfully make disciplined investments in our business and our partners (employees), with operating margin expansion primarily driven by sales leverage and lower commodity costs, partially offset by investments in partners and digital platforms. Through our seven strategies for growth, we plan to expand our footprint by opening new stores and enhancing the mix and types of stores in our portfolio, coupled with continued customer attachment through our morning and lunch dayparts, while our management team aligns leadership with evolving businesses including global roastery and Starbucks Reserve® branded stores. We actively manage our cash and investments to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, pursue acquisitions and return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, maintaining an investment portfolio of highly liquid available-for-sale securities to preserve capital and liquidity. In fiscal 2016 we replaced our 2013 credit facility with a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and maintain a $1 billion commercial paper program, both available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, with no outstanding borrowings and full compliance with all covenants as of October 2, 2016. In May and February 2016 we issued long-term senior notes totaling $1.25 billion, the net proceeds of which will be used to enhance our sustainability programs around coffee supply chain management and to support our growth agenda. We expect to use our available cash and investments, including potential future borrowings, to invest in capital expenditures for new company-operated stores and store renovations, systems and technology investments, partner and digital initiatives, manufacturing capacity and strategic acquisitions, believing that future cash flows and existing liquidity both domestically and internationally will be sufficient to finance our core businesses and shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $4.6 billion in fiscal 2016 versus $3.7 billion in fiscal 2015, primarily due to increased earnings, the lapping of the non-cash acquisition-related gain for Starbucks Japan and the timing of our cash payments for income taxes, while cash used by investing and financing activities reflected higher purchases of investments, acquisition-related payments, debt issuances and redemptions and increased cash returned to shareholders. We manage market risk arising from commodity price volatility, foreign currency exchange fluctuations, equity security price changes and interest rate variability under our market price risk management policy, using pricing features in supply contracts and financial derivatives to hedge coffee and dairy price risk, derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency exposures and interest rate hedges as appropriate, setting annual risk limits to prohibit speculative trading activity and monitoring counterparty credit risk.

We have continued to drive organizational resilience by investing in product innovation, enhancing our distribution and service capabilities, and realigning our service operations through a multi‐year platform simplification strategy and workforce optimization effort to upgrade clients from legacy platforms to modern cloud‐based solutions. Despite pressures from foreign currency translation, evolving regulatory complexity and elevated losses on legacy platforms, we delivered strong new business bookings, maintained high client revenue retention and increased recurring revenues, demonstrating our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions. Our service organization has adapted to new solutions and strategic platforms, our sales force has reconfigured resources to support growth, and we have selectively disposed of noncore assets (such as the AMD business) to sharpen our focus. We have sustained our system integrity and performance by maintaining a strong business model with high recurring revenues, robust margins, consistent healthy cash flows, low capital expenditures and solid credit ratings. Our financial resilience is supported by $3.2 billion of cash and equivalents, a laddered client funds investment strategy emphasizing safety of principal, liquidity and diversification, a $9.25 billion committed credit facility, and a short‐term commercial paper and reverse repurchase program to mitigate liquidity risk. The introduction of $2 billion of senior notes and disciplined capital deployment—including share repurchases and dividends—increases our strategic flexibility and positions us to respond effectively to environmental disruptions, preserve organizational health, and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

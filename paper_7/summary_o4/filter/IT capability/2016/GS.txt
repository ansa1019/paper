In our forward-looking statements, we include information about the objectives and effectiveness of our business continuity plan, information security program, risk management and liquidity policies, as well as our resolution plan and resolution strategy and their implications for our debtholders and other stakeholders. We continued to maintain strong capital ratios and liquidity, while returning $7.20 billion of capital to shareholders during 2016. In the context of the challenging environment during the first half of 2016, we completed an initiative that identified areas where we can operate more efficiently, resulting in a reduction of approximately $900 million in annual run rate compensation; for 2016, net savings from this initiative, after severance and other related costs, were approximately $500 million. One of our risk management disciplines is our ability to manage the size and composition of our balance sheet, and to ensure appropriate risk management we seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid balance sheet and have processes in place to dynamically manage our assets and liabilities, which include balance sheet planning, business-specific limits, monitoring of key metrics and scenario analyses. These processes provide a framework for maintaining liquidity and capital across a variety of situations, including a severely stressed environment; to this end, we maintain global core liquid assets comprised of unencumbered highly liquid securities and certain overnight cash deposits totaling $226.07 billion as of December 31, 2016, held to meet potential cash and collateral needs in a stressed environment and give significant flexibility to manage through difficult funding conditions. Our contingency funding plan provides a framework for analyzing and responding to a perceived or actual capital deficiency, including identification of drivers of a capital deficiency, mitigants and potential actions, and outlines communication procedures during a crisis period, including coordination of internal and external information. As part of capital planning, our stress‚Äêtesting process is designed to identify and measure material risks associated with our business activities and our ability to generate revenues, incorporating both internally designed stress scenarios and those required under the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests (DFAST), thereby ensuring that we have sufficient capital to continue operating during times of economic and financial stress.

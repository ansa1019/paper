The Company discloses that it continues to invest in the development of its services, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth, including the expansion of data center capacity, interconnectivity between data centers and the provision of hosting and support services, data backup and disaster recovery services and upgrades, all of which serve to maintain performance and business continuity under varying operational conditions. Its IT operations management solutions are designed to improve visibility, availability and agility of enterprise services, reflecting operational flexibility and dynamic capabilities to respond effectively to external variations and disturbances. The annual subscription model grants customers access to ordered services and related support over multi-year terms, while professional services revenues are recognized as services are delivered, aligning resource deployment with customer needs and supporting positive adjustment under challenging circumstances. Management uses non-GAAP measures such as billings and free cash flow as indicators of ongoing performance and operational trends, disclosing the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations and billings duration to improve comparability and reduce brittleness in its performance metrics. The Company anticipates that cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet liquidity needs—including data center expansion, lease obligations, headcount growth, fixed asset acquisitions and office investments—for at least the next twelve months and may seek additional equity or debt financing if necessary to support such resilience. The MD&A further notes seasonal patterns and cyclicality in customer agreements, with significantly higher contract signings in the December quarter driven by sales incentives and enterprise budgeting cycles, as well as variations in collections and marketing expense related to the annual knowledge user conference, underscoring the importance of planning and resource management for variability. The Company is also conducting an ongoing evaluation of a foreign currency hedging program to mitigate currency risk in its expanding international operations.

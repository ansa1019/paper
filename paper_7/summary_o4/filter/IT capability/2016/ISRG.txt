In designing our products, we focus on making our technology easy and safe to use, thereby enhancing operational flexibility and resilience by reducing complexity and minimizing the risk of errors that could disrupt functionality. We focus our organization and investments on developing, marketing, and training for those products and targeted procedures where da Vinci can bring patient value relative to alternative treatment options and/or economic benefit to healthcare providers, thereby aligning resource allocation with key strategic objectives and external pressures. Our leasing arrangements for da Vinci systems offer customers flexibility in acquisition, expand surgery availability, and leverage our balance sheet; we have found this program effective and plan to expand it in response to customer demand, demonstrating adaptive continuity in volatile markets. In support of service continuity, during the second quarter of 2016 we leveraged lower cost refurbished endoscopes to meet customer replacement needs, reflecting resourcefulness under cost constraints, and we are preparing to expand our service pool with new endoscopes as our installed base grows. To mitigate safety risks and preserve system integrity, our recalls and corrections process—including documentation, regulatory notifications, customer communication, and field service visits—ensures rapid response to hazards and sustains organizational health and stakeholder trust. We plan to make substantial strategic investments—anticipating up to eighty million dollars in incremental R&D investment in 2017 beyond our typical growth rate—to advance product innovation and support future orientation and organizational adaptation. Our risk assessment and financial resilience practices encompass hedging foreign currency exposures, managing inventory valuations to address obsolescence, maintaining significant cash and investment balances for liquidity, and closely monitoring demand drivers such as healthcare policy shifts, hospital consolidation, reimbursement changes, and competitive dynamics to sustain performance under pressure and enable reconfiguration in response to environmental perturbations. Additionally, we have intensified focus on our overseas markets—investing in distribution infrastructure in Europe and Asia and expecting international revenue and procedure adoption to comprise a growing portion of our business—exemplifying systemic adaptation and long-term resilience.

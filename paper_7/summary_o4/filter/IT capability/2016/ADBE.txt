Management’s strategic acquisitions and integrations, including the integration of Fotolia into the digital media segment and the planned integration of TubeMogul into digital marketing, illustrate the Company’s ability to absorb strain and reconstitute its operating trajectories to preserve or improve functioning under disruptive events.  The ongoing evaluation of assumptions, judgments and estimates underlying critical accounting policies—encompassing revenue recognition, business combinations, goodwill impairment and income taxes—demonstrates a systematic perspective and iterative risk assessment process that adapts to internal and external pressures.  In revenue recognition, management responds to evolving customer and market expectations by expanding and improving technology, providing enhancements and support throughout the customer life cycle, and deploying resource allocation mechanisms for multiple-element arrangements, thereby maintaining operational flexibility and business continuity.  Estimates for future returns, rebates and price protection are based on historical channel inventory levels, sell-through rates and market conditions to mitigate the impact of environmental perturbations.  Hosted services revenue is recognized ratably over contracted terms, aligning service delivery with financial reporting and preserving system integrity.  Purchase price allocations in business combinations require significant estimates of fair value for acquired intangible assets, reflecting organizational intelligence and resourcefulness in the face of uncertainty.  The annual goodwill impairment review employs both qualitative and quantitative analyses—considering macroeconomic conditions, industry trends, changes in strategy and customer behavior—to detect potential performance impairment and ensure resilience against market volatility.  Tax accounting utilizes the asset and liability method with reserves for unrecognized tax benefits and ongoing examinations by domestic and foreign authorities, evidencing adaptive strategies for managing fiscal risks.  Currency hedging programs mitigate foreign exchange variability, protecting performance maintenance under fluctuating rates.  The management of deferred and unbilled revenue backlog across varying contract durations underscores foresight and sustains liquidity.  A $1 billion revolving credit facility with extended maturities, coupled with structured stock repurchase agreements executed at guaranteed discounts, optimizes capital structure, preserves financial strength and enhances strategic agility in turbulent markets.  Investments in network infrastructure, data centers, research and development facilities and strategic technology acquisitions further reflect the firm’s dynamic capabilities to anticipate, confront and benefit from sudden disruptive change.

We are actively monitoring, evaluating and responding to COVID-19 developments, have instituted a global work-from-home policy beginning in March 2020 that did not incur significant disruptions to our work operations, and will continue to adapt our business operations as may be required by governmental authorities or determined to be in the best interests of our employees, end-customers, partners, suppliers and stockholders, with a focus on employee safety, community health and providing technology to support remote work. We believe our portfolio of products, subscriptions and support offerings will enable us to benefit from recurring revenues as we grow our installed end-customer base in over 170 countries and across diverse industries, and that ongoing innovation—demonstrated by the introduction of Pan-OS 10.0 with over 70 new features and targeted acquisitions of Zingbox, Aporeto and CloudGenix—is essential to meeting customer needs and enhancing our competitive position. To manage future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital and processes efficiently. We monitor key financial metrics—such as billings (total revenue plus changes in deferred revenue), deferred revenue (a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods) and cash flow provided by operating activities (driven by product sales and upfront subscription payments)—to evaluate growth trends, assess operational efficiencies and forecast cash needs. We maintain liquidity of $4.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments for general corporate purposes, have an unused $400 million unsecured revolving credit facility, and believe our cash flows and available resources will be sufficient to meet foreseeable needs, while acknowledging that prolonged COVID-19 disruptions, changes in end-customer spending, supply chain constraints or other risk factors could materially affect our business. Our critical accounting policies and estimates—including revenue recognition over service periods, amortization of recoverable incremental contract costs, accruals for manufacturing partner purchase commitments, evaluations of loss contingencies, and assessments of goodwill and intangible asset recoverability—are designed to provide reasonable measurement of our financial position and performance under varying conditions.

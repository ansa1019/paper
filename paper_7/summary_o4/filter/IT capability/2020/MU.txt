Events surrounding the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak have prompted a reduction in economic activity globally and affected demand for certain products, leading us to follow government policies and recommendations designed to slow the spread of COVID-19 and remain committed to the health and safety of our team members, contractors, suppliers, customers, distributors, and communities by implementing health screenings, physical distancing, team separation protocols, equipment upgrades, visitor prohibitions, business travel limitations, remote work arrangements, thermal scanning and mandatory mask usage to maintain operations in a healthy and safe environment. To respond to changing market conditions, we have shifted supply from markets with demand declines, such as smartphones, consumer electronics, desktop PCs, automotive and enterprise, to those with demand increases, including data center, cloud server, notebooks and gaming, evaluated our supply chain and communicated with suppliers to identify supply gaps, added alternative suppliers and increased on-hand inventory of raw materials to ensure continuity, and added assembly and test capacity to provide redundant manufacturing capability through our network of captive operations and external partners. We are evaluating all our construction projects across our global manufacturing operations and enacting protocols to enhance the safety of our team members, suppliers and contractors, have developed strategies and are implementing measures to respond to a variety of potential economic scenarios, such as limitations on new hiring and business travel and reductions in discretionary spending, and are working with government authorities in jurisdictions where we operate to ensure compliance with government requirements, regulations, industry standards and best practices to safeguard our workforce while safely continuing operations across the globe. We believe these actions are appropriate and prudent to safeguard our team members, contractors, suppliers, customers and communities while allowing us to continue operations, though we cannot predict how these steps will ultimately impact our business, outlook or results of operations. We periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment, revising the useful lives of existing equipment in our NAND wafer fabrication and R&D facilities from five to seven years based on planned technology node transitions, capital spending and equipment re-use rates, a revision that reduced depreciation expense and benefited cost of goods sold, and expect underutilization costs at our manufacturing facilities to gradually decline through 2021 as we redeploy equipment and continue to right-size capacity. We continuously evaluate alternatives for efficiently funding our capital expenditures and ongoing operations, and expect that our cash and investments, cash flows from operations and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through the next twelve months, while our board of directors has authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $10 billion of outstanding common stock. To develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality, we continue to invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities and equipment and R&D, and to mitigate credit risk we invest through high-credit-quality financial institutions and limit concentration of credit exposure by restricting the amount of investments with any single obligor.

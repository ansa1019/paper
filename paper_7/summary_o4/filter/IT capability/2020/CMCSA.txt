Despite COVID-19 materially impacting 2020 results of operations, the company reports that our distribution network performed well under the stress of increased traffic and peak usage driven by remote work and learning, reflecting operational flexibility and maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. We incurred costs in compensating personnel who worked to keep our customers connected and implemented programs to waive certain fees and not disconnect services for nonpayment, providing customers with flexible and extended payment options and free internet services, thereby preserving business continuity and absorbing strain. Financing activities, including the issuance and repayment of long-term debt that reduced the weighted-average cost of debt and bolstered liquidity, together with reductions in costs and capital expenditures to conservatively manage cash, demonstrate strategic resource allocation and risk mitigation. We maintain significant availability under revolving credit facilities and commercial paper programs, tested compliance with our leverage covenant by a significant margin without the need to reduce debt or improve operating results, and believe that ongoing cash flows from operating activities, together with existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, available borrowings and future external financing, will be sufficient to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements, illustrating systemic resilience and adaptive capability in the face of adversity.

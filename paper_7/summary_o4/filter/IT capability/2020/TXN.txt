The company emphasizes sustaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions by focusing on three strategic elements: building and leveraging four sustainable competitive advantages—namely a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology that lowers costs and enhances supply-chain control, a broad analog and embedded processing portfolio that deepens customer insight, expansive market channels that facilitate access to more customers and design projects, and product, market and customer diversity that reduces single-point dependency and extends return horizons—and by making investments with an eye toward long-term strengthening of these advantages, exercising discipline in capital allocation across R&D, manufacturing capacity and acquisitions, and pursuing operational efficiency to maximize output per dollar. It further underscores preparedness for extreme and unforeseen disruptions through a longstanding business continuity plan and investments in inventory and a global internally owned manufacturing footprint to enable flexible production across multiple sites, which have helped minimize, though not eliminate, disruptions to operations and order fulfillment. Management reports continuous monitoring and assessment of the dynamic COVID-19 environment and execution of plans to address implications to its business, supply chain and customer demand. Finally, the company affirms that its robust cash flow generation, substantial liquidity sources—including cash, short-term investments and an undrawn revolving credit facility—and forward-looking operating plans provide the financial resources necessary to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, debt service and other business requirements for at least the next twelve months, thereby supporting its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity.

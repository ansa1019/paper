During the COVID-19 pandemic, the company took actions focused on maintaining business continuity, supporting employees, helping customers and communities, and preparing for the future and the long-term success of its business; it experienced a slight decline in new business in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 followed by growth at pre-pandemic rates, and recorded approximately $216 million of impairments to real-estate leasing assets in locations it decided to exit while evaluating office-space needs and anticipating possible additional impairments as it adjusts and refines its strategy. It has implemented strategic realignments and redirected resources from areas no longer aligned with business priorities into key growth areas and to increase investments in go-to-market and product efforts, which included some position eliminations and resulted in incremental operating expenses and lower operating cash flows. The company offered temporary financial flexibility and changed billing frequencies to certain customers, delaying payments, and accelerated investments in go-to-market efforts, such as a partial minimum commission guarantee, negatively impacting cash flows but aimed at ensuring long-term customer retention. It continues to evaluate acquisitions and make investments in complementary businesses, services, technologies and intellectual property rights to expand service offerings and nurture its ecosystem. The organization has experienced and may continue to experience variations from forecasted new business activity due to longer and less predictable sales cycles, increased complexity from an expanded product mix, and global market volatility, including foreign currency fluctuations. It has increased data-center capacity, scaled professional services headcount to meet higher demand and plans to continue investments in infrastructure, including offices, information technology and security measures, while retaining the ability to slow the pace of such investments in response to economic conditions. The company’s liquidity position, including cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable and unbilled contracted revenue, along with a $3 billion revolving credit facility and bridge and term‐loan commitments in support of acquisitions, are expected to be sufficient to meet working capital, capital expenditure and debt‐repayment needs and the cash portion of its pending $15.6 billion acquisition of Slack Technologies.

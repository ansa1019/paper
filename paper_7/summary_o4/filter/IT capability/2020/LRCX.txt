During fiscal year 2020, customer demand remained relatively strong; however, the company experienced COVID-19-related production and supply chain disruptions, which impacted the timing of revenue recognition and negatively impacted gross margin. While improvements are being seen in both the company’s and its suppliers’ operations, risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic remain, which may negatively impact revenue and gross margin. The company continued to make significant R&D investments focused on leading-edge deposition, etch, clean, and other semiconductor manufacturing processes—driven by increases in employee-related costs, outsourcing service costs, and spending for supplies—and leveraged cycles of learning from its broad installed base, maintained a collaborative focus with ecosystem partners, and delivered multi-product solutions to enhance customer value. Recognizing the importance of sustaining levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure, the company increased its cash, cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash and investments balances to approximately $7.0 billion as of June 28, 2020, compared to $5.7 billion as of June 30, 2019, and believes that anticipated cash flows from operations, together with existing liquidity, are sufficient to support operations, investments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, capital redistributions, and dividends through at least the next twelve months. The company acknowledges that uncertainty in the global economy and the semiconductor industry, as well as disruptions in credit markets, have in the past—and could in the future—impact customer demand and its ability to manage relationships with customers, suppliers, and creditors, and therefore maintains access to capital markets and a revolving credit facility to meet funding objectives. To preserve operational flexibility and resource availability, the company manages significant off-balance-sheet purchase obligations related to outsourcing activities, operates non-cancelable facility and equipment leases with options to extend or purchase and guarantees residual values up to $250 million, and periodically reevaluates uncertain tax positions, deferred revenue deferrals, and other long-term obligations, all of which underpin its capacity to absorb strain, maintain integrity of performance, and adjust positively under challenging conditions.

During the year we adapted our operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by conducting business with substantial modifications to employee work locations and travel, and by becoming an approved non-bank SBA lender under the Paycheck Protection Program to support small businesses, while acknowledging that, despite no significant operational disruptions to date, we cannot predict the full impact on our operations, demand for our offerings or customer behavior. Our growth strategy and competitive positioning depend on initiating and embracing disruptive technology trends, entering new markets and driving broad adoption of our products and services, supported by significant investments in product development, marketing, sales capabilities and information technology infrastructure, as well as in privacy and security measures, including collaboration with state and federal governments on industry-wide anti-fraud initiatives. We maintain robust liquidity—$7.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments—and flexible credit facilities, including a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, a $400 million unsecured term loan and a $300 million secured revolving facility for small business lending, to meet seasonal working capital requirements, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions (including the pending $7.1 billion acquisition of Credit Karma), debt service obligations and unexpected challenges. As of July 31, 2020, we were compliant with all covenants, and we believe our financial resources and credit capacity will allow us to manage potential revenue reductions, payment delays and other operational uncertainties for the foreseeable future.

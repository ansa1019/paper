As the global response to novel coronavirus (“covid-19”) continues to evolve, our primary focus has been the safety and wellbeing of our employees and their families, as well as the seamless functioning of the firm in serving our limited partner investors and our shareholders; in accordance with local government guidance and social distancing recommendations, the majority of our employees globally have been working remotely, and our technology infrastructure has proven to be robust and capable of supporting this model as we have implemented rigorous protocols for remote work across the firm, including increased cadence of group calls and updates, frequent communication across leadership and working levels, and leveraging technology to ensure our teams stay connected and productive and that our culture remains strong even in these unusual circumstances while we continue to closely monitor applicable public health and government guidance. We have multiple sources of liquidity to meet our capital needs, including annual cash flows, accumulated earnings in our businesses, the proceeds from our issuances of senior notes, liquid investments on our balance sheet and access to our $2.25 billion committed revolving credit facility; we expect that our primary liquidity needs will be cash to facilitate the growth of our existing businesses, fund modest capital expenditures, repay borrowings and related interest costs, and pay income taxes, and we believe these sources of liquidity will be more than sufficient to fund our working capital requirements. We may use leverage opportunistically to create the most efficient capital structure for Blackstone and our shareholders, managing reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and securities sold, not yet purchased based on our liquidity needs, market conditions and investment risk profiles, and our board of directors retains discretion to adjust dividends to provide for the conduct of our business, make appropriate investments in our business and funds, comply with applicable law or our debt instruments, and provide for future cash requirements such as tax-related payments and clawback obligations; while our liquidity has not been materially impacted by the pandemic to date, we continue to actively evaluate our sources and uses of liquidity in light of evolving conditions.

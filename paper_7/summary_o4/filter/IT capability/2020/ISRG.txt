In response to the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company implemented a multifaceted resilience strategy focused on health and safety by implementing continuous updates to health and safety policies and processes, supporting customers across clinical, operational, and economic priorities to ensure continuity of supply by working with suppliers and distributors, securing its workforce economically, and continuing to invest in priority development programs while eliminating avoidable spend. The introduction of a customer relief program in April 2020 provided credits against service fees, deferred lease payments, and extended payment terms, reflecting adaptive financial resource allocation and risk mitigation, while programs to monitor and mitigate subsequent credit risks have been put in place. To maintain operational flexibility and cost resilience, the company launched an extended use program for higher-volume instruments increasing uses from ten to twelve-eighteen cycles, underpinned by continuous investments in design and production capabilities to improve quality and durability, and reduced pricing on commonly used instruments. Alternative financing structures, including system leasing and usage-based models, have been expanded to offer customers flexibility in accessing systems, and operating leases have been structured to accommodate changing utilization dynamics as hospitals defer decisions and fill unused capacity. The company leverages internet connectivity of installed systems to collect system logs for enhanced visibility into utilization, recognizing the associated uncertainties and assumptions in estimates, and uses metrics such as installed base, shipments, and utilization for transparent financial and operational decision-making and future planning. Strategic investments, including the acquisition of Orpheus Medical to strengthen an integrated informatics platform for surgical video connectivity and archiving, and the launch of Intuitive Ventures to invest in complementary healthcare innovations, further bolster organizational capabilities and system resilience. Throughout this period, the company has acknowledged the significant complexity and variability of the business environment—driven by regulatory clearances, procedure growth, hospital spending patterns, and competitive pressures—and has focused on preserving or improving functioning under adversity by adapting its operational model, resource allocation, and service innovation to maintain continuity and support recovery.

In fiscal 2020, Lowe’s demonstrated organizational resilience by leveraging its retail fundamentals strategy—merchandising excellence, supply chain transformation, operational efficiency, and customer engagement—to quickly respond to the global health crisis and unprecedented customer demand; the company rapidly enhanced its omni-channel capabilities by rolling out curbside pickup, mobile check-in, an internal order picking app and touch-less BOPIS lockers, continued mobile app enhancements using geofencing technology, and re-platformed Lowes.com to the cloud, greatly improving site stability and functionality and driving triple-digit online sales growth. To maintain operational continuity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions, Lowe’s made a significant merchandising investment to reset U.S. store layouts for faster shopping and localized assortments, launched a new Pro CRM tool to grow and retain professional customers, and unveiled a Total Home strategy to expand products, services and installation capabilities while intensifying localization and online growth. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the company prioritized associate and customer safety through social distancing, plexiglass shields, enhanced cleaning and mandatory masks, financially supported associates with discretionary payments, temporary wage increases and emergency paid leave, and invested $109 million in community relief, reflecting the system’s ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning. The firm maintained ample financial flexibility through strong operating cash flows of $11.0 billion, disciplined working capital management, $4.7 billion of cash and $3.0 billion undrawn revolver capacity, issuance and retirement of $8.0 billion of unsecured notes at lower rates to reduce long-term interest expense (incurring a $1.1 billion loss on extinguishment), robust access to commercial paper supported by credit facilities, a 9% increase in quarterly dividends, and $5.0 billion of share repurchases with $19.7 billion remaining under repurchase authorization. In addition, Lowe’s continued strategic capital deployments—$1.8 billion in fiscal 2020 across existing store investments, strategic initiatives and new facilities—and rigorous risk-mitigation and resource-reconfiguration practices in merchandise inventory reserves for obsolescence and shrinkage, self-insurance accruals using actuarial assumptions, and quarterly reviews of long-lived assets for impairment, thereby reinforcing its ability to adapt, recover and sustain performance under external disturbances and dynamic market conditions.

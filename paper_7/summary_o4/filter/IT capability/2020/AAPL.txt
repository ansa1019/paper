Management discusses the company’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that “COVID-19 has spread rapidly throughout the world… prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures” which have curtailed economic activity and disrupted financial markets, and describing how retail stores and channel partner points of sale were temporarily closed, the workforce transitioned to remote operations, and offices and stores have since been reopened under public health and safety restrictions in accordance with local regulations. The company asserts that its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements “will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements…” over the next twelve months. Management highlights that focused investments in research and development, driven primarily by headcount-related expenses, are critical to future growth and competitive positioning, alongside higher spending on marketing, advertising and variable selling expenses to support demand. The discussion further outlines the issuance of unsecured commercial paper and long-term notes for general corporate purposes, the use of interest rate swaps and foreign currency swaps to manage interest rate and currency risk, and a diversified outsourcing model whereby partners acquire components and build products based on demand information supplied by the company to secure supply and manage purchase commitment cancellation fees. Liquidity disclosures underscore the generation of $80.7 billion of operating cash flow in 2020 and describe the strategic deployment of cash toward property, plant and equipment acquisitions, business acquisitions, share repurchases totaling $72.5 billion, dividends of $14.1 billion, and debt repayments while retaining flexibility to withstand market volatility and external disruptions. Contractual obligations including noncancelable manufacturing and other purchase arrangements, and lease commitments for retail, corporate, manufacturing and data center facilities, are presented to align capacity with operating requirements and preserve system integrity under varying conditions.

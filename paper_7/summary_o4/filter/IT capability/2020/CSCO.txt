In response to the extraordinary conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic, Cisco prioritized supporting employees, customers, partners and communities while positioning the company for the future by enabling a seamless transition to remote work under its long-standing flexible work policy and building technologies to help organizations stay connected, secure and productive, as well as focusing on health and safety for those remaining on-site. The company introduced free offers and trials for its Webex and security technologies to facilitate rapid digitization of operations and remote workforce support, and announced a Cisco Capital business resiliency program leveraging $2.5 billion of available funds to provide up-front 90-day payment holidays and defer 95 percent of payments until early 2021, thereby offering financial flexibility and supporting business continuity and recovery. Inventory and supply chain management remained a strategic focus, as Cisco entered into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers to manage lead times, secure manufacturing capacity and maintain flexibility against internal or external disturbances, balancing competitive lead times with the risk of obsolescence. Ciscoâ€™s strong cash, cash equivalents and investments portfolio was regarded as critical in this period of uncertainty, providing resources for strategic investments, acquisitions, customer financing activities, working capital needs and shareholder returns, supplemented by a $2.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facility to ensure operational flexibility and resilience to market disruptions. The company regularly assesses its financing receivables and guarantees to channel partners and end-user customers, maintains liquidity through free cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation, and believes its liquidity resources will satisfy working capital, capital expenditure, contractual obligations and other capital resource requirements through at least the next 12 months despite ongoing volatility in capital and credit markets.

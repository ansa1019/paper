In 2020, faced with the COVID-19 pandemic’s dramatic economic slowdown and unprecedented supply-chain disruptions, the Company transformed its operations to protect the health and safety of employees, customers, and communities by implementing enhanced safety procedures and policies based on CDC guidelines, employing risk assessments, training, data-driven risk mitigation, and establishing an Operating Practices Command Center to identify causes of mainline service interruptions and develop solutions. Despite significant swings in freight volumes, the Company adjusted demand-driven resources with minimal customer disruption, achieved sequential volume improvements from the second quarter, and continued its operational transformation, which yielded an 8% reduction in freight car terminal dwell, a 6% improvement in freight car velocity, 3% faster average train speed, 14% higher locomotive productivity, and 11% improved workforce productivity. Productivity initiatives, core pricing gains, lower fuel prices, and disciplined resource deployment drove an all-time record 59.9% operating ratio and free cash flow of $3.2 billion, which supported investments in infrastructure hardening and safety resilience initiatives within a capital plan of $2.9 billion. The Company continuously evaluates COVID-19’s impact through scenario analyses informing liquidity planning, maintains sufficient available cash, committed and undrawn credit facilities to sustain extended periods of lower volumes, and expects to continue transforming its railroad in 2021 by increasing service reliability, reducing variability in network operations, improving resource utilization through train-length initiatives and structural changes, and focusing on what it can manage—enhancing productivity, pursuing new business opportunities, and safeguarding stakeholders—to maintain continuity, adaptability, and performance under challenging conditions.

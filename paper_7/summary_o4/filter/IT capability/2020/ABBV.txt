In 2020, following the Allergan acquisition, AbbVie implemented an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization and realize more than $2 billion of expected annual cost synergies over a three-year period, with approximately 50 percent in research and development, 40 percent in selling, general and administrative expenses and 10 percent in cost of products sold, while incurring approximately $2 billion of charges through 2022 for severance, employee benefits and other integration expenses. The company continues to closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources globally to ensure uninterrupted patient access to medicines during the COVID-19 pandemic, monitors clinical trial sites to protect participant and employee safety, collaborates with global authorities and external partners on the experimental use of multiple AbbVie assets and novel antibody therapeutics to address the public health crisis, and donated $35 million to increase healthcare capacity and deliver essential supplies. AbbVieâ€™s long-term strategy focuses on leveraging its commercial strength and international infrastructure to diversify its revenue base, advance and invest in its pipeline across all stages of development, expand operating margins through productivity initiatives in supply chain and ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure and administrative costs, and return value to shareholders via a strong and growing dividend and share repurchase program. The company maintains robust risk mitigation and financial resilience practices by monitoring economic conditions, customer creditworthiness and regulatory developments, establishing allowances for credit losses, utilizing factoring arrangements, accessing a $4 billion five-year revolving credit facility, issuing and redeeming commercial paper as needed, managing debt maturities and interest rate swaps, and revaluing contingent consideration liabilities, thereby preserving liquidity and financial flexibility to fund obligations, support growth objectives and maintain market leadership. In addition, AbbVie employs rigorous governance over its intangible assets and goodwill by conducting qualitative and quantitative impairment assessments when events or changes in circumstances warrant, reviews pension and post-employment benefit obligations using actuarial assumptions and a yield-curve approach for discount rates, and regularly adjusts rebates, chargebacks and other reserves to reflect evolving contract terms, volume trends and legislative changes, enabling the organization to absorb strain and maintain its integrity and performance under internal and external pressures.

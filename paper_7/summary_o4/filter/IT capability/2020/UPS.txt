During 2020, we began implementing our customer first, people led, innovation driven strategy to transform nearly every aspect of our business, enhance capabilities such as speed and ease of access, complete enhancements to our U.S. ground network to improve time-in-transit and deploy our digital access program into e-commerce platforms, demonstrating operational flexibility and future orientation in response to significant demand shifts caused by unexpected business shutdowns and government restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We responded to a reduction in global air cargo capacity and increased market rates by leveraging resource allocation decisions and capacity surcharges, and we updated our cost allocation methodologies for products like ground with freight pricing to better reflect operational activities. To maintain organizational coherence and competitive advantage, we entered into a definitive agreement to divest our UPS Freight business to focus on core parts of our business that drive the greatest value for shareholders, recording impairment charges and classifying assets as held for sale to improve operating margin and return on invested capital. Internally, we supplement GAAP measures with adjusted financial measures used for business unit operating performance analysis, resource allocation and incentive compensation award determination to facilitate strategic initiatives under volatile market conditions. Our liquidity and capital resource disclosures reflect maintaining $6.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, deferring employer payroll taxes under the CARES Act, suspending share repurchases, and evaluating opportunities to optimize capital structure, thereby ensuring the maintenance of business continuity, crisis response preparedness and adaptability to ongoing uncertainty, while acknowledging the inability to reasonably estimate the duration or severity of the pandemic or its impacts on results or liquidity.

Applied Materials’ MD&A highlights its rapid deployment of precautionary measures— including screenings, social distancing, personal protective equipment and remote work arrangements—to keep workplaces healthy and safe and ensure compliance with global restrictions while maintaining essential operations, and describes a multi-phase plan to return to on-site work in alignment with business needs, local regulations and community health trends. The company maintained a minimum on-site workforce to keep critical labs and operations active, continues to monitor and evaluate the ongoing pandemic to respond appropriately across its global operations, supply chains and stakeholder networks, and in response to fluid conditions made adjustments to its global operations while collaborating with employees, customers and suppliers to manage uncertainties and sustain manufacturing capacity. Applied underscores its adaptive planning through strategic investments in research, development and engineering, capital expenditures on demonstration and testing equipment and network improvements, and disciplined liquidity management—leveraging credit facilities, accounts receivable financing and commercial paper programs—to preserve financial flexibility and operational continuity. These measures, together with proactive resource allocation, risk management practices and real-time operational adjustments, serve to bolster the company’s ability to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions, and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have focused on helping people stay connected, assisting the public health response and working on the economic recovery, while continuing to invest based on our major priorities of privacy, safety and security; building new experiences; supporting businesses that rely on our services; and communicating more transparently about our role in the world. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, we experienced significant increases in the size and engagement of our active user base as a result of the pandemic, followed by trends subject to volatility that we believe are returning to pre-pandemic levels, though we are unable to predict these impacts with certainty. The pandemic caused a reduction in demand for advertising and a decline in pricing, particularly in the second quarter of 2020, but also contributed to an acceleration in the shift of commerce from offline to online and increasing consumer demand for products versus services, resulting in increased advertising demand that may not continue as the effects subside. We intend to continue to invest in our business based on our company priorities and anticipate that additional investments in our data center capacity, servers, network infrastructure and office facilities, as well as scaling our headcount to support our growth, will continue to drive expense growth in 2021, with capital expenditures expected to be in the range of $21–23 billion. Under Topic 606, we recognize revenue using a five-step model and perform collectibility assessment, “which uses a probable threshold which requires estimation based on several objective and subjective factors, such as probability of default, customer’s intention to pay, payment history, financial strength, geography, and industry sub-vertical risks,” acknowledging that collectibility has become uncertain due to the economic environment caused by COVID-19. For accounts receivable measured at amortized cost, “we use aging analysis, probability of default methods and incorporate macroeconomic variables that are most relevant to evaluating and estimating the expected credit losses,” which may vary by geography, customer type or industry sub-vertical. We review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, and evaluate our operating leases and other contractual commitments—including multi-year renewable energy agreements with an estimated total spend of approximately $4.94 billion—to secure either volume or price. As of December 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity—cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated from operations—totaled $61.95 billion, which, together with our share repurchase program (with $8.60 billion authorized for repurchases and an additional $25 billion authorized in January 2021), we expect will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs and fund strategic initiatives for the foreseeable future. We are involved in legal proceedings, claims and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations and “accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated” and disclose possible losses when reasonably possible. In April 2020, we paid a $5.0 billion FTC settlement penalty upon the effectiveness of a modified consent order, and in July 2020 we invested approximately $5.8 billion in Jio Platforms Limited at prevailing exchange rates. Collectively, these actions demonstrate our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity, maintain integrity under varying pressures, reconfigure resources and strategies, and emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

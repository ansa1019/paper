Management’s discussion of financial condition and results of operations highlights our ongoing integration of acquisitions—Workfront, Allegorithmic, Marketo and Magento—into our reportable segments and the strategic realignment of our advertising cloud into a new Publishing and Advertising segment, reflecting a reconfiguration of our organizational structure to better align with strategic initiatives and ensure operational flexibility. We fulfill our promise to customers by providing a seamless end-to-end creative or document workflow solution that integrates cloud-based and on-premise features—creative cloud libraries, shared reviews, automatic cloud rendering and Sensei—to enable business continuity across multiple devices and teams and to absorb strain and preserve performance under challenging conditions. Our critical accounting policies involve the regular evaluation of assumptions, judgments and estimates in revenue recognition, business combinations and income taxes, reflecting a systemic approach to risk assessment, resource allocation and uncertainty mitigation. We maintain liquidity and financial resilience through cash, cash equivalents and a $1 billion revolving credit facility, employ foreign currency hedging programs and structured stock repurchase agreements to manage financial risks, and monitor annualized recurring revenue as a key performance metric to assess organizational health and trajectory. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we directed our teams to work from home, suspended travel, replaced in-person events with digital formats and emphasized employee health and safety while serving our customers and ensuring business continuity, actions that demonstrate our capacity to absorb external disturbances, adapt operating parameters and sustain growth in turbulent markets.

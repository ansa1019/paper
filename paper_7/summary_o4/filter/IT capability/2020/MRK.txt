Despite the business challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Merck continued executing on its strategic priorities, reporting year-over-year sales growth, and remained focused on protecting the safety of its employees, ensuring that its supply of medicines and vaccines reaches its patients, contributing its scientific expertise to the development of antiviral approaches, and supporting health care providers and Merck’s communities. During 2020, the company executed on its capital allocation priorities by completing business development transactions and investing in its pipeline, actively monitored the business development landscape for growth opportunities that meet its strategic criteria, and allocated resources to support its commercial opportunities in the near term while making the necessary investments to support long-term growth, including higher clinical development spending and increased investment in discovery research and early drug development. As part of industry-wide efforts to develop solutions to the pandemic, Merck acquired OncoImmune and Themis Bioscience and entered into strategic collaborations with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative to develop antiviral and vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2. The company remains on track to complete the spin-off of Organon late in the second quarter of 2021, thereby creating two companies, each focused on their strengths and portfolios, allowing them to pursue their respective market opportunities and business strategies. Merck continues optimizing its global manufacturing and supply network and reducing its real estate footprint through a global restructuring program expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2023 and to result in annual net cost savings of approximately $900 million by the end of that year. Although COVID-19-related disruptions to patients’ access to health care providers negatively affected results in 2020, Merck believes that global health systems and patients have largely adapted to the impacts of COVID-19, remains confident in the fundamental underlying demand for its products and its prospects for long-term growth, and assumes that ongoing residual negative impacts will persist into 2021. The company manages foreign currency risk through established revenue hedging, balance sheet risk management and net investment hedging programs, and interest rate risk through interest rate swap contracts, to protect against volatility and maintain its performance under internal or external variations. Merck’s strong financial profile enables it to fund research and development, focus on external alliances, support in-line products, maximize upcoming launches and provide significant cash returns to shareholders, thereby reinforcing its capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity.

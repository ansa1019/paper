In our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, we describe leading a transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smoke-free future and ultimately replace cigarettes with smoke-free products, reflecting strategic resilience in responding to environmental disruptions and transforming our business model to emerge stronger from challenging conditions. We manage our business in six operating segments and maintain a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands, thereby deploying a diversified portfolio to absorb market variability and preserve functioning under external pressures such as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation, we reconfigure resources to ensure our smoke-free products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements, including FDA authorizations under the PMTA and MRTP pathways, to maintain business continuity and mitigate regulatory risks. Our net revenues—affected by the volume of products we sell, the price of our products, changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell—illustrate our operational flexibility as we adjust pricing and geographic mix to offset unfavorable volume trends and currency impacts. Cost of sales planning, including estimated costs for device warranty programs, and targeted investments in marketing, administration and research to develop reduced-risk products demonstrate our capacity to allocate financial and operational resources proactively to sustain integrity and competitive advantage. As a holding company, our ability to finance debt service through dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries evidences financial resilience, while the deconsolidation of our Canadian subsidiary reflects recalibration of our asset structure to align with our strategic objectives.

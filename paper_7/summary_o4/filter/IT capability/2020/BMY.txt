In 2020, management noted that the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant risks and disruptions to global health and the economy, introducing volatility in financial markets, currency exchanges and interest rates, increasing supply chain constraints and scarcity of raw materials, and causing sudden and severe economic downturn conditions, yet the company has not incurred significant disruptions to medicine supply and continues to monitor a dynamically changing environment to react to outbreaks by reinforcing workforce safety directives; operating all internal manufacturing facilities and contract manufacturers with proper safety measures, increasing lab staffing where possible, implementing mandatory work-from-home policies, restrictions on travel and in-person meetings, and adapting field-based customer engagement with a remote model while resuming in-person interactions in permissible areas. Despite slight slowdowns in clinical study enrollment and temporary pauses in site activations and laboratory research during the pandemic onset, activities have recommenced under rigorous planning, feasibility assessments and protocol simplifications, with safety, regulatory compliance and data integrity assured. The company also continues to adapt its operating model through commercial, research and manufacturing resource reallocation to prioritized brands and markets, leaner administrative functions, streamlined manufacturing network and vigorous integration of Celgene and MyoKardia, targeting $3 billion of cost synergies through 2022, while driving a culture of continuous improvement for strategic, financial and operational flexibility. To support business continuity and risk mitigation, management regularly assesses working capital, debt maturities, capital expenditures, dividend payouts and share repurchase capacities, maintains multiple credit facilities and a commercial paper program for backup liquidity, and believes existing cash and marketable securities, together with operational cash flow, will satisfy anticipated needs for the next several years. Further, the company has established company-wide policies and governance processes to monitor and limit sales to direct customers pursuant to SEC consent, utilizing weekly inventory and out-movement data from key wholesalers and internal demand forecasting methodologies, and conducts periodic impairment reviews of long-lived assets and goodwill, tax valuation allowance assessments and accruals for contingencies, all reflecting structured mechanisms to absorb strain, preserve functioning under pressure and maintain performance in the face of external and internal perturbations.

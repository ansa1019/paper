Berkshire Hathaway operates its numerous and diverse businesses on an unusually decentralized basis, with senior corporate management responsible for significant capital allocation and investment decisions but with autonomy at the operating unit level. As the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated, revenues and earnings of many businesses declined severely, prompting the implementation of business continuity plans—including temporary closures of nonessential facilities, work-from-home and staggered schedules, enhanced cleaning and health screenings, elimination of nonessential travel and meetings, and general health reminders—to protect employees and customers while maintaining essential operations in railroad, utilities, energy, insurance and other critical services. The company also took a series of actions to mitigate economic losses and preserve financial strength, including employee furloughs, wage and salary reductions, capital spending cuts, divestitures, and restructuring activities to resize operations to fit expected customer demand. The manufacturing segment, notably Precision Castparts, likewise initiated aggressive restructuring measures, including workforce reductions of approximately 40% and inventory and asset write-downs, to align capacity with reduced aerospace build rates and support future margin recovery. BNSF continued to operate as an essential component of the supply chain, leveraging productivity improvements, cost-control initiatives and ample liquidity to sustain operations under volatile conditions. In the insurance segment, underwriting and investment operations were adjusted through premium credits, revised loss estimates, enhanced loss provisions and maintenance of customer service levels, while an emphasis on safety over yield guided short-term investment strategies. Throughout the pandemic, Berkshire’s decentralized structure, significant cash balances, disciplined capital allocation, share repurchase program conditioned on maintaining a minimum liquidity threshold, and ongoing reassessment of goodwill and asset valuations exemplified the organization’s ability to absorb strain, preserve functioning and adapt in the face of adversity.

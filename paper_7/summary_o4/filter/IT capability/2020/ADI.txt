In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and related government restrictions, the company implemented extensive contingency planning to preserve workforce health and operational continuity, including restricting travel, modifying work locations, suspending in-person events and stabilizing supply chain and manufacturing operations across its global footprint. Since the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2020, manufacturing operations and supply chain activity generally returned to normal levels despite the ongoing dynamic environment. Management continuously monitors global macroeconomic conditions and has undertaken various restructuring and repositioning actions—such as workforce realignment to long-term strategic priorities and consolidation of wafer and test facilities—to improve operational effectiveness, reallocate resources, reduce costs and maintain performance under adverse conditions. The company’s principal liquidity sources—including a diversified global cash position, an unsecured $1.25 billion revolving credit facility with financial covenants, and expected cash flows from operations—are managed to ensure sufficient funding for operations, capital expenditures, research and development, strategic transactions and shareholder distributions. Research and development investments, which declined in the near term due to uncertainty but remain central to future growth, are regarded as critical to preserving product leadership and competitive advantage. Inventory levels and accounts receivable are actively managed through demand forecasting and contract accounting practices that incorporate risk assessment of variable consideration, price protection and returns, thereby aligning production with customer needs and mitigating the impact of demand variability. The adoption of new accounting standards for leases and revenue recognition reflects the company’s systemic agility in maintaining financial reporting integrity. Interest rate and foreign currency exposures are hedged with derivatives and forward contracts to reduce market volatility risk, while goodwill and long-lived assets are subjected to periodic impairment assessments using discounted cash flow and market approaches to verify recoverability and fair value under changing operational and economic conditions. Through these coordinated strategic, financial and operational measures, the company seeks to absorb external and internal pressures, preserve or improve functioning, and emerge stronger from challenging situations.

Our discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic notes that while we have been relatively successful in navigating such impact to date, we previously were affected by temporary manufacturing closures, employment and compensation adjustments and impediments to administrative activities supporting our product deliveries and deployments; as part of our response strategy, we instituted cost-reduction initiatives across our business globally commensurate to the scope of our scaled-back operations, including temporary labor cost reductions such as employee furloughs and compensation reductions, suspension of non-critical operating spend and opportunistic renegotiation of supplier and vendor arrangements, and we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate, accurately projecting demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploying our production, workforce and other resources accordingly. We are currently focused on increasing vehicle production and capacity, developing and ramping our battery cell technology, expanding our global infrastructure and introducing our next vehicles, while simultaneously ramping new products, constructing or ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents and piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies—the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall project priority, milestone achievement, production adjustments, capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects. To mitigate potential strain on our vehicle delivery capability, we situate our factories closer to local markets, increase and staff our delivery, servicing and charging infrastructure, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our supercharger locations to ensure cost-effectiveness and customer satisfaction. We continue to ramp production, build new manufacturing capacity and expand our operations to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products and further revenue growth, funding these activities through internally generated cash flows while undertaking capital-intensive projects; we currently expect capital expenditures to be $4.50 to $6.00 billion annually in each of the next two fiscal years. Recognizing uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations—exacerbated by concurrent international projects, the COVID-19 pandemic and industry-wide component constraints—and in future global market conditions resulting from the pandemic, we continually evaluate our capital and operating expenditure needs, may adjust the pace of spending by operating segment and may seek alternative financing sources if necessary. In January 2021, we updated our investment policy to diversify and maximize returns on our cash not required for operating liquidity, investing an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin with plans to accept bitcoin as payment, while acknowledging these digital assets may be subject to volatile market prices that could be unfavorable at the time of liquidation.

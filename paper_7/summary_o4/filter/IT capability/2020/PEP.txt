PepsiCo’s 2020 discussion highlights how the company, in the face of the first global pandemic in a century and broad societal and environmental crises, took immediate steps to protect associate health in order to maintain service to consumers, customers and communities; secured and diversified its supply chain; ensured continuity across manufacturing, distribution and sales; accelerated the strengthening of its e-commerce and digital capabilities; and reimagined marketing to deliver positive outcomes for people, shareholders and the planet.  Recognizing that these extraordinary conditions were overlaid on structural challenges—shifting consumer preferences, intense competition, rapid retail-landscape disruption, macroeconomic and political volatility and evolving regulations—PepsiCo has committed to a “faster, stronger, better” trajectory in which it sustains or improves growth and market share in high-return segments, invests wisely in manufacturing capacity and go-to-market systems, and leverages data analytics for deeper consumer insight; drives holistic cost management to underwrite investments in an agile, flexible end-to-end value chain and broadened global business-services capabilities; reinforces an ownership culture and workforce diversity; and further integrates its purpose agenda by investing in agricultural resiliency, planet-positive resource efficiency and community empowerment.  In parallel, the company continues to monitor and mitigate key risks through an integrated risk management framework—under board and senior management oversight, with cross-functional and country-level risk committees and ongoing audit, ethics and compliance functions—to identify, assess, prioritize, address and communicate strategic, operational, safety, compliance and reputational risks, thereby preserving organizational health, adaptability and continuity under both nominal and extreme external pressures.

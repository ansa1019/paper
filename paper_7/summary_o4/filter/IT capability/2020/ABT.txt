Abbott implemented comprehensive business continuity plans to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, shifting the majority of office-based work to remote operations, instituting rotational on-site staffing and strict health-safety protocols, and aligning internal guidance with evolving governmental orders. The company mobilized cross-functional teams to absorb strain and reconstitute its operational trajectory by developing, securing emergency use authorizations for, and launching a broad suite of COVID-19 diagnostic tests across rapid and lab-based platforms, simultaneously expanding manufacturing capacity and reallocating R&D and capital expenditures to sustain core businesses. Abbott preserved financial resilience by maintaining robust liquidity and credit facilities—including up to $5 billion of unsecured borrowing capacity—prudently managing working capital and allowances for credit and rebate exposures based on historical trends and forward-looking assessments, and strategically optimizing its debt profile through targeted issuances, redemptions and hedging. These measures reflect an adaptive, systemic response that enabled the company to absorb external disturbances, reconfigure resources, and preserve or enhance functioning during an unprecedented global disruption.

Amgen continued to provide uninterrupted supply of its medicines globally through the COVID-19 pandemic by taking appropriate steps to minimize risk to employees and implementing remote working arrangements that have not significantly affected its ability to maintain critical business operations or incur shortages; it continuously monitors study enrollment on an institution-by-institution basis, pausing trials when uncertainty arises to ensure subject safety and data integrity, and its R&D organization has supported the pandemic response through production of therapeutic antibodies, a public-private partnership for coordinated research efforts and participation in platform studies, demonstrating adaptability, inter-organizational collaboration and crisis response mechanisms. The company believes that existing funds, cash generated from operations and sources of financing are adequate to satisfy working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and strategic business initiatives, reflecting prudent liquidity management, risk mitigation and resource allocation practices; it optimizes its capital structure through strategic deployment of cash balances to acquisitions, debt repayment, dividends and share repurchases, maintains access to global markets via a commercial paper program and a syndicated credit facility as a liquidity backstop, and hedges net foreign currency exposure and interest-rate risk to offset exchange-rate volatility, thereby preserving operating flexibility and financial resilience. Amgen’s human capital resource management is designed to attract, motivate and retain talent with compensation, benefits and development programs aligned with shareholder interests, and a diverse and inclusive culture that fosters innovation and strengthens its global presence, underscoring the importance of organizational capabilities and social capital. The company has a long-standing ambition for environmental sustainability, met or exceeded its 2013–2020 targets for carbon, water and waste reductions while growing revenues and capacity, and announced long-term goals through 2027 to achieve carbon neutrality, reduce water consumption by 40% and waste by 75%, reflecting future orientation, system integrity and strategic resilience initiatives. Despite external pressures from the pandemic, biosimilars and generics, Amgen advanced its innovative pipeline, integrated newly acquired products, expanded internationally, disciplined capital allocation and hedged financial exposures, evidencing its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions.

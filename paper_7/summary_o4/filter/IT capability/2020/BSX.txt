In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Boston Scientific’s global crisis management team focused on protecting employees and customers, optimizing operations and securing the supply chain, successfully implementing business continuity plans including establishing a medical advisory group for employees, leveraging work-from-home infrastructure to facilitate social distancing, limiting sales visits to critical cases and accelerating capabilities to provide remote physician support; as elective procedures were deferred and certain manufacturing sites were temporarily closed or operated at reduced levels, the company aligned its build plans to current and expected demand, later resuming normalized production levels and adopting a tiered approach for employees to return on-site—prioritizing those with the greatest need for on-site resources while enabling others to continue remote work—alongside cost reduction initiatives encompassing decreases in travel, meetings, customer events, hiring, clinical programs and certain research and development projects, a temporary four-day work week and executive compensation cuts, which were subsequently reversed as conditions improved. Management evaluated the recoverability of balance-sheet assets in accordance with authoritative accounting literature, considering revised forecasted sales, customer demand and macroeconomic factors to make good-faith estimates of impairment indicators for accounts receivable, inventory, investments, intangible assets and goodwill, and continued to monitor for indicators of impairment through the filing date. To safeguard liquidity under uncertain economic conditions, the company utilized existing cash and cash equivalents, access to capital markets and credit facilities, completed equity and debt offerings, pre-paid term loans, refinanced and amended credit arrangements, slowed planned capital expenditures and established a cross-functional strategic cash management team to optimize fund allocation and preemptively amend financial covenants. While acknowledging the negative impact of procedural delays, pricing declines and operational downturns, management affirmed its long-term fundamentals remain strong and committed to executing its mission of transforming lives through innovative medical solutions, thereby preserving organizational integrity and performance and positioning the company to emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

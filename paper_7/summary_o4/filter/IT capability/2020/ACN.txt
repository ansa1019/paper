The discussion of the Company’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates its capacity for maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including a rapid shift of approximately 95% of its global workforce to a remote working environment, suspension of business travel and the phased development of plans to safely return personnel to client and Company offices, all designed to ensure continuity of operations and service delivery. Management describes proactive workforce planning—monitoring utilization, adjusting hiring and involuntary terminations, calibrating compensation by skill set and geography—to align headcount and talent supply with shifting client demand, and adjusting the mix of services, pricing and resource deployment to mitigate margin pressure. The Company notes its ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions by reallocating resources toward high-demand areas such as digital transformations, cloud adoption and security services, while managing reduced demand in other industries. It further highlights strategic risk-mitigation mechanisms, including currency protection provisions and hedging programs to preserve financial performance amid foreign exchange volatility, and its confidence that cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity will satisfy funding requirements over the next twelve months. The flexibility of its share repurchase program and its use of contractual indemnities, critical accounting judgments and tax planning further reflect the organization’s broader resilience strategies to preserve integrity and performance under uncertainty.

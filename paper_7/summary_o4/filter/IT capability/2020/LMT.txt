Lockheed Martin’s discussion of 2020 and 2019 outlines a series of strategic and operational responses that enabled the company to absorb strain and preserve functioning under the extreme pressures of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions. Early in the crisis, the company invoked its designation as part of the defense industrial base to keep U.S. production facilities operating, adjusted F-35 production schedules in response to supplier delays, and implemented health-and-safety protocols—including personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning, social distancing, alternate work schedules and teleworking—to sustain critical program execution. Lockheed Martin proactively monitored its global supply chain, accelerated progress-payment remedies afforded by the U.S. government and prioritized cash payments to impacted suppliers, including small businesses, in order to mitigate delivery delays and preserve business continuity across its aeronautics, missiles and fire control, rotary and mission systems, and space segments. Concurrently, the company maintained program quality and predictability through affordability initiatives, continued investment in technology innovation and workforce skills, disciplined portfolio shaping into adjacent markets, and growth of international sales. Financially, Lockheed Martin generated strong operating cash flows, preserved access to credit markets via a $2.5 billion revolving facility and commercial paper, and executed a balanced capital deployment strategy—including discretionary pension contributions, capital expenditures, independent research and development, selective acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases—to bolster liquidity and strategic flexibility. To reduce future funding volatility, it transferred portions of its defined benefit pension obligations through buy-out and buy-in annuity contracts, and it managed market and environmental risks through foreign-exchange and interest-rate hedges as well as cost-reimbursable arrangements for remediation liabilities. These measures collectively reflect the firm’s ability to adapt organizational practices, reconfigure resource allocation and sustain performance under challenging and uncertain conditions.

KKR’s management discussion and analysis discloses that the firm has confronted the outbreak of COVID-19 and attendant economic contractions, market volatility and geopolitical uncertainties by continuously monitoring global and regional economic conditions and assessing their impact on investment valuations, exit strategies, fundraising and capital deployment, thereby seeking to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Management highlights the firm’s ability to invest opportunistically during periods of market dislocation—deploying capital at reduced valuations to position for future growth—and to mitigate risk through measures such as near-term commodity price hedges in its energy real asset portfolio. KKR has preserved business continuity and operational flexibility by diversifying across private equity, core, real assets, credit, impact and hedge fund strategies, reaching new investor segments, adapting fee structures in post-investment periods, and maintaining a robust liquidity framework that emphasizes cash flow from operations, investment income, carried interest realizations, committed credit facilities and debt issuances. The firm systematically allocates resources to warehouse and syndicate transactions, supports new investment vehicles, underwrites capital markets commitments and manages contingent obligations—including indemnifications and carried interest clawback provisions—to safeguard its organizational strength and protect net asset value under both nominal and extreme conditions, all while balancing stakeholder distributions, dividend policy and capital return requirements.

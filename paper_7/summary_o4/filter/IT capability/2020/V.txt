Visa has actively monitored the global spread of COVID-19, prioritized the safety of our employees, clients and communities, taken a measured approach to workforce continuity by maintaining remote work arrangements and phased office returns, and remained in close contact with stakeholders to help navigate these challenging conditions. In response to operational uncertainty, we have modified business practices and reduced operating expenses through scaled hiring plans, travel restrictions, marketing spend reductions and optimized use of external resources, and continue to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on volumes, transactions and revenue. Our treasury policies provide guidelines for liquidity risk management, with regularly evaluated budgets and forecasts of cash requirements for operations, commitments, capital expenditures and litigation settlements, and access to multiple liquidity sources—including $7.7 billion of cash and available-for-sale securities, a $3 billion commercial paper program, a $5 billion revolving credit facility and $7.3 billion of senior notes issued in fiscal 2020—to ensure coverage of operating expenditures, settlement obligations and strategic investments. Our investment portfolio is structured to meet working capital needs while earning returns, subject to ongoing review of market conditions and credit exposures, and we maintain a U.S. litigation escrow account under our retrospective responsibility plan to insulate shareholders from certain litigation liabilities. Contingent obligations for settlement guarantees and legal proceedings are regularly assessed and accrued when probable, pension and postretirement plan contributions are made in accordance with funding requirements and actuarial assumptions, and capital expenditures in technology and network infrastructure are maintained to support digital solutions and future growth, reflecting our multi-faceted approach to maintaining integrity and performance under internal and external pressures through adaptation, risk mitigation and strategic resource allocation.

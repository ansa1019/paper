Bank of America has built and continuously refines a comprehensive framework to preserve its functioning and performance under a wide range of challenging conditions by executing its business continuity plans and financial contingency and recovery plans, maintaining a global pool of readily available cash and high-quality unencumbered securities to ensure liquidity even under stress, and employing an enterprise response framework that invokes centralized crisis management, regular coordination by the CEO and the Executive Response Team of senior executives, and collaboration with global, regional and local authorities and health experts to protect employees, service clients and support communities during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The organization has implemented a work-from-home posture with pre-planned contingency strategies for site-based operations, loan modification programs exempt from troubled debt restructuring classification, and participation in relief initiatives such as the Paycheck Protection Program, all designed to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity.  We integrate risk management into daily operations and strategic planning through a clearly defined “identify-measure-monitor-control” process, a risk appetite statement approved annually by the Board and Enterprise Risk Committee, and robust governance over strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks.  Periodic stress forecasting and scenario analysis—covering parallel and non-parallel interest‐rate shocks, liquidity coverage and net stable funding requirements, capital adequacy under the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, counterparty credit stresses, and trading portfolio Value‐at‐Risk backtesting—enable the Corporation to assess potential impacts on capital, earnings and liquidity and to reconfigure strategies, including contingency funding options, contract amendments and asset reallocation, to emerge stronger from disruptive events.  Interest rate, foreign exchange and mortgage pipelines are hedged using derivatives designated as cash‐flow, fair‐value and net‐investment hedges to mitigate volatility in net interest income, accumulated other comprehensive income and mortgage servicing rights values.  Model risk is governed by an enterprise model risk policy with independent validation and ongoing outcomes analysis, and operational resilience is reinforced through policies, procedures and controls over technology, information security, cyber-risk prevention and response, legal and regulatory compliance, third-party dependencies and employee safety.  Contingency planning extends to resolution planning under the single-point-of-entry strategy, supported by NB Holdings’ liquidity arrangements, all reflecting the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions and the preservation of system integrity through adaptability, flexibility and strategic foresight.

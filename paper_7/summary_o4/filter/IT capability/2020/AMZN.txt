The Company’s MD&A describes the uncertainty inherent in forward-looking statements, noting that actual results may differ materially from management’s expectations due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, global economic conditions, customer spending, world events and other internal and external pressures. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions, the Company modified numerous aspects of its logistics, transportation, supply chain, purchasing and third-party seller processes, implemented process updates worldwide, adapted its fulfillment network, and deployed enhanced safety measures—including enhanced cleaning, physical distancing, personal protective equipment, disinfectant spraying and temperature checks—while hiring over 400,000 full- and part-time employees to increase fulfillment network capacity. The Company also prioritized employee and customer safety, incurring approximately $11.5 billion in COVID-19 related costs during 2020 and committing to continued compliance with evolving standards deemed in the best interests of stakeholders. To support its long-term, sustainable growth objectives and maintain operational flexibility during both nominal and extreme market conditions, the Company focuses on improving process efficiencies and maintaining a lean culture to manage variable and fixed costs, increasing direct sourcing, supplier discounts and reducing defects, optimizing inventory velocity to collect from consumers before payments to suppliers, and leveraging a cross-functional technology infrastructure that supports geographic expansion, AWS, fulfillment networks and customer-experience improvements. The Company regularly evaluates its capital resources and liquidity, believing that cash flows from operations, cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and borrowing arrangements will be sufficient to meet anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months, while acknowledging the substantial uncertainty of future cash requirements and credit-market availability. Management continues to invest in technology and content, including AWS, compute, storage, analytics and machine learning services, as well as innovative software and devices, with spending expected to increase over time in support of new products and service offerings, all of which underpin the Company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning in the face of adversity, adapt to environmental disruptions, and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

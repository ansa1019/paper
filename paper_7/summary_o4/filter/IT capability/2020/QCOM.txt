The rapid, global spread of COVID-19 has negatively impacted consumer demand for certain devices that incorporate our products and intellectual property, yet “the impact of COVID-19 on our ability to fulfill customer orders has been minimal” and “workforce changes that we implemented in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 remained in effect throughout fiscal 2020,” underscoring our operational flexibility and continuity under adverse conditions. In response to prior licensing disputes, we entered into long-term patent license and settlement agreements with Huawei, Apple, Oppo and Vivo—recording $1.8 billion and $4.7 billion in revenues not allocated to segment results—to preserve revenue streams and competitive positioning. QCT results benefited from a multi-year chipset supply agreement with Apple and a shift in product mix toward 5G and IoT products, while QTL results reflected accelerated royalty recognition under new revenue guidance, demonstrating our ability to adjust financial processes and resource allocation to maintain performance. We believe it is critical to remain a leader in 5G technology development, standardization, intellectual property creation and integrated circuit supply to sustain and grow our business long term, and accordingly increased R&D investments in wireless, 5G and application processor technologies even as we implemented cost-plan actions to reduce expenses. To ensure financial resilience, we maintain a strong liquidity position—“cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities” of $11.2 billion as of September 27, 2020—manage debt maturities through unsecured notes and a commercial paper program, and periodically evaluate our $30 billion share repurchase authorization to balance capital return with operational needs. We continually assess our investments for impairment—recording $405 million in non-marketable investment impairments in fiscal 2020—measure inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value in light of demand volatility, and monitor goodwill and long-lived assets for indicators of impairment. We record liabilities for legal and regulatory proceedings when losses are probable and regularly revise income tax provisions based on ongoing developments, reflecting our systematic approach to risk mitigation and adaptive financial management. Looking forward, while we expect continued negative demand impacts from the pandemic, intense competition, trade tensions and regulatory scrutiny, we currently do not anticipate material supply disruptions and believe our existing resources, strategic initiatives and process controls will enable us to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite ongoing adversity.

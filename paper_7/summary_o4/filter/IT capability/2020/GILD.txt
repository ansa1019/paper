In its 2020 MD&A, management highlights the company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity, noting that “our financial performance was strong in 2020, despite the global impact of the covid-19 pandemic,” which it attributes to solid underlying fundamentals and rapid reconfiguration of resource deployment across its HIV franchise and increased demand for Veklury. The company demonstrated operational flexibility and business continuity by entering into joint procurement agreements with the U.S. government and the European Union for Veklury distribution, hedging foreign currency exposure to mitigate external pressures, and maintaining working capital through disciplined cash flow management, debt repayment and refinancing activities. Strategic resilience is further evidenced by major acquisitions of Forty Seven, Inc. and Immunomedics, Inc., along with investments in oncology and antiviral R&D programs—including accelerated trials of remdesivir and magrolimab—illustrating a systemic perspective of resource generation, inter-organizational collaboration and innovation under turbulent market conditions. Management also reprioritized its R&D portfolio by pausing or postponing certain clinical trials because of the pandemic, reallocating human and financial resources to high-priority programs, and continually adjusting its capital allocation priorities to support future growth potential. Looking ahead to 2021, management projects a “gradual recovery in underlying market dynamics,” reflecting strategic foresight and the maintenance of performance and integrity under ongoing environmental perturbations.

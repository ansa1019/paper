In response to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, ADP prioritized the safety of its associates and the needs of its clients by implementing its business continuity plan in March 2020 and shifting over 98% of its workforce to work-from-home or off-site locations to ensure uninterrupted service, while gradually reintroducing a small, volunteer on-site workforce and maintaining primarily virtual client engagement with limited face-to-face meetings as conditions allowed. The company provided a one-time global associate assistance payment of $50.4 million, supported local relief efforts with financial and medical‐supply donations, and continued to process payroll and tax obligations despite unexpected challenges for its clients. ADP focused on delivering information and tools—including an employer preparedness toolkit, a dedicated PPP information website and over 1,000 product feature changes in response to 2,000 legislative updates across 60 countries—to help clients understand and navigate global relief measures, resulting in approximately 400,000 clients running over 2 million PPP reports. Despite disruptions to sales bookings and retention, ADP remained on its transformation journey, executing workforce optimization and procurement transformation initiatives in fiscal 2020 and launching a digital implementation and servicing initiative for fiscal 2021, leveraging real-time external and internal data to inform decisions and remain committed to its long-term strategy. The firm’s strong, low-capital-intensity, cash-generative business model generated sufficient free cash flow to support dividends, modest debt obligations, reinvestments and strategic initiatives, enabling it to absorb downturn impacts and preserve operational continuity. ADP maintained solid financial condition with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, access to $9.7 billion of committed credit facilities, and the ability to issue commercial paper or enter into reverse repurchase agreements, while its client funds investment strategy—emphasizing safety of principal, liquidity, diversification, maturity laddering and short-term financing—along with established credit quality, maturity and exposure limits and client fund impoundment practices, mitigated interest-rate, credit and foreign-currency risks and ensured sufficient liquidity to satisfy client obligations.

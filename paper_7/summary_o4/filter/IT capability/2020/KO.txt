Throughout 2020, the Company’s MD&A emphasized resilience as “emerging stronger” from the Covid-19 pandemic, with priorities of safeguarding the health and safety of employees, supporting communities, maintaining supply continuity and product quality, serving customers across all channels as demand shifted, and positioning the business to emerge stronger when the crisis ends. Global and regional teams monitored local markets and recommended risk mitigation actions, implemented travel restrictions, social distancing, temperature checks, enhanced facility cleaning and sanitization routines, and required most office-based employees to work remotely. Recognizing that business continuity and adaptability are critical in unexpected situations, the Company developed systemwide knowledge-sharing routines and supply chain management processes, reported no material impact on its and its bottling partners’ ability to manufacture or distribute products, and moved with speed to secure adequate inventory levels, prioritize core brands and consumer affordability, increase investments in e-commerce, tailor package sizes for online sales and shift consumer and trade promotions to digital. Leveraging the crisis as a catalyst, management accelerated its strategic trajectory by optimizing global, regional and local brand portfolios; establishing a disciplined innovation framework; strengthening data-driven revenue growth management and execution capabilities; enhancing system collaboration to capture supply chain efficiencies; and transforming its organizational structure through strategic realignment initiatives to build a networked global organization that combines the power of scale with deep local knowledge. Beyond pandemic response, the Company maintains formal risk management and continuity programs—such as a water stewardship strategic framework executed locally through water-use efficiency, wastewater treatment, shared watershed protection and community engagement; rigorous quality management with integrated risk identification, mitigation and continuous improvement across the supply chain; and prudent financial resilience via diversified debt financing, commercial paper facilities, supply chain finance and trade receivables factoring—designed to absorb strain, preserve integrity and sustain performance under evolving environmental, regulatory and market pressures.

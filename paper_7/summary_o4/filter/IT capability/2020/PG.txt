The company discloses its ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements (including execution of supply chain optimizations and sole‐supplier and sole‐manufacturing plant arrangements) and to manage disruption of business due to factors outside of its control, such as natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism or disease outbreaks, as a critical element of its risk mitigation and business continuity planning. In fiscal 2020, the company prioritized protecting the health and safety of employees; maximizing the availability of essential health, hygiene and cleaning products; and deploying its employees’ talents and resources to help society meet unprecedented challenges posed by the covid-19 pandemic, working closely with government authorities and health agencies to keep manufacturing facilities open and implementing safety measures in plants and distribution centers. Although the company broadly maintained operations, it experienced supply chain disruptions in certain enterprise markets due to restrictions on employee movements and elevated transportation and manufacturing costs, and it intends to continue collaborative efforts with authorities and safety initiatives to sustain manufacturing and distribution continuity. The MD&A highlights the company’s ability to manage cost fluctuations—including commodity inputs, transportation, labor and pension expenses—through pricing actions, targeted sourcing decisions and an ongoing multi-year productivity and cost savings program initiated in 2012 and expanded in 2017, which has streamlined management decision making, optimized supply chain, research and development, marketing and overhead processes and delivered approximately $3.7 billion in annual before-tax gross savings that are reinvested in product and package improvements, brand communication, retail execution and R&D. To support supplier financial stability and maintain working‐capital efficiency, the company negotiates extended payment terms and sponsors a supply chain finance program that allows qualifying suppliers to monetize receivables without impacting the company’s payment terms or days-payable-outstanding. To mitigate financial market volatility, the company employs derivative instruments—including forward contracts, currency and interest rate swaps and commodity hedges—within established policy limits. The company’s strong liquidity profile and financial resilience are underpinned by substantial operating cash flows, disciplined capital spending, robust credit ratings, diversified short- and long-term debt facilities and ongoing assessment of cash requirements and funding sources. An organizational redesign effective July 1, 2019 restructured the enterprise into sector business units with global profit responsibility and innovation and supply chain accountability, enterprise markets responsible for localized sales and execution, corporate functions overseeing strategy, governance and legal, and global business services providing technology, processes and data tools, thereby enhancing operational effectiveness, organizational flexibility and accountability across all levels of the business under dynamic global economic and regulatory conditions.

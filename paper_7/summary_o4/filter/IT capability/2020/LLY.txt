In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been focused on maintaining a reliable supply of our medicines; reducing the strain on the medical system; developing treatments for COVID-19; protecting the health, safety, and well-being of our employees; supporting our communities; and ensuring affordability of and access to our medicines, particularly insulin. At the beginning of the pandemic, we paused new clinical trial starts and enrollment in new trials in order to reduce the strain on the medical system, and we have resumed this activity in our clinical trials. For 2020, we were able to largely maintain our normal operations. However, uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse impact on our manufacturing operations, global supply chain, and distribution systems, which could impact our ability to produce and distribute our products and the ability of third parties on which we rely to fulfill their obligations to us, and could increase our expenses. Our ability to continue to operate without significant negative impacts will in part depend on our ability to protect our employees and our supply chain, and we have taken steps to protect our employees worldwide, with particular measures in place for those working in our manufacturing sites and distribution facilities. We believe our available cash and cash equivalents, together with our ability to generate operating cash flow and our access to short-term and long-term borrowings, are sufficient to fund our existing and planned capital requirements, and our management continuously evaluates our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can adequately and efficiently finance our capital requirements. The objective of our risk-management program is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates, and we seek to address a portion of these risks through a controlled program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We manage research and development spending across our portfolio of potential new medicines so that a delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending. We strategically invest in external research and technologies that we believe complement and strengthen our own efforts, and we view our business development activity as an important way to achieve our strategies, continuously evaluating transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business, bolster our pipeline, and enhance shareholder value.

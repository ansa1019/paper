During 2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic and associated external pressures, the Company continued to build on its technical, operational and financial foundation to drive its long-term growth strategy, delivering strong financial results—net revenue of $9.8 billion, a 45 percent increase year-over-year—and extending its industry-leading product portfolio through consistent execution of its product roadmap and launches of multiple leading-edge manufacturing technologies. To preserve business continuity and maintain performance under challenging conditions, the Company monitored demand signals and adjusted its supply chain requirements and product schedules to address changing customer needs and geographic and market demand shifts, supported most employees working from home while taking measures to protect health and safety and enable productivity, and maintained sufficient liquidity—$2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and a revolving credit facility—to fund operations and capital expenditures over at least the next twelve months and access capital markets if required. The Company also pursued strategic initiatives to strengthen its competitive position and resilience, including the announced acquisition of Xilinx, continued debt reduction and balance sheet improvement, proactive adjustments of its valuation allowances and critical accounting estimates based on internal and external data to mitigate financial reporting risks, and ongoing investments in research and development and go-to-market activities to ensure adaptability and resource reconfiguration in response to internal or external variations, thereby preserving or improving functioning in the face of adversity.

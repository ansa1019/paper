Starbucks’ fiscal 2020 results reflect the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, including temporary store closures, modified business operations and reduced customer traffic; however, the company gradually reopened stores, achieving sequential improvements in comparable store sales and transaction volumes, reflecting the resilience of its business model and the strength of its brand. To protect partner health and welfare, Starbucks incurred incremental labor costs—paying wages and benefits for partners unable or uncomfortable working, providing temporary wage increases to those continuing to work and additional benefits to furloughed or separated partners—while leveraging CARES Act and CEWS credits. In June 2020, Starbucks announced a North America store portfolio optimization plan, blending store formats to cater to changing customer preferences, and for international licensees extended flexible development and financial terms, including waiving royalty payments during the fiscal third quarter. Throughout the second half of fiscal 2020, nearly all company-operated and licensed stores were reopened under modified operations to meet public health guidelines and evolving customer behaviors, supporting steady business recovery in China and upward momentum in the U.S. Through continued investments in technologies and innovations—such as contactless customer experiences, digital capabilities, beverage innovation and reimagined store formats—Starbucks aims to adapt swiftly to new customer behaviors and drive long-term growth. The company actively manages cash and investments to fund operating needs, support store partners and invest in strategic initiatives, and anticipates that operating cash flows, existing liquidity and debt capacity will be sufficient to finance capital requirements, facilitate acquisitions and return cash to shareholders while maintaining financial flexibility absent significant COVID-19 relapses or global economic disruptions.

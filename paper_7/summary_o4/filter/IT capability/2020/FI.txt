The Company’s disclosures emphasize its ability to absorb disruptions and maintain performance under adverse conditions by implementing a suite of business continuity and operational flexibility measures, including segment realignment after the First Data acquisition to reconfigure management structure and portfolio holdings, ongoing portfolio reviews to acquire strategically aligned businesses and divest non-core assets, and the execution of post-merger integration plans to realize revenue and cost synergies through streamlined operations, economies of scale and enhanced efficiency. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company enacted pandemic-related safety and continuity protocols—mandating remote work, suspending non-essential travel, disinfecting facilities, providing personal protective equipment, expanding paid time-off and critical-infrastructure pay, and adapting policies per evolving guidance—while also managing discretionary costs by limiting hiring, third-party spending and employee benefit contributions, deferring capital expenditures, and continuously monitoring developments to mitigate operational and financial risks. The Company reports a partial recovery of merchant acquiring transaction and payment volumes beginning in May 2020, though it acknowledges ongoing uncertainty and difficulty in anticipating future results. It sustains adequate liquidity through cash reserves, revolving credit and term-loan facilities, senior notes and receivables securitization structures, and rigorously manages debt covenants, credit ratings, guarantee obligations and contingent liabilities, thereby preserving organizational resilience and systemic integrity. Regular assessments of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment further support risk mitigation, and the Company’s focus on technology modernization, digital channels, recurring revenue models, diverse client base and strategic partnerships underpins its capacity to adapt to environmental disruptions, maintain integrity and pursue growth in turbulent and uncertain market conditions.

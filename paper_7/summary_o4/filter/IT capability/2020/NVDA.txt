The company discloses that in response to volatile demand and supply-chain constraints it may build inventory for anticipated growth or pent-up demand, place non-cancellable orders well in advance, pay premiums or deposits to secure future capacity and components, and sell through a channel model whose partners’ decisions can affect its financial results. It notes that the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted unprecedented travel restrictions, business closures, remote work for most employees and quarantines, yet its gaming, data center and professional visualization platforms have benefited from work-from-home trends while supply-chain availability remains constrained, and that continued uncertainty in customer demand and logistical services may have a material net negative impact on its business and financial results. The company states its belief that existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with commercial paper, other short-term liquidity arrangements and a credit agreement permitting borrowings up to $575 million, will be sufficient to satisfy working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months, and that it continuously evaluates its liquidity and capital resources, including access to external capital, to ensure efficient financing of its requirements beyond twelve months. In connection with its pending Arm acquisition, the company has allocated the $2 billion signing payment between advanced consideration, intellectual property license prepayment and royalties, structured contingent earn-out provisions subject to financial performance targets, and engaged with regulators across multiple jurisdictions to manage closing conditions and mitigate transaction risk. In discussing demand forecasting and revenue recognition, the company acknowledges reliance on multiple assumptions—such as product transitions, competitor actions, fluctuating cryptocurrency market demand and pandemic-driven consumer behavior—any of which may prove incorrect and could materially affect its results.

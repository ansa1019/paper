In connection with the merger, management enhanced the spectrum portfolio, increased the customer base, altered the product mix, and created opportunities for synergies in operations, anticipating an initial increase in combined operating costs which it expects to decrease as synergies are realized. As a combined company, the business plans to enhance the breadth and depth of the nationwide 5G network, accelerate innovation, increase competition, and achieve significant cost reductions by eliminating redundancies within the combined network and other business processes and operations. Restructuring initiatives have been implemented to realize cost efficiencies, including contract terminations, store rationalizations, severance and network decommissioning, with additional initiatives under evaluation dependent on consultations with counterparties and the expected impact on operations. As a critical communications infrastructure provider, the company’s COVID-19 response focused on providing crucial connectivity while ensuring employee safety and community well-being, including supplementing pay, providing incremental paid time off, transitioning a significant portion of employees to remote work and enhancing sanitation protocols. The company committed to the FCC’s Keep Americans Connected pledge by not terminating service to residential or small business customers and waiving late fees, and continued to work with customers to maintain service and avoid financial hardship. It provided unlimited high-speed smartphone data, supplemental mobile hotspot allowances, free data to Lifeline and educational program participants, deployed additional temporary 600 MHz spectrum to double LTE capacity, and introduced virtual selling and curbside pickup solutions to help keep customers connected. The company continues to monitor pandemic impacts, adjust actions as needed, and reevaluate spending across marketing, capital projects, travel and third-party services given significant uncertainty. Liquidity is supported by cash generated from operations, issuances and repayments of long- and short-term debt, vendor financing arrangements, securitization transactions, sale of accounts receivable and financing lease facilities, and the $4.0 billion secured term loan and revolving credit facilities entered into at merger close, the subsequent $5.0 billion senior secured term loan commitment, and a $5.5 billion revolving credit amendment, with proceeds intended for general corporate purposes including capital expenditures, spectrum purchases, opportunistic investments and refinancing existing indebtedness. Management expects principal funding sources to be sufficient to meet liquidity requirements for the next 12 months and beyond, regularly reviews projections for changes in financial and operating results, economic conditions and the competitive landscape, and anticipates that capital expenditures will peak in 2021 and 2022 before declining.

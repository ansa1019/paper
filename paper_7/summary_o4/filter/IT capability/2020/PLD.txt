The companyâ€™s business continuity, communication plans and technology are allowing all functions of its business to work smoothly during this time, with employees continuing to work remotely or in offices under protocols to keep a safe working environment, no lay-offs and extended financial assistance to those in need, while local property and leasing teams have maintained our properties and worked with our customers to help them navigate the new environment in compliance with established safety measures. We experienced minimal impacts from the current environment on our O&M portfolio operating fundamentals in 2020 as a result of the high quality and location of our real estate portfolio, our customer base, favorable market fundamentals in the logistics real estate sector and significant in-place-to-market rent spreads, with negatively impacted customers representing a minimal percentage of our annual rent. E-commerce continues to grow well above its historical average and customers that serve essential daily needs are thriving. Leasing activity remained strong with the commencement of 150 million square feet of leases at an average term of 66 months, rent change of 21.3 % during 2020 and 23.8 % in the fourth quarter, a decrease in average days from lease proposal to commencement, and rent deferrals of $45 million (less than 1 % of our total annualized rental revenue) of which $33 million, or 98 %, was collected by January 25, 2021, without impacting revenue recognition. Although COVID-19 continues to have a minimal impact on rent collections and bad debt is trending lower than initially anticipated, we may experience an increase in bad debt. Our capital deployment and disposition activities have continued throughout this time and are expected to accelerate in 2021, with the majority of speculative development projects suspended in the first quarter restarted by the fourth quarter, while maintaining total available liquidity of $4.8 billion, extending weighted average remaining debt maturity to 10 years and lowering our weighted average effective interest rate to approximately 1.9 % through refinancing and issuance of sustainable green bonds. In addition, through our Space for Good program, the Prologis Foundation and direct cash grants, we provided over one million square feet of space, $5 million to COVID-19 relief organizations and $1 million in support of racial equality causes, collectively demonstrating our capacity to absorb strain, reconfigure resources and preserve functioning under challenging conditions.

The Company notes that “while we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items and through online offerings,” thereby absorbing competitive pressures and preserving performance. It further recognizes that “we also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses,” though “the negative aspects of such growth, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance” as part of its strategic expansion and resource reallocation. The membership format is described as integral to reinforcing loyalty and providing continuing fee revenue, contributing to business continuity and cash flow stability. In its response to COVID-19, the Company states that “our warehouses have largely remained open as a result of being deemed an ‘essential business’ in most markets,” resulting in strong core category sales and “improved gross margin and SG&A percentages as we leveraged these sales to achieve greater efficiency,” while also incurring “incremental wage and sanitation costs” and pivoting to increased e-commerce activity amid temporary closures of ancillary businesses. To mitigate risk and ensure organizational health, the Company maintains “bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes,” self-insurance through a captive insurance subsidiary and reinsurance program, and holds “cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments” believed sufficient “to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future.” Capital expenditure plans and warehouse openings are adjusted in the face of “delays in real estate and construction activities due to COVID-19,” reflecting operational flexibility and planning under uncertainty, and employee compensation policies targeting above-average wages and benefits aim at reducing turnover and enhancing workforce stability, all supporting the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

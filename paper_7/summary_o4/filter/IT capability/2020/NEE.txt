NEE and its subsidiaries—including FPL, NEER and Gulf Power—emphasize their ongoing monitoring and mitigation efforts in response to external shocks such as the global COVID-19 pandemic and extreme weather events. For example, “NEE and FPL are closely monitoring the global outbreak of COVID-19 and are taking steps intended to mitigate the potential risks to NEE and FPL posed by COVID-19,” and FPL’s service area was impacted by Hurricane Dorian in 2019 and by Hurricane Isaias and Tropical Storm Eta in 2020; FPL “determined that it would not seek recovery of the Hurricane Dorian, Hurricane Isaias and Tropical Storm Eta storm restoration costs through a storm surcharge from customers and instead recorded costs as storm restoration costs” and “used available reserve amortization to offset all such storm restoration costs,” while Gulf Power recorded estimated recoverable costs of approximately $206 million following Hurricane Sally in 2020. The company’s liquidity and capital resources discussion details a composite resilience strategy whereby “funds are primarily provided by cash flows from operations, borrowings or issuances of short- and long-term debt, proceeds from differential membership interests, sales of assets … and, from time to time, issuances of equity securities,” enabling “maintaining, on a long-term basis, a capital structure that will support a strong investment grade credit rating.” Management acknowledges that failure to maintain current credit ratings “could affect their ability to raise short- and long-term capital, their cost of capital and the execution of their respective financing strategies, and could require the posting of additional collateral,” prompting reliance on credit facilities, counterparty credit limits, letters of credit and guarantees. Risk management practices include the use of derivative instruments “primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards” to manage commodity price, interest rate and foreign currency exposure, coupled with established market risk policies, periodic updates to an Exposure Management Committee and a value-at-risk model, while counterparty credit risk is mitigated through master netting agreements and collateral arrangements. These processes and resource allocation decisions support the company’s ability to maintain service continuity, preserve operational flexibility and manage financial and regulatory pressures under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

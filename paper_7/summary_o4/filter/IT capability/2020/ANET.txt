In managing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has taken numerous steps to protect employees by closing offices globally, instructing employees to work from home and implementing travel restrictions, while continuing to work closely with contract manufacturers and supply chain partners experiencing delays by funding additional working capital and incremental purchase commitments and planning further investments in working capital as supply availability improves to address the risk of future pandemic-related supply chain disruptions. Although the pandemic initially caused volatility in customer demand, sales activity stabilized with incremental improvements as the year progressed, and the company has carefully reviewed investment and spending plans, cautiously increasing incremental spending as overall demand stabilized, while actively monitoring the evolving impact of COVID-19 on its financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry and workforce. The company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements and support growth strategies for at least the next 12 months, and plans to continue investing for long-term growth. The company’s future success is dependent upon its ability to evolve and adapt to a rapidly changing environment characterized by intensifying competition, rapidly changing technology, changing end-customer needs and evolving industry standards, by continuing to develop market-leading products and features, expanding its sales force and relationships with channel and system-level partners to reach new and existing customers more effectively, and investing in research and development to enhance its cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features and build upon its technology leadership. The development model focused on agnostic merchant silicon architecture enables the company to leverage investments by silicon vendors and to rapidly develop new features and applications, while strategic acquisitions of Big Switch Networks and Awake Security have expanded data center networking solutions, strengthened network monitoring and observability, and added autonomous network detection and response capabilities combining artificial intelligence with human expertise, thereby reinforcing the company’s ability to absorb strain, preserve performance under external pressures and respond effectively to technological disruptions.

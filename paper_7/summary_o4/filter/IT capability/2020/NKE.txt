Nike’s management has pursued a trajectory model of resilience that emphasizes maintaining performance under adversity by rapidly reconfiguring its operating model, resources and processes to meet evolving consumer needs and external disruptions. Since fiscal 2018, Nike has executed its Consumer Direct Offense and Triple Double strategy to double the impact of innovation, increase speed and agility to market and deepen direct‐to‐consumer connections, culminating in the June 2020 Consumer Direct Acceleration phase which realigns product creation around men’s, women’s and kids’ consumer constructs, simplifies the operating model to optimize effectiveness, and unifies investments in data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering, inventory management and end-to-end technology to unlock efficiency, drive responsiveness and accelerate digital transformation. In response to COVID‐19 travel restrictions, store closures, reduced operating hours and supply-chain disruptions, Nike modified buying plans, canceled certain pre-pandemic factory purchases, shifted product offer dates, reallocated inventory into digital channels, increased fulfillment capacity, and deployed targeted promotions and markdowns to liquidate excess stock while protecting the long-term health of its product franchises. To mitigate liquidity risk and preserve organizational continuity, Nike enhanced its liquidity position by issuing $6 billion of senior unsecured notes, temporarily suspending its share repurchase program and entering into a new $2 billion committed credit facility, while continuing to invest in infrastructure focused on digital capabilities, corporate facilities and supply-chain improvements. Throughout the pandemic, Nike’s digital commerce channel remained open and grew 79 percent on a currency‐neutral basis in the fourth quarter, and stores were systematically reopened in line with public health guidance, illustrating operational flexibility and rapid recovery mechanisms. The company continues to monitor the dynamic environment, adjust its operating plan as necessary and execute long‐term financial goals—high single‐digit revenue growth, slight expense leverage and low-thirties percent return on invested capital—despite short‐term adverse impacts. Portfolio and geographic operating model optimizations include transitioning Nike brand businesses in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay to third‐party distributors (with related assets classified as held-for-sale and a $405 million impairment recognized) and divesting Hurley, actions intended to preserve or improve profitability, reduce expense, reconfigure resource deployment and lessen foreign exchange exposure. Across all regions, Nike leverages strategic agility, supply-chain reconfiguration, risk‐management hedging programs and disciplined capital allocation to absorb strain, preserve integrity and emerge stronger from extreme conditions.

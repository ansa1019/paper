In response to severe disruptions from the COVID-19 global pandemic, including travel bans, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and widespread suspension of elective medical procedures that materially adversely affected our global suppliers, vendors, distributors and manufacturing facilities, Stryker implemented adaptive operational and financial measures to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adverse conditions. The response included unprecedented governmental and health authority measures which have had, and could continue to have, a significant negative impact on operations and financial results, but through operating expense savings actions, flexible working capital management, increased leverage under credit facilities, and the continuation of strategic capital allocation—investing $4,222 million in acquisitions (including Wright and Orthosensor), paying $863 million in dividends, and suspending share repurchases—Stryker maintained business continuity and progressive improvement in cash flows. Research, development and engineering projects to develop new products, investments in new technologies and integration of recent acquisitions were partially offset by targeted expense reductions, while selling, general and administrative expense actions included in-process asset impairments and suspension of certain investments due to pandemic-related constraints. Despite a 3.6% net sales decline and margin pressures from lower sales volumes and unfavorable product mix, operating income and adjusted net earnings were supported by continued focus on expense savings and risk mitigation strategies. Stryker’s ability to generate substantial cash from operations, supplement operating cash flow with debt, maintain $3,024 million in cash and marketable securities, secure committed revolving credit facilities, and uphold strong investment-grade debt ratings illustrates organizational resilience through effective resource reconfiguration, liquidity management, and systemic agility to maintain integrity and performance under challenging and exceptional conditions.

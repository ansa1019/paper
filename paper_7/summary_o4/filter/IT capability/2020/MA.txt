Mastercard continues to monitor the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and government actions, including travel restrictions, social-distancing measures and limitations on business operations, as well as the ongoing impacts on consumers, customers, suppliers, business partners and its workforce. Its payment solutions are designed to offer customers choice and flexibility while ensuring safety and security for the global payments system. The company relies on existing liquidity, cash generated from operations and access to capital—through a $6 billion commercial paper program and a $6 billion committed revolving credit facility—to fund global operations, credit and settlement exposures, capital expenditures, investments and commitments, and believes these resources are sufficient to satisfy future operating cash needs and other liquidity requirements, although they could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions or adverse legal or regulatory outcomes. Mastercard guarantees settlement of many customer transactions—where potential losses may be driven by regional or global economic conditions and the health of financial institutions—and assesses these guarantees in its settlement and other risk management processes. Adjusted operating expenses decreased 1 percent on a currency-neutral basis, including a 4 percentage point increase from acquisitions, while excluding acquisitions expenses declined 5 percent, primarily due to reduced spending on advertising and marketing, travel and professional fees, partially offset by higher personnel and data processing costs to support continued investment in strategic initiatives. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $1.0 billion in 2020 versus the prior year, primarily due to lower net income adjusted for non-cash items, partially offset by decreased litigation payments. To manage transactional currency exposure, the company enters into foreign exchange derivative contracts—formally designating certain contracts as cash flow hedges effective January 2021—deferring related gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income and excluding them from currency-neutral growth rates. Business agreements with certain customers include volume- and performance-based rebates or support incentives, which are recorded as reductions to gross revenue based on estimates of customer performance and adjusted when actual results are reported. Mastercard regularly reviews the status of significant claims and legal proceedings, assesses potential financial exposures and, when a loss is considered probable and estimable, accrues a liability subject to ongoing reassessment as new information becomes available. During 2020, the company completed $1.1 billion of acquisitions, repurchased $4.5 billion of its common stock and issued $4.0 billion of debt, reflecting strategic resource deployment to maintain performance under challenging conditions.

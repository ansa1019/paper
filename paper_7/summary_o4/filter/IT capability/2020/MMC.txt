In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company implemented travel restrictions, work-from-home capabilities and flexible work policies, reopened offices in line with evolving government guidelines and expects to continue servicing clients effectively in a remote work environment, thereby maintaining business continuity under challenging conditions. Disciplined expense management—most notably restrictions on travel and other cost containment measures—helped mitigate the pandemic’s adverse impact on revenue growth and preserve operational flexibility. The risk and insurance services segment leverages risk management activities, risk transfer and mitigation solutions alongside proprietary analytics to absorb strain from environmental perturbations, while the consulting segment employs technology-driven advice and health, wealth and career solutions to support client organizations facing external pressures. Following the April 2019 acquisition of Jardine Lloyd Thompson, the company reconfigured its operations through severance, real estate rationalization, technology investments and process integration, exceeding the initial estimated savings and realizing approximately $425 million of annualized savings by streamlining resource allocation and preserving performance. To ensure liquidity and adaptability, the company maintains multi-currency revolving credit and term-loan facilities, a commercial paper program and regularly repatriates non-U.S. earnings, balancing permanent reinvestment with U.S. capital requirements. Its pension funding strategy applies actuarial analyses, target asset allocations and negotiated funding agreements for U.S. and U.K. plans, adapting to discount rate fluctuations and market volatility to sustain pension integrity. Through these measures—encompassing strategic cost containment, risk mitigation, resource reconfiguration and robust liquidity management—the company demonstrates the capacity to absorb strain, preserve functioning and adapt dynamically to both internal and external disturbances.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic’s severe external variations and disturbances, we have raised $4.1 billion in debt and amended our revolving credit facility to provide additional financial flexibility; undertaken restructuring activities across all brands, resulting in a 23 percent headcount reduction and expected annualized cost savings of approximately $370 million in personnel-related expenses; implemented a company-wide hiring freeze; eliminated non-essential business travel; canceled internal events; significantly reduced marketing spend; sold investments in government and corporate debt securities and trip.com Group ADSs; and participated in government wage-support programs, all designed to preserve business continuity and safeguard financial resources. We have committed to allow cancellations of certain non-refundable bookings and waived fees for restaurant partners, reinforcing our ability to absorb strain and maintain functioning despite adversity. To reinforce systemic integrity and competitive advantage, we have increased collaboration among our brands by sharing resources and technological innovations, co-developing new services and coordinating market activities, while dynamically reallocating resources between agency and merchant transaction models and employing derivative instruments to mitigate foreign exchange risk. We continue to innovate our online platforms, enhance payment processing capabilities and monitor partner health to support operational flexibility, risk mitigation and recovery. Our liquidity management actions—including new debt issuances, reduced capital expenditures and vigilant monitoring of third-party relationships—are expected to sustain our operations through at least the next twelve months. These measures reflect our organizational resilience strategy, focused on maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions and positioning the Company to emerge stronger as industry demand recovers.

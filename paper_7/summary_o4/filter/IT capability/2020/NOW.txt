In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has continuously monitored actual and potential effects across its operations, focused on maintaining business continuity by temporarily closing offices and transitioning employees to remote work, canceling in-person user conferences and replacing them with digital event experiences, and releasing emergency response and Safe Workplace applications designed to help customers manage returning employees safely and support health and safety protocols. These operational changes have not affected—and are not expected to affect—the company’s ability to maintain its operations, including financial reporting systems, internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Leveraging a subscription-based business model with relatively predictable revenues, a strong balance of cash, cash equivalents and investments, and access to capital markets through debt issuances and hedging strategies to mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risks, the company has sought to preserve its integrity and performance under significant external perturbations. The firm continues to invest in development of its services, infrastructure, sales and marketing, digital transformation across functions and its professional services organization—focused on strategic advisory, implementation and consulting—to accelerate platform adoption, drive customer outcomes and build long-term growth, while maintaining sufficient liquidity and operational flexibility to meet debt service, capital expenditure and working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months under uncertain conditions.

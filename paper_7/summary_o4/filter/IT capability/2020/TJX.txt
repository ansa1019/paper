TJX has undertaken a series of operational and strategic adaptations to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the adversity of the COVID-19 pandemic and related disruptions. During March 2020, the company temporarily closed all of its stores, online businesses, distribution centers and offices—shifting associates to remote work where possible and furloughing the majority of hourly store and distribution center associates while maintaining employee benefits coverage—and took comparable actions across its European and Australian workforces. To reconstitute operations, TJX implemented new health and safety practices including personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning regimens, social distancing protocols with occupancy limits, protective shields at registers, signage and queue markers, and revised merchandise-handling processes, and established several global task force teams charged with navigating the crisis. It introduced a new performance metric, “open-only comp store sales,” to track sales of stores as they reopened on days they were open compared to the same days in the prior year. In response to Brexit and other external pressures, it realigned its European supply chain to reduce merchandise flow between the U.K. and the EU and established resources and systems to support this plan. Financial resilience measures included negotiating rent deferrals with corresponding lease liability remeasurements, extending payment terms on merchandise orders to enhance operating cash flows, entering into a $500 million 364-day revolving credit facility (bringing total availability to $1.5 billion), issuing and refinancing notes to optimize debt maturities and interest costs, and routinely employing inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate foreign-currency risk on merchandise purchases. The company evaluated inventory values in light of temporary closures, recording markdowns, write-offs of perishable goods and impairment charges for lease right-of-use assets and store fixed assets when triggering events were deemed to have occurred. It incurred incremental store and distribution payroll costs to implement and maintain health and safety protocols, provided discretionary appreciation bonuses, and qualified for government programs that partially offset related expenses. To preserve liquidity and flexibility, TJX implemented cost-saving initiatives to reduce ongoing variable and discretionary spending, suspended its share repurchase program, and plans to be prudent with expenses in fiscal 2022 while investing $1.2–$1.4 billion in capital expenditures—including incremental investments in infrastructure and distribution centers—and opening approximately 120 net new stores. The company believes its cash and cash equivalents of $10.5 billion, internally generated funds and credit facilities are adequate to meet its operating needs over the next fiscal year.

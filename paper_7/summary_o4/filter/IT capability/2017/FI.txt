The Company actively manages its business portfolio by frequently reviewing acquisitions and dispositions to ensure it has the right set of businesses to execute its strategy, acquiring businesses when they present a compelling strategic need, an opportunity to change industry dynamics or achieve scale, and divesting those not aligned with its market, product or financial objectives. Our strategic initiatives consist of active portfolio management, enhancement of client relationships, improvement of operational effectiveness, disciplined allocation of capital, and differentiation of products and services through innovation, all of which support business continuity and operational flexibility under challenging conditions. The majority of our revenue derives from recurring account- and transaction-based fees under contracts with three-to-five-year terms and high renewal rates, providing non-discretionary, stable revenue streams that preserve functioning despite evolving market and regulatory pressures. In response to a rapidly evolving financial services environment marked by new entrants, regulatory reforms and cybersecurity scrutiny, we continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information, maintain compliance and offer innovative services, anticipating that outsourcing trends and economies of scale in infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks will enhance our ability to adapt and emerge stronger. We believe our sizable and diverse client base, together with our position as a leading provider of recurring revenue-based solutions, gives us a solid foundation for growth and resilience under external disturbances. Our products and services are designed to assist financial institutions in meeting regulatory and market challenges by generating incremental revenue and reducing costs. To maintain system integrity and financial resilience, we satisfy our primary liquidity needs—funding normal operations, servicing debt and supporting capital expenditures—through operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents of $325 million and available borrowings under a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility and a $540 million term loan, both bearing variable rates and subject to covenants limiting consolidated indebtedness to 3.5 times EBITDA and requiring a minimum EBITDA-to-interest expense ratio of three.

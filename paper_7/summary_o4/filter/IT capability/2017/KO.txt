In management’s discussion and analysis, the Company outlines its approach to maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions through continuous assessment and mitigation of water-related risks via a formal water risk management program—incorporating water use efficiency, wastewater treatment, shared watershed protection, community engagement, and stewardship of agricultural supply chains—to ensure resource availability and operational continuity. The Company collaborates with bottling partners to identify scalable processes and share best practices across its global distribution network, leveraging its brands, financial strength, distribution system and global reach to reconfigure resources, achieve efficiencies and enhance competitive advantage. Through structured productivity and reinvestment programs—with zero-based work, supply chain restructuring, operating model simplification and disciplined marketing investments—the Company generates incremental savings and funds consumer-facing innovation designed to sustain performance and accelerate growth. Refranchising and integration activities, including the consolidation or deconsolidation of bottling entities and the establishment of equity method investments, are presented as mechanisms to adapt the system architecture, reallocate capital and preserve asset integrity under evolving market conditions. The discussion further details the Company’s diversified funding strategy—comprising cash flows from operations, commercial paper, short- and long-term debt management and hedging programs—to fortify financial resilience against currency fluctuations, commodity price variability and hyperinflationary environments. Risk mitigation efforts extend to governance practices, integrated quality management in product safety, strategic partnerships addressing obesity, consumer preferences, regulatory pressures, food security and environmental sustainability, and proactive engagement in policy reform, all reinforcing the Company’s capacity to absorb strain, reconstitute trajectories and maintain functionality amid external disturbances and uncertainties.

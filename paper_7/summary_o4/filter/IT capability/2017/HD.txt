In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, three hurricanes impacted our operations in the continental U.S., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands and hurricane-related sales contributed approximately $662 million to net sales in the second half of fiscal 2017, albeit at a gross profit considerably less than the company average, and we incurred approximately $170 million of hurricane-related expenses; we generated $12.0 billion of cash flow from operations during fiscal 2017, which, together with $3.0 billion of long-term debt and $850 million of net short-term borrowings, was used to repay $500 million of floating rate senior notes, fund $8.0 billion for share repurchases, pay $4.2 billion of cash dividends, fund $1.9 billion in capital expenditures, and complete strategic acquisitions; we believe our current cash position, access to capital markets and cash flow from operations should be sufficient not only for operating requirements but also to enable completion of capital expenditure programs and funding of dividends, share repurchases and debt payments through the next several fiscal years, supported by our expanded commercial paper programs and back-up credit facilities of up to $3.0 billion, including a new five-year $2.0 billion credit facility expiring December 2022 and a 364-day $1.0 billion facility expiring December 2018; we use derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies and interest rates and employ capital and operating leases to finance real estate assets; we evaluate long-lived assets quarterly for impairment by comparing undiscounted future cash flows to carrying values, measuring fair value when impairment indicators arise; we maintain self-insurance liabilities for general liability, workersâ€™ compensation, employee medical and automobile claims based on historical data and actuarial estimates reviewed regularly by management and third-party actuaries; cash flow from operations provides significant liquidity, while working capital remains subject to variables such as seasonality, inventory management, vendor payment terms and foreign exchange fluctuations; and we value inventories under the retail inventory method at the lower of cost or market, with adjustments based on prevailing market conditions.

We believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to changes in economic health and competitive dynamics through adjustments to pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private label items, and by maintaining what we perceive as “pricing authority”—consistently providing the most competitive values and selectively reducing or holding prices despite cost increases, thereby demonstrating operational flexibility, risk mitigation and resource reallocation under pressure. Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian and other international segments, and we achieve continuity and scalability through new warehouse openings—accepting initial lower profitability and potential cannibalization that diminish over time—and through e-commerce growth, reflecting a systemic perspective on business continuity and transformation. Investments in employee compensation above industry averages to reduce turnover and enhance satisfaction, our predominantly self-insured approach to catastrophic and liability risks via a captive insurance subsidiary and reinsurance program, and our management of foreign-exchange and gasoline-price volatility through leveraging SG&A efficiencies and deferred revenue practices illustrate dynamic capabilities, strategic foresight and absorptive capacity to preserve organizational health and performance under nominal, fluctuating or challenging conditions. Management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows, supported by bank credit facilities that we intend to renew, deferred repatriation of non-U.S. earnings deemed indefinitely reinvested, and disciplined capital expenditure planning for warehouses and information-systems modernization, will be sufficient to meet liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future, thereby maintaining the integrity of our operations. Finally, our annual evaluation of long-lived assets for impairment—triggered by relocations, closures or changes in market or operational conditions—and our judicious approach to financing activities, including senior notes repayment, stock repurchases and dividend policies, evidence a multifaceted resilience strategy designed to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning and emerge stronger from internal or external disturbances.

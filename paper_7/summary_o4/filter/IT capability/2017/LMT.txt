Lockheed Martin discloses that it operates in an environment of increasing complexity and economic pressures, deploying a disciplined portfolio-shaping strategy—through selective acquisitions, divestitures, research and development, and reinvestment in workforce technical skills—to maintain the predictability and quality of program execution, adapt to resource constraints and absorb strain while preserving or improving functioning. Management emphasizes a balanced cash deployment and capital-structure strategy, including diversified financing through revolving credit facilities, commercial paper backed by committed banks, long-term notes and hedging programs to ensure liquidity, support operational continuity, fund unexpected contingencies and capitalize on new opportunities, thereby enhancing its ability to maintain system integrity under internal or external disturbances. Under its contract accounting practices, Lockheed Martin identifies and monitors technical, schedule and cost risks on long-term fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts, regularly revises total cost and profit estimates, recognizes provisions for anticipated losses and establishes reserves for performance matters to preserve financial integrity and firm performance. The Company also engages in non-recourse sales of receivables, advanced funding of customer programs pending government appropriations, and comprehensive performance reporting to manage operational resources and sustain service delivery under adverse conditions. It conducts quarterly evaluations of environmental remediation sites, records actuarially estimated liabilities and corresponding receivables recoverable in contract pricing, and adjusts for evolving regulatory standards to mitigate environmental hazards and avoid systemic failures. Postretirement benefit plans are managed through periodic actuarial remeasurements, assumption recalibrations and coordinated funding to optimize obligations and minimize material cash requirements, further preserving organizational health. The adoption of new revenue-recognition standards and goodwill impairment simplifications reflects ongoing refinement of internal controls and financial reporting processes to reduce brittleness. Foreign currency and interest-rate exposures are mitigated through designated cash-flow and fair-value hedges, and counterparty credit risk is actively managed. These measures collectively contribute to the organization’s capacity to foresee, confront and benefit from sudden disruptive change, maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions and supporting its mission-critical resilience.

We describe the maintenance of business continuity and preservation of company performance under a spectrum of internal and external pressures, noting that during 2017 and 2016 certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold operated in “challenging environments,” experiencing unstable economic, political and social conditions, civil unrest, natural disasters, debt and currency fluctuations, while the hurricanes and earthquakes in North and Central America did not materially impact our consolidated results. We emphasize our ongoing monitoring of macroeconomic, operating and political landscapes—including existing and proposed taxes, retail landscape disruption, shifting consumer preferences, e-commerce growth and niche brand emergence—and our identification and implementation of actions to mitigate potential unfavorable impacts on our future results. To support resilience, we leverage an enterprise-wide integrated risk management framework, overseen by the Board of Directors and its committees, supported by the PepsiCo Risk Committee, division and country risk committees, a centralized Risk Management Office, our Corporate Audit Department and Compliance & Ethics, to identify, assess, prioritize, manage, monitor and communicate strategic, financial, operating, compliance, safety, reputational and other risks. We hedge commodity price and foreign exchange exposures with swaps, futures and forward contracts, centrally managing derivatives to absorb volatility in agricultural, energy and metals costs and to offset currency translation effects, and we employ debt instruments as net investment hedges. We coordinate global purchasing programs, fixed-price contracts, pricing agreements and productivity initiatives—including multi-year plans that accelerate manufacturing automation, optimize footprint, expand shared services and simplify organization structures—to strengthen cost structures, operational flexibility and supply-chain continuity. We maintain strong liquidity through cash generated from operations, committed revolving credit facilities, commercial paper access and long-term debt, while managing working capital seasonality and considering capital transactions—acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, dividends, share repurchases and capital spending—to enhance shareholder value and secure our financial condition under both nominal and exceptional conditions. We also address the impacts of significant tax and regulatory changes, recognizing provisional net tax expense and remeasuring deferred tax balances under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act while evaluating the repatriation of offshore cash and planning for transition tax payments over the next eight years. Our control environment and sustained performance are supported by robust internal control and disclosure procedures, periodic independent and internal audits, and our global Code of Conduct, all designed to preserve organizational integrity, mitigate risk and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

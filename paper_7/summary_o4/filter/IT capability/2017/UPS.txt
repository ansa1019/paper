Management reported that 2017 consolidated revenue growth across all operating segments was supported by shipment growth, yield expansion and benefits from network investments and portfolio initiatives, even as natural disasters, fourth-quarter volume surges and the costs of facility construction and expanded Saturday operations imposed significant pressures on its domestic package network. To preserve organizational functioning and maintain performance under these internal and external disturbances, the company deploys adjusted non-GAAP measures that exclude mark-to-market pension charges and currency fluctuations, employs activity-based costing for business unit resource allocation, and evaluates its international and domestic businesses on a currency-neutral basis as part of its systemic performance assessment. UPS continually reconfigures its integrated air and ground network—through capacity expansion, facility automation, the expanded Saturday ground service covering approximately 50 percent of the U.S. population, and the deployment of Orion route-optimization technology—to adapt to volume variability, contain costs and increase package-sorting and delivery productivity. Risk mitigation mechanisms include dynamic fuel surcharge indexing tied to prevailing jet and diesel prices, currency and interest-rate hedging programs, and actuarially informed discretionary funding of pension and postretirement benefit plans. Strategic capabilities are further enhanced by acquisitions of Marken and Coyote to broaden its service innovation and logistics resilience, while firm commitments for new aircraft, vehicles, real estate and information-technology investments support future orientation and infrastructure integrity. The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and related provisional accounting for the transition tax and deferred tax remeasurement demonstrate organizational foresight, positioning lower future tax rates to finance strategic initiatives. Through disciplined capital-structure optimization, strong operating cash flow, access to commercial paper and alternative financing, and continuous reevaluation of contractual commitments, contingent liabilities and critical accounting estimates, UPS reinforces its ability to absorb strain, preserve operational continuity and positively adjust under challenging conditions.

Blackstone’s disclosures recognize that its businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in the U.S., Europe, Asia and elsewhere, exposing the firm to external pressures, environmental perturbations and the risk that difficult market conditions can reduce its ability to raise or deploy capital and impair firm performance. To address these challenges and preserve operational continuity, the firm maintains a globally integrated business across private equity, real estate, hedge fund solutions and credit segments, leveraging scale, proprietary information advantages and intellectual capital to allocate resources effectively, optimize its approach in the face of ever‐changing market conditions and actively manage assets through targeted transactions, growth equity investments, opportunistic platforms and active asset management. In response to evolving liquidity needs, Blackstone employs multiple sources of liquidity—including cash generated from operating activities, carried interest and incentive income realizations, realizations on carry and hedge fund investments, debt offerings and an unsecured revolving credit facility—and strategically uses debt issuances, note repurchases and equity repurchase authorizations to enhance financial flexibility and deconsolidate risk. The acquisition of GSO and Harvest and the concurrent ramp‐up of an internal, integrated platform for direct lending underscore the firm’s systemic perspective on reconstituting business trajectories, inter‐organizational collaboration and service innovation to ensure a smooth transition and sustained business continuity. Rigorous risk management processes, including ongoing monitoring of market volatility, interest rate shifts, geopolitical developments such as Brexit, BEPS proposals and U.S. tax reform impacts, support the firm’s ability to foresee, confront and benefit from sudden disruptive change, adapt to adverse conditions and preserve or improve functioning. Blackstone’s use of key operating metrics—assets under management, fee‐earning assets, distributable earnings, fee‐related earnings and segment economic income—provides transparent measures for performance assessment, resource deployment and strategic decision‐making, reflecting a multifaceted approach to maintaining integrity, resilience and competitive advantage under challenging conditions.

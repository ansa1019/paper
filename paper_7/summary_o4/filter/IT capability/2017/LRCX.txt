Our management’s discussion and analysis underscores our ongoing risk assessment and mitigation processes, noting that forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in conditions that could materially affect anticipated results, which we monitor through critical accounting policies and estimates covering revenue recognition, inventory valuation, warranty provisions, equity-based compensation and long-lived asset impairment testing. We continue to make significant investments in research and development—across sustaining engineering, product and process development, concept feasibility and increased employee headcount—and leverage cycles of learning from our broad installed base and collaborative partnerships with ecosystem participants, thereby enhancing our absorptive capacity, knowledge creation and inter-organizational collaboration to support adaptability, innovation and business continuity under evolving technology inflections such as NVM, multiple patterning, FinFET and advanced packaging. Our core technical competency in integrating hardware, process, materials, software and process control enables us to preserve productivity and cost-effectiveness under challenging conditions and maintain system integrity despite external perturbations driven by demand shifts from cloud, IoT and traditional two-dimensional scaling limitations. The increase in our backlog and market share, and our sustained levels of investment in capacity and technology, demonstrate our operational flexibility and resource reconfiguration capabilities in response to sudden disruptive change. Liquidity management remains central to our resilience strategy, with $6.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments, $2.0 billion of net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017, undrawn capacity under a $750 million revolving credit facility and anticipated cash flows expected to support operations, investments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures and dividends through at least the next 12 months, while recognizing that global economic and semiconductor industry uncertainty, as well as credit market disruptions, may impact customer demand and funding availability.

In management’s discussion and analysis, the company emphasizes its organizational resilience as demonstrated through the maintenance of operational integrity and performance under internal and external pressures such as derailments, personal injury incidents and network disruptions from events like Hurricane Harvey, by deploying safety and continuous improvement programs (including Courage to Care and Total Safety Culture), implementing Positive Train Control and realigning resources to sustain network fluidity and surge capability. It highlights adaptability and flexibility in combining core pricing, volume growth, productivity gains and strategic workforce adjustments to deliver record adjusted operating ratios and free cash flow, which support business continuity and recovery from adverse events. The 2018 capital plan of approximately $3.3 billion prioritizes renewal of existing infrastructure, expansion of terminal capacity, technology investments and acquisition of new locomotives and equipment to enhance long-term resilience and service innovation. Financial resilience is further reinforced by diversified liquidity channels—cash generated from operations, a receivables securitization facility, a revolving credit facility, and commercial paper programs—and proactive allocation of tax reform benefits toward reinvestment and shareholder returns. Risk mitigation and resource reconfiguration are evident in the use of actuarial analyses for personal injury, environmental and asbestos liabilities, pension and postretirement obligations, as well as in the governance of capital and debt-to-capital ratios to manage leverage. Labor agreement negotiations under the Railway Labor Act reflect strategic foresight to prevent operational disruptions, while climate-related strategies and fuel efficiency programs illustrate a systemic perspective aimed at sustaining performance under evolving environmental and market turbulences. Finally, non-GAAP performance measures such as adjusted ROIC and adjusted debt-to-capital ratios provide transparent benchmarks for assessing long-term value creation, organizational coherence and the firm’s capacity to reconstitute and adapt trajectories in response to disruptive change.

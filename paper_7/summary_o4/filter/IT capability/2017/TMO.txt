The Company’s management discussion describes a strategic framework of internal and external resource reconfiguration—through targeted acquisitions and development of proprietary technologies across its four business segments—to absorb external pressures and preserve or enhance operational performance. Strategic growth investments in commercial capabilities, geographic expansion, e-commerce platforms and focused research, together with productivity improvements driven by its practical process improvement system, global sourcing initiatives and facility consolidations, demonstrate efforts to mitigate cost constraints and sustain performance under inflationary and market challenges. Liquidity and business continuity are underpinned by $1.34 billion of cash, $4.01 billion of operating cash flow in 2017, and a $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility—maintained at an undrawn level equivalent to outstanding commercial paper—to ensure access to funds in the event of market disruptions. Tax planning initiatives for non-U.S. subsidiaries, which yielded foreign tax credits and minimized repatriation costs, reflect the reconfiguration of financial resources to support ongoing operations. Restructuring actions—including severance and abandoned facility costs to achieve acquisition synergies—streamline the organization and enhance its ability to adapt and maintain functioning. Finally, the Company’s systematic assessment of critical accounting estimates, accruals for litigation, environmental and other contingencies, unconditional purchase obligations and guarantees evidences a comprehensive approach to risk assessment and mitigation, preserving system integrity and enabling positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

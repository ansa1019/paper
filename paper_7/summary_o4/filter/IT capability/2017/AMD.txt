In 2017, we demonstrated robust adaptability and performance maintenance by launching more than 40 new high-performance CPUs and GPUs, reshaping our product portfolio and improving our technology competitiveness and by investing strategically in data center and other high performance products across our computing and graphics and enterprise, embedded and semi-custom segments. To mitigate supply chain risks and enhance operational flexibility under environmental perturbations, we entered into a sixth amendment to our wafer supply agreement establishing a comprehensive framework for 7nm technology collaboration, securing a limited waiver to contract with alternative foundries and agreeing wafer purchase targets to preserve production continuity. We amended our secured revolving line of credit to extend the maturity to March 2022, reduce margins and commitment fees, adjust borrowing base requirements and letters of credit availability, reinforcing our liquidity and financial resilience to fund operations, working capital and capital expenditures over the next twelve months. Throughout 2015 to 2017, we executed restructuring plans that included global headcount reductions, outsourcing IT services and exiting the dense server systems business to simplify our organization, optimize resource allocation and align our operations with strategic priorities. We monetized assets and established collaborative networks by divesting 85% of our equity interests in ATMP facilities, forming an ATMP joint venture and licensing IP to the THATIC joint venture, recognizing pre-tax gains and leveraging external resources to preserve functioning and facilitate future product development. We adapted our accounting for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 by recognizing provisional tax impacts under SAB 118 and evaluating GILTI accounting methods, demonstrating responsiveness to legislative changes. In managing product mix shifts, inventory write-downs and technology node transition charges, we applied risk assessment and corrective measures to maintain gross margin performance under challenging conditions. We believe our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance along with our secured revolving line of credit is sufficient to fund operations and sustain organizational health in the face of market volatility and uncertainty.

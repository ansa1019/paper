Danaher’s MD&A emphasizes that as “a diversified, global business,” its geographic and industry diversity, together with the breadth of its products, software and services, “help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results,” and that its individual businesses “monitor general economic trends” and “key competitors and customers…to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future.” The discussion identifies external pressures—rapid technological development, global labour costs, consolidation of competitors and increasing regulation—and states that long-term growth and profitability depend on the ability to “identify, consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions,” to “develop innovative and differentiated new products and services,” to expand and improve its sales force, to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality, and to address an increasingly regulated global environment. To support these objectives, the company is “making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources…to be responsive to the company’s customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the company’s operations,” while attributing “incremental year-over-year cost savings” to the “continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2017 and 2016” under the Danaher Business System. The MD&A further describes a non-GAAP core sales measure that excludes the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and currency translation to reveal underlying growth trends, reflecting management’s systemic perspective and future orientation. Finally, disclosures regarding liquidity and capital resources affirm that strong operating cash flows and a $4.0 billion credit facility underpin the company’s ability to fund working capital, strategic acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases, and detailed discussions of interest rate and currency exchange rate risk management underscore Danaher’s risk mitigation and resilience strategies in a volatile business environment.

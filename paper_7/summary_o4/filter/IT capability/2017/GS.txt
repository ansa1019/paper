In our annual Form 10-K we describe a series of measures and processes designed to enable the firm to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity: we emphasize the objectives and effectiveness of our business continuity plan, information security program, risk management and liquidity policies and our resolution plan and resolution strategy, including the design and effectiveness of our resolution capital and liquidity models and our triggers and alerts framework, to ensure continuity and positive adjustment under both nominal and stressed conditions; we seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid balance sheet through rigorous balance sheet planning, limit governance and asset-liability management that pre-funds potential cash and collateral needs via our global core liquid assets of highly liquid unencumbered securities and cash, supplemented by a detailed contingency funding plan that identifies drivers of potential outflows, key metrics, mitigating actions and escalation protocols; our enterprise risk management framework integrates market, credit, operational and model risk management by employing value-at-risk, sensitivity analyses, stress tests (including CCAR and DFAST), scenario analyses and defined limits and thresholds to assess and mitigate exposures arising from market volatility, credit events, operational failures or systemic disruptions; and we conduct comprehensive capital planning and stress testing, strategic growth initiatives (including targeted investments in technology and talent), inter-affiliate funding arrangements and recovery and resolution planning to project capital and liquidity trajectories, evaluate capital adequacy under severe stress and guide adaptive responses that support the firmâ€™s systemic integrity, flexibility and resilience.

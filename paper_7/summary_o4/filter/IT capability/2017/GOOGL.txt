Managementâ€™s discussion and analysis describes how we expand and evolve our product offerings to serve changing user behaviors and shifts from offline to online, seek to stay in front of market transitions to maintain and grow our business, and develop localized versions of our products and relevant advertising programs for users in emerging markets, actions that support business continuity amidst environmental perturbations. We have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations and use constant currency metrics for financial and operational decision-making to mitigate risk and maintain system integrity. We periodically review, refine and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and for identifying the revenues generated by click activity, reconfiguring processes in response to evolving ad formats, device mix, and policy changes, reflecting internal knowledge absorption and operational flexibility. Our continued significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus such as advertising, cloud, machine learning, and search, as well as acquisitions that enhance the breadth and depth of our offerings, demonstrate resource allocation and innovation to reconstitute trajectories toward the future. We recognize that our employees are among our best assets, and we continue to invest in them through hiring, competitive compensation programs, and facilities worldwide, strengthening organizational capabilities and social capital. We maintain sufficient sources of funding through cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, commercial paper, and a revolving credit facility to satisfy anticipated capital expenditures, working capital, potential acquisitions, and other liquidity requirements through at least the next twelve months, thereby supporting operational continuity. We routinely assess and adjust our reserves and critical accounting estimates, allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to tangible and intangible assets, test goodwill for impairment, and review marketable securities for other-than-temporary impairments, all as part of our risk mitigation and adaptation strategies to uphold performance under internal or external variations and disturbances.

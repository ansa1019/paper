In its Management’s Discussion and Analysis, the firm acknowledges that “global and regional economic conditions have a substantial impact on our financial condition and results of operations, impacting the values of the investments we make, our ability to exit these investments profitably, our ability to raise capital from investors and our ability to make new investments,” and it notes that “periods of volatility and dislocation in the capital markets present substantial risks, but also can present us with opportunities to invest at reduced valuations that position us for future growth and investment returns,” illustrating a systemic perspective, operational flexibility and dynamic capability to adapt to environmental perturbations. The firm describes a long-term investment horizon in which “capital deployed in any one quarter may vary significantly from the capital deployed in any other quarter,” underscoring its resource allocation processes and capacity for resource reconfiguration under fluctuating transaction activity. It carefully manages liquidity and capital requirements by “focusing on our cash flows” and identifying primary sources and uses of liquidity—ranging from funding capital commitments and warehouse investments to servicing debt obligations, underwriting and syndication commitments and making cash distributions under its distribution policy—thereby ensuring business continuity and competitive advantage under challenging conditions. The adoption of both GAAP and non-GAAP performance measures, its expense allocation methodology across private markets, public markets, capital markets and principal activities, and its consolidation and de-consolidation policies reflect transparency, organizational health and resilience strategies designed to preserve system integrity and performance. Its fund structures include “clawback” provisions and “netting hole” mechanisms that align incentives, provide risk mitigation and reinforce accountability toward investors, while its access to credit facilities, senior notes and derivative hedges demonstrates proactive risk management, crisis preparedness and strategic foresight. The firm’s use of multiple valuation techniques—such as market comparables and discounted cash flow analyses for level ii and level iii assets—enables rigorous fair value measurements, impact assessment and informed decision making, thereby supporting performance maintenance, resourcefulness and adaptability in the face of uncertainty and disruptive change.

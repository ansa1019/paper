AbbVie’s strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. In 2017, the company generated $10.0 billion of cash flows from operations, which it utilized to enhance its pipeline through licensing and collaboration activities, pay $4.1 billion in cash dividends and repurchase approximately 13 million shares for $1.0 billion in the open market. AbbVie expects to achieve its strategic objectives by diversifying revenue streams, driving late-stage pipeline assets to market and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches; continued investment and expansion in its pipeline; expanding operating margins through revenue leverage, supply chain productivity initiatives and ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses; and returning cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Research and innovation are identified as cornerstones of the business, with a pipeline of more than 60 compounds in clinical development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and strategic collaborations such as the global agreement with Alector to develop and commercialize neurodegenerative disease treatments, reflecting a systemic perspective and resource reconfiguration to absorb strain and preserve functioning amid scientific, regulatory and market uncertainties. The company monitors economic conditions and creditworthiness of customers, establishes allowances against accounts receivable and may utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, particularly with government health systems in Greece, Portugal, Italy and Spain and in oil-exporting countries such as Saudi Arabia and Russia, thereby enhancing its risk mitigation and business continuity capabilities. AbbVie maintains a $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility and has demonstrated access to capital markets through senior notes issuances, enabling financing flexibility and liquidity preservation in support of growth objectives and obligations. Management regularly reviews purchase commitments, contingent consideration liabilities—measured at fair value based on probabilities of success, discount rates and market assumptions—and pension and other post-employment benefit obligations, adjusting actuarial assumptions and funding plans to maintain system integrity and adapt to changes in interest rates, discount rates and healthcare cost trends. The company also conducts annual impairment assessments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and remeasures deferred tax liabilities in response to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, reflecting strategic foresight and the ability to maintain performance under adverse and exceptional conditions.

our vehicle production capability continued to scale and gain operational efficiencies, and vehicle production volume increased by 20% year-over-year; we have redirected our best engineering talent to gigafactory 1 to fine-tune the automated processes and related robotic programming not only to address the challenges we have experienced but also to continue evaluating our overall manufacturing process for efficiencies; these actions should result in our model 3 production rate significantly increasing during the first half of 2018; it is important to note that while these are the levels we are focused on hitting and we have plans in place to achieve them, our prior experience on the model 3 ramp has demonstrated the difficulty of accurately forecasting specific production rates at specific points in time; an overhaul of the underlying architecture of our software has been completed, which has enabled a step-change improvement in the collection and analysis of data and fundamentally enhanced its machine learning capabilities; the aggregate of such data and learnings, which we refer to as our “neural net,” is able to collect and analyze more high-quality data than ever before, enabling us to roll out a series of new autopilot features in 2018 and beyond; we have partnered with Panasonic to provide capital and operational support to manufacture PV cells, thus enabling high-volume integrated tile and PV cell production at our gigafactory 2 in Buffalo, New York; in late 2017, we completed installation of the largest battery in the world in South Australia, which delivers electricity during peak hours to help maintain the reliable operation of South Australia’s electrical infrastructure; as solar roof is truly the first-of-its-kind and there is significant complexity in both its manufacturing and installation, we are deliberately ramping production at a gradual pace to ensure reliability and a great customer experience; we have deemphasized absolute volume growth for our solar products, and we have instead prioritized projects for cash generation and profitability; we expect energy storage products to experience significant growth, with our aim being to at least triple our sales in 2018; we are ramping up production for these products at our gigafactory 1 over the next several quarters, but demand is greater than our current production capacity for energy storage; capital expenditures in 2018 are projected to be slightly more than 2017, with the majority of the spending to support increases in Model 3 production capacity at gigafactory 1 and the Tesla Factory, and for building additional stores, service centers and superchargers; we expect operating expenses to grow in 2018 as compared to 2017, although operating expenses should decrease significantly as a percentage of revenue due to the significant increase in expected revenue in 2018 and as we focus on increasing operational efficiency; we continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs and may raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our business; we expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our projection of cash flows from operating activities will provide us with adequate liquidity over at least the next 12 months; a large portion of our future expenditures is to fund our growth, and we can adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment, including future expansion of our product offerings, stores, service centers, delivery centers and supercharger network; although we continue to make progress to resolve such issues at gigafactory 1, given the size and complexity of this undertaking, it is possible that future events could result in the cost of building and operating gigafactory 1 exceeding our current expectations and gigafactory 1 taking longer to expand than we currently anticipate; we have an agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the state of New York during the 10-year period following full production at gigafactory 2, and we anticipate meeting these obligations through our operations at gigafactory 2 and other operations within the state of New York, and we do not believe that we face a significant risk of default; while we currently believe that our progress at gigafactory 1 will allow us to reach our production targets, our ultimate ability to do so will require us to resolve the types of challenges that are typical of a production ramp; if we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them, our operations and prospects could be negatively affected.

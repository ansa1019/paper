Management reported that operating fundamentals remained strong for its owned and managed portfolio, with occupancy of 97.2%, reflecting the maintenance of performance under external variations. During 2017, the company repositioned its portfolio and streamlined its co-investment ventures by selling its investment in Europe Logistics Venture 1 for $84 million and contributing properties to Prologis Targeted Europe Logistics Fund and Prologis European Properties Fund II (renamed PELF) in exchange for equity interests, acquiring partners’ interests in Prologis North American Industrial Fund for $710 million and the Brazil Logistics Partners Fund I for $80 million to reconstitute its operating portfolio and preserve or improve functioning despite market fluctuations. It amended its Japanese yen revolver and increased total borrowing capacity to ¥50.0 billion, issued £500 million of senior notes maturing in 2029 at 99.9% of par value and redeemed $618 million of higher-coupon debt, actions that demonstrate resource generation, risk mitigation and operational continuity under challenging conditions. The use of net operating income by segment as a supplemental measure and same-store portfolio analyses removing one-time items such as net termination and renegotiation fees support informed resource allocation and performance maintenance. Development stabilization activity, moving developed properties into the operating portfolio when completed for one year or 90% occupied, illustrates the firm’s capacity to absorb strain and adapt its asset base. Contribution and disposition activity generated proceeds of $4.5 billion and realized net gains of $1.2 billion, reflecting financial flexibility and adaptive strategies. Liquidity and capital resources—including $1.7 billion of cash from operating activities, $307 million of distributions from unconsolidated entities and available borrowing capacity of $3.1 billion—together with compliance with debt covenants and maintenance of investment-grade ratings, underscore preparedness for unexpected situations and preservation of system integrity. Critical accounting policies on consolidation, revenue recognition, impairment assessments and capitalization of development costs provide transparency and support evaluation of core operating performance, while management’s use of modified and core funds from operations measures, excluding deferred tax, foreign currency-related items and nonrecurring gains or losses, facilitates consistent performance assessment and strategic foresight in turbulent markets.

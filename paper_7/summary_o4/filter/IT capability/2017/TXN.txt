In 2017, our strategic decision to invest in manufacturing technologies and maintain direct control over in-house semiconductor production helped ensure a consistent supply of products for customers and supported higher factory loadings—yielding approximately a 40 percent cost advantage per unpackaged chip—while acquisitions of mature assets ahead of demand further lowered manufacturing costs; at the same time, we continued allocating resources from manufacturing support and SG&A into R&D, investing over $1 billion annually to expand a broad portfolio of tens of thousands of analog and embedded processing products and diversify markets and customer positions so as not to be dependent on any single product, application or customer. These measures underpinned our ability to preserve and enhance operational performance amid fluctuations in demand, as evidenced by a gross margin of 64.3 percent, cash flows from operations of $5.36 billion, free cash flow of $4.67 billion and the maintenance of liquidity sources that include $4.47 billion in cash and short-term investments plus an undrawn $2 billion revolving credit facility. Our capital management strategy—which emphasizes productive reinvestment of free cash flow, its return to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases, disciplined inventory and working capital management (31 days sales outstanding, 134 days of inventory) and targeted capital expenditures of $695 million for semiconductor equipment—reflects a systemic approach to resource deployment, risk mitigation and operational flexibility that enables the company to absorb strain, maintain system integrity under internal and external variations and sustain competitive advantage and long-term resilience.

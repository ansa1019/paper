Merck’s MD&A discloses multiple instances of organizational resilience in response to adversity and strategic imperatives: on June 27, 2017, the company experienced a network cyber-attack that disrupted its worldwide operations, including manufacturing, research and sales operations, yet all manufacturing sites were restored to full operation—manufacturing API, formulating, packaging and shipping product—with external manufacturing unaffected and the company continuing to fulfill orders and ship product despite an anticipated $260 million sales impact, incurring approximately $285 million in remediation and manufacturing variances (net of $45 million in insurance recoveries) and borrowing doses of Gardasil 9 from the CDC pediatric vaccine stockpile (later partially replenished) to meet customer needs; in September 2017, Hurricane Maria made direct landfall on Puerto Rico, and although the island’s infrastructure suffered significant damage, Merck’s plant resumed production, prepared alternative power and water sources and continued to make progress restoring supply chains, resulting in only an immaterial impact on sales; the company has also pursued global restructuring programs designed to streamline its cost structure and improve operational flexibility by eliminating positions, closing or divesting certain manufacturing and R&D sites and consolidating office facilities while reducing its real estate footprint; augmenting its portfolio and pipeline with external innovation remains an important component of its overall strategy and the company continues to prioritize internal and external resource allocation to maximize opportunities for ongoing and upcoming product launches; Merck’s strong financial profile, including a $6 billion five-year credit facility, high-quality investment policy guidelines, comprehensive revenue and balance-sheet foreign currency hedging programs and interest-rate swaps, enables it to absorb strain, mitigate risks and preserve performance under internal and external variations and disturbances, in line with the maintenance of integrity and performance under challenging conditions.

In 2017, the company responded to unexpected supply‐chain and quality disruptions by initiating a voluntary product recall in August and discontinuing business with the third‐party supplier, bringing oral care solution manufacturing in‐house to reestablish control over production processes; shipping of in‐house and FDA-tested sage products resumed in September 2017, and full supply capacity was restored by year-end, demonstrating rapid reconfiguration of operations and recovery from external pressures. The impact of hurricanes and inflation on gross profit was partially offset by higher sales volumes and increased productivity, reflecting operational flexibility under environmental perturbations. Capital allocation priorities—acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases—guided deployment of $831 million for acquisitions, $636 million in dividends and $230 million in share repurchases, while investments in the development of a global ERP system and new plant and equipment supported business continuity and system resilience. Operating cash flow served as the primary source of funding for operating needs and capital expenditures, with excess cash first directed to acquisitions and supplemented by debt financing as necessary; the company maintained strong investment-grade credit ratings, available commercial paper capacity and a $1.5 billion credit facility to mitigate liquidity risks and ensure resource availability.

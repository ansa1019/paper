During September 2017, Hurricane Irma caused damage throughout much of FPLâ€™s service territory and resulted in approximately 4.4 million customers losing electrical service; FPL restored power to approximately 50% of affected customers within one day and to approximately 95% within seven days, and following enactment of tax reform used available reserve amortization to offset nearly all storm restoration costs and plans to replenish the reserve through future tax savings under the 2016 rate agreement, illustrating rapid recovery, adaptive resource allocation and operational flexibility under exceptional conditions. NEE and its subsidiaries maintain liquidity and continuity by supporting capital requirements through cash flow from operations, short- and long-term borrowings, issuance of debt and equity securities, proceeds from differential membership investors and bank revolving credit and letter-of-credit facilities, with credit and capital market access overseen by risk management policies that include derivative instruments to manage fuel, electricity, interest rate and foreign currency exposures, counterparty credit limits, master netting agreements and collateral requirements, all approved by the Exposure Management Committee and chief executive officer to mitigate market volatility and ensure system integrity. Management also uses adjusted earnings, excluding non-qualifying hedge activity, for internal financial planning, performance analysis, board reporting and incentive compensation purposes, thereby preserving performance comparability under earnings volatility. NEE evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate potential unrecoverability, recognizes asset retirement obligations for nuclear decommissioning and plant dismantlement based on regulatory-approved studies, and maintains funded pension obligations using actuarial assumptions for discount rates, compensation increases and expected long-term returns, all reflecting forward-looking resource planning and risk assessment to absorb strain, preserve functioning and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Regulatory accounting under cost-based rate regulation results in recorded regulatory assets and liabilities that represent probable future recoveries or refunds through ratemaking, enabling alignment of financial resources with obligations and sustaining organizational coherence despite regulatory changes, while strategic equity programs and inter-organizational collaboration, such as the Nextera Energy Partners offerings, support ongoing investment and growth to transform and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

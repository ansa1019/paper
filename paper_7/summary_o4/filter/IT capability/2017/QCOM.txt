During fiscal 2017, we continued to invest significant resources toward advancements primarily in support of 4G OFDMA- and 5G-based technologies as well as adjacent industry segments outside traditional cellular industries, such as automotive, the Internet of Things and networking, to extend demand for our products and generate new or expanded licensing opportunities, and achieved cost reduction initiatives under our strategic realignment plan to improve operational flexibility under changing market conditions. We announced a definitive agreement under which Qualcomm River Holdings will acquire NXP Semiconductors for $38 billion, an initiative that is expected to require significant allocation of management time, cash and other financial resources, including the May 2017 issuance of $11.0 billion in unsecured floating- and fixed-rate notes, a $5.0 billion revolving credit facility, commercial paper programs and the establishment of $2.0 billion in fully collateralized letters of credit to support potential termination fees. To mitigate regulatory and legal pressures, we recorded $927 million and $778 million in charges related to KFTC and TFTC fines, respectively, increased legal and compliance expenditures, and pursued litigation and arbitration to compel Appleâ€™s contract manufacturers to report and pay royalties and to resolve ongoing disputes with certain licensees, demonstrating our ability to absorb strain and preserve licensing functionality. We manage seasonality and supply chain dynamics by aligning manufacturing and inventory with customer demand cycles, as evidenced by a 31 percent increase in QCT inventories and increased days sales outstanding driven by royalty collection timing, and maintain system integrity through critical accounting estimates in areas including impairment of marketable securities in anticipation of divestitures, valuation of inventories, goodwill and intangible assets, as well as provisions for legal, regulatory and tax contingencies. These measures reflect our capacity to adapt resources, reconfigure operational structures and maintain performance under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

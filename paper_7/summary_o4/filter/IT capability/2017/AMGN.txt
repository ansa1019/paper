Amgen continued to provide an uninterrupted supply of medicines worldwide while responding to natural disasters and investing for future growth, exemplified by the resilience of its critical manufacturing areas in Juncos, Puerto Rico, which resumed full operations following Hurricane Maria in September 2017. The company invested in next-generation biomanufacturing, reducing the scale and cost of biologics production while ensuring a reliable, high-quality, compliant supply through its newly approved Singapore facility. Significant transformation and process-improvement efforts have optimized the business and operating model, establishing a foundation for growth, enabling resource reallocation to fund innovative pipeline and growth opportunities, and generating approximately $1.5 billion of savings since 2014, reinvested in product launches, clinical programs and external innovation partnerships. In preparation for 2018, Amgen expanded transformation and savings initiatives to support new and existing products and to optimize long- and short-term growth, with operating, SG&A and R&D expenses benefiting from these efforts to enhance operational flexibility and development speed. The companyâ€™s forward-looking strategies and hedging activities seek to mitigate risks from foreign-currency fluctuations, regulatory scrutiny and pricing pressures, while its strong cash flows and global access to $41.7 billion of liquidity, strategic dividends and stock repurchase programs, ample financing arrangements and disciplined capital allocation reinforce its ability to absorb internal or external disturbances, maintain continuity of operations and pursue strategic resilience against evolving industry and economic challenges.

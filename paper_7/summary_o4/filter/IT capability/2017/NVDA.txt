We maintain broad liquidity and diversified financial resources—cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities managed under risk-based duration limits and supported by a revolving credit facility and commercial paper program—to ensure operational continuity and the ability to absorb external disturbances; we proactively adjust inventory commitments and rebate accruals based on forecasts of customer demand, third-party manufacturing lead times, competitive pricing actions, product transitions and macroeconomic conditions, and conduct periodic impairment reviews to mitigate valuation risk and preserve performance; we have adapted our tax and cash management practices to the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act through provisional transition tax planning and recognition of net tax benefits, thereby maintaining resource availability and compliance under changing regulations; we allocate capital to strategic initiatives—including gaming, professional visualization, datacenter, autonomous driving and AI platforms—and pursue partnerships with cloud providers, OEMs and automotive suppliers to reconfigure our offerings and reconstitute operational trajectories in response to disruptive events; we have executed restructuring actions—such as the wind-down of modem operations and the purchase of our Santa Clara campus—to realign resources and strengthen our capacity for positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

ServiceNow continues to invest in the development of its services, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth and improve service quality and reduce costs while scaling and automating its business, increasing employee headcount and expanding data center capacity. The Company generally bills customers annually in advance for subscription services and monthly in arrears for professional services, recognizing subscription revenues ratably over contract terms and amortizing deferred commissions on a straight-line basis to align costs with performance. To address external pressures and currency volatility, ServiceNow translates foreign currency results consistently, anticipates the initiation of a hedging program for significant transactions, maintains valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and assesses uncertain tax positions, and continually monitors renewal rates, billings and free cash flow as indicators of organizational strength. In response to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard under Topic 606 and the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company has reconfigured its revenue recognition policies, classified proceeds from user forums as a reduction in sales and marketing expense, deferred incremental commission costs over estimated benefit periods, remeasured deferred tax assets and liabilities, and adjusted its deferred revenue and expense classifications to preserve integrity and performance under evolving accounting and regulatory regimes. ServiceNow conducts impairment testing for goodwill and long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment, reassessing useful lives and carrying values to ensure the systemâ€™s ability to maintain integrity and performance under varying conditions. The Company manages debt obligations, including convertible senior notes, associated hedges and planned repayments, expects its liquidity from cash, cash equivalents and investments to be sufficient to meet operational and strategic needs for at least the next 12 months, and actively evaluates the need for additional capital resources through equity or debt financing to support growth. The Company acknowledges seasonality in contract signing and collections, driven by budget cycles and commission incentives, but cautions that historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, thereby maintaining operational agility and resilience under adverse or exceptional conditions.

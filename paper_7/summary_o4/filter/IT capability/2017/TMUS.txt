During the third and fourth quarters of 2017, our operations in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico experienced losses related to hurricanes and, while recognizing approximately $93 million of insurance recoveries in 2017, we continue to assess the damage and work with our carriers to submit claims for property and business interruption losses and expect to record additional recoveries in future periods. In response to regulatory changes deemed to render the Lifeline program uneconomical, we excluded approximately 4.5 million Lifeline customers from our reported wholesale subscriber base while continuing to support our wholesale partners offering that program. Our Un-carrier strategy, introduced in 2013 to eliminate customer pain points arising from industry complexity, has, we believe, succeeded in attracting and retaining customers as evidenced by continued branded customer growth and improved branded customer churn. As part of our network transformation, we accelerated lease cost recognition to decommission the MetroPCS CDMA network and certain redundant cell sites—incurring network decommissioning costs in 2017 but expecting no significant additional costs in 2018—and acquired 1,525 licenses in the FCC’s 600 MHz spectrum auction for $8.0 billion, of which $5.8 billion was paid in May 2017 using cash reserves and debt, and began deployment of those licenses in the third quarter. To maintain financial flexibility and support ongoing capital needs, we deploy vendor and handset financing arrangements to extend payment terms, sell certain Equipment Installment Plan receivables on a revolving basis, and in January 2017 entered into a $4.0 billion secured term loan facility with Deutsche Telekom AG, followed by the issuance in March 2017 and January 2018 of senior notes whose net proceeds were used to redeem callable high-yield debt. These actions, together with focused cost control and synergies realized from the MetroPCS combination, contributed to a 5 percent increase in adjusted EBITDA to $11.2 billion and a 30 percent increase in net cash provided by operating activities to $8.0 billion, resulting in free cash flow of $2.7 billion, up 90 percent year over year.

Gilead’s MD&A emphasizes the company’s operational resilience, noting that 2017 “was marked by operational excellence across our business, as we accomplished many key goals that position us for future growth,” while continuing to “execute on and maximize the opportunity in HCV in a changing competitive landscape” and advance its product pipeline to address unmet medical needs. The company reports operations in more than 35 countries worldwide and uses foreign currency exchange contracts “to hedge a percentage of our foreign currency exposure” as part of its risk mitigation strategy against an “uncertain global macroeconomic environment” and “volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.” Gilead describes its R&D management as a dynamic process whereby the company “identif[ies] the R&D activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources and other considerations,” continuously reviewing the pipeline and “reallocate[ing] resources among the R&D portfolio that we believe will best support the future growth of our business.” In discussing liquidity and capital resources, the MD&A states “we believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by our cash flows generated from operating activities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future,” highlighting the generation of $11.9 billion in operating cash flow, the strategic use of $3.0 billion in senior unsecured notes and $6.0 billion in term loan facilities to finance acquisitions, and the maintenance of a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility for working capital and general corporate purposes. The company also underscores its capacity to adapt to competitive and regulatory pressures through strategic initiatives such as licensing agreements to expand access in low- and middle-income countries, a disciplined stock repurchase and dividend program, and proactive evaluation of tax reform impacts—including a provisional $5.5 billion net charge and ongoing assessment of global intangible low-taxed income provisions—while cautioning that “we may in the future require additional funding … we cannot guarantee that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all.” Gilead further illustrates its ability to reconfigure inter-organizational collaborations by terminating its BMS joint venture upon generic EFV launch and consolidating full ownership, thereby preserving business continuity and resource control in the face of external change.

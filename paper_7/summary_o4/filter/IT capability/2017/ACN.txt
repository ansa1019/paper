The Company continuously monitors macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility and seeks to manage costs in order to respond to changing conditions, proactively planning and managing workforce size, composition and compensation to align its supply of skills and resources with current and projected client demand while maintaining utilization rates; it adjusts pricing and the mix of resources to mitigate the impact of compensation increases on gross margin, conducts rigorous pre-contract reviews to evaluate the achievability of performance-based incentives, and applies percentage-of-completion accounting with ongoing reassessment of contract profitability—recognizing loss provisions when estimated costs exceed expected revenues—and defers transition costs for outsourcing contracts, amortizing them over the service period and monitoring deferred amounts for impairment in the event of early termination; the Company also seeks to manage foreign exchange exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as revenues through contractual currency protection provisions and hedging programs, maintains liquidity and funding flexibility via cash flows from operations, cash reserves, a commercial paper program and committed credit facilities, and may deploy available or additional funds for strategic investments, share repurchases or accelerated expansion, thereby preserving its operational integrity, adaptability and performance under varying internal and external pressures.

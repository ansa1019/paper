In our management’s discussion and analysis, we emphasize our strategic alignment through the “consumer direct offense” announced in June 2017 designed to allow Nike to better serve the consumer personally at scale, leveraging digital capabilities to accelerate innovation and product creation, move closer to the consumer through key cities and deepen one-to-one connections. We pursue operational flexibility and resilience by reducing product costs through manufacturing efficiency, product design and innovation; by making our supply chain a competitive advantage through investments in new technologies that increase automation, reduce waste and enhance customization and speed to market; and by driving growth in our higher-gross-margin direct-to-consumer business as part of an integrated marketplace growth strategy. We manage volatility in foreign currency translation and transactional exposures centrally on a portfolio basis, employing natural offsets and derivative hedges for cash flow, embedded derivative and balance-sheet exposures, and hedging available-for-sale U.S. dollar investments to mitigate the translation impact on consolidated net earnings. Despite foreign currency headwinds, we achieved record revenues, earnings per share and cash returns while investing in infrastructure, new direct-to-consumer stores and expanding digital capabilities to support future growth. Our use of non-GAAP measures, including currency-neutral revenues and wholesale equivalent revenues, provides enhanced visibility into operational trends and supports decision-making under fluctuating market conditions. We maintain focus on working-capital efficiency, effective capital deployment and committed credit facilities—including a $2 billion revolving credit facility and commercial-paper program—to ensure business continuity, adaptability and liquidity. Our capital allocation framework, encompassing a multi-year share repurchase program and public debt issuances, is designed to preserve financial resources and optimize returns under challenging conditions. In assessing our results, we maintain allowances for inventory valuation, receivables collectability and contingent liabilities, and we continuously refine critical accounting estimates—such as revenue recognition, hedge accounting and tax provisioning—to ensure the integrity of performance measurement and readiness for unexpected shifts in the business environment.

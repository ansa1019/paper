Bank of America Corporation’s 2017 annual report describes a formal, enterprise-wide risk framework, approved annually by the Board, for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks and articulates a clear risk appetite that specifies the capital, earnings and liquidity at risk in pursuit of its strategic objectives; this framework incorporates stress forecasting and contingency funding planning—such as global liquidity sources, time-to-required funding metrics, and recovery and resolution planning—to ensure the Corporation’s ability to absorb strain, maintain operational continuity and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions; asset-liability management and hedging programs are used to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk in the banking book, with projected net interest income under parallel and non-parallel rate shocks regularly assessed, while a centralized funding approach, diversified sources, contingent lines of credit and pre-approved debt issuance authorizations support business continuity under liquidity stress; capital management processes—including the internal capital adequacy assessment process, CCAR planning and maintenance of Basel III buffers, total loss-absorbing capacity requirements and supplementary leverage ratios—are in place to ensure adequate resources to meet minimum regulatory requirements and to support strategic initiatives even in adverse scenarios; dedicated operational risk governance, reinforced by three lines of defense and an independent model validation policy, enables the early identification and mitigation of process, systems and people-related failures; mortgage banking risk management combines hedges of interest rate lock commitments, loans held-for-sale and servicing rights to offset prepayment and interest-rate risks; and comprehensive compliance and reputational risk programs, together with regular scenario analysis and stress testing of trading, credit and liquidity exposures, collectively embody capabilities for adaptation, recovery and maintenance of performance under both expected and unexpected internal or external variations.

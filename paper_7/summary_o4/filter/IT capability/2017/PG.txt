During fiscal 2017, management’s discussion emphasized the company’s ability to adapt to internal and external pressures by implementing and sustaining cost-improvement and productivity initiatives, including outsourcing projects, supply-chain optimization, manufacturing savings projects and multi-year cost-reduction programs designed to protect margins under commodity, foreign-exchange and macroeconomic volatility. Initiatives such as streamlining the product portfolio through divesting, discontinuing or consolidating non-strategic brands, accelerating decision-making processes, reconfiguring management and work processes, enhancing clarity of roles, accountability and incentive compensation, and maintaining disciplined investment during periods of significant macroeconomic uncertainty illustrate the company’s approach to risk mitigation, resource reconfiguration and long-term organizational health. The firm’s strategic focus on innovation—leveraging consumer insights and technology advancements for product improvements, improved marketing and merchandising programs and game-changing inventions—along with portfolio reshaping across ten reportable segments, demonstrates its capacity to preserve performance and competitive advantage in highly fragmented markets. The MD&A describes robust liquidity and financial flexibility supported by strong operating cash flow generation, disciplined capital expenditures and prudent use of debt, complemented by hedging and other risk-management activities to absorb currency, commodity and interest-rate fluctuations. Moreover, responses to evolving government policies and controls—highlighted by the deconsolidation of Venezuelan subsidiaries due to a lack of exchangeability—underscore the company’s systemic ability to reconstitute its operations and maintain integrity of performance despite exceptional conditions. Financial and operational metrics, including organic sales growth, adjusted free cash flow productivity and core earnings per share, serve as management’s tools for monitoring and sustaining resilience, while contractual commitments, liquidity management and strong credit ratings provide the capital-structure flexibility required to support ongoing adaptation and resource deployment under a range of potential disruptions.

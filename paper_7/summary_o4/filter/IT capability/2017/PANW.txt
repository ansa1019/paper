Our 2017 MD&A discloses a suite of strategic investments and operational practices designed to preserve integrity and maintain performance under both nominal and exceptional conditions, reflecting the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. We describe how our next-generation security platform “enables our end-customers to maintain the visibility and control needed to protect their valued data and critical control systems while pursuing technology initiatives, like cloud and mobility,” thereby simplifying security operations, eliminating multiple stand-alone appliances, reducing total cost of ownership, and supporting operational flexibility and resilience. We “continue to invest in and extend our platform,” evidenced by the February 2017 launch of new physical and virtual firewall appliances, the delivery of PAN-OS 8.0 with expanded public and private cloud security functionality, and the acquisition of behavioral-analytics technology, all of which illustrate an adaptive trajectory model of resilience that allows rapid projection, reconstitution, and reconfiguration of response paths toward emerging objectives. Our adoption of a hybrid SaaS revenue model—combining product, subscriptions, and support—generates recurring revenues and deferred revenue balances that management monitors as key metrics, including billings, cash flow provided by operating activities, and free cash flow, to evaluate growth trends, allocate resources, mitigate risks, and ensure sufficient liquidity. To manage growth effectively, we “must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner,” thereby reinforcing capacity to absorb strain from environmental disruptions and sustain our competitive position. Capital allocation measures, such as our up-to-$1 billion share repurchase program funded from available working capital and our convertible debt structure, deliver financial flexibility under variable market conditions. In our accounting policies and critical estimates, we recognize revenue upon delivery, allocate consideration based on best estimates of selling price, establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, accrue for manufacturing purchase commitments against demand forecasts to address supply-chain variability, evaluate uncertain tax positions, and perform impairment analyses of goodwill and long-lived assets, all of which constitute proactive risk mitigation mechanisms and collateral learning processes that uphold organizational health and performance maintenance in the face of pressures, constraints, and unanticipated events.

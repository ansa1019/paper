Philip Morris International states that it is building its future on smoke-free products through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation aimed at ensuring these products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements, and envisions that these products ultimately replace cigarettes to the benefit of adult smokers, society, the company and its shareholders. Effective January 1, 2018, the company reorganized its operations into six reportable segments to provide greater focus on combustible and reduced-risk products and to support its transformation toward a smoke-free future. The company notes that net revenues and operating income are affected by volume, price, currency exchange rates and product mix, and it includes excise taxes in net revenues when collected and remitted on behalf of customers. Costs of sales principally comprise tobacco leaf, non-tobacco raw materials, labor, manufacturing costs and third-party device costs, while marketing, administration and research costs reflect investments in marketing and sales, general corporate expenses and development of new products. As a holding company, PMIâ€™s principal sources of funds to service debt are dividends and debt repayments from its subsidiaries, which are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay dividends or make distributions. The company reports that unfavorable currency movements, especially against the Brazilian real, Egyptian pound, euro, Japanese yen and Turkish lira, have impacted profitability across primary revenue markets and local cost bases, and it forecasts 2018 capital expenditures of approximately $1.7 billion and an effective tax rate of approximately 28%, excluding the impact of future acquisitions, unanticipated impairment or exit costs, changes in currency exchange rates, developments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other unusual events, with the factors described in Item 1A reflecting continuing risks to these projections.

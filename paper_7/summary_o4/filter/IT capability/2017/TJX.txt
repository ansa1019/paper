The company’s MD&A discloses that forward-looking statements regarding financial performance are made pursuant to safe harbor provisions and are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in Part I, Item 1A, and in other SEC filings; the business employs inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on merchandise purchases, recording mark-to-market gains or losses each period that are offset when inventory is received and paid for; ongoing investments in supply chain infrastructure include opening new distribution centers to manage higher supply chain costs and process increased unit volumes, while approximately $1.4 billion of capital expenditures for fiscal 2019 are planned to support growth in offices, distribution centers, store renovations and new store openings; in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, 37 stores significantly impacted by hurricanes were excluded from comparable-store sales and will be reintegrated once operational criteria are met, reflecting the company’s emphasis on business continuity and recovery following disruptive events; liquidity requirements continue to be funded principally through cash generated from operations, supplemented by available credit facilities, with $2.8 billion in cash and $0.5 billion in short-term investments on hand as of February 3, 2018, and the expectation that existing resources are more than adequate to meet operating needs over the next fiscal year; and, following the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the company recorded a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate, reinvesting a portion of the tax benefits in discretionary associate bonuses, enhanced retirement plan contributions and charitable foundations, with provisional amounts subject to refinement as additional guidance and analyses become available.

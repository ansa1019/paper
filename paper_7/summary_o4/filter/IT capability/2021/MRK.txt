During the COVID-19 pandemic Merck has remained focused on protecting the safety of its employees, ensuring that its supply of medicines and vaccines reaches its patients, contributing its scientific expertise to the development of an antiviral therapy, supporting efforts to expand manufacturing capacity and supply of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 medicines and vaccines, and supporting health care providers and Merck’s communities. Although COVID-19-related disruptions negatively affected results in 2021 and 2020, Merck continues to experience strong global underlying demand across its business, and operating expenses reflect a minor positive effect in 2021 as investments in COVID-19-related research largely offset the favorable impact of lower spending in other areas due to the pandemic. The company notes that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption and volatility in its global supply chain network and may in the future experience disruptions in availability and delays in shipments of raw materials and packaging, as well as related cost inflation. To advance its response to environmental disruptions, Merck entered into multiple agreements in March 2021—including with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and Johnson & Johnson—to adapt and make available manufacturing facilities and expand capacity to produce COVID-19 vaccines and medicines, and has entered into advance purchase and supply agreements for molnupiravir in more than 30 markets. In parallel, Merck has executed a global restructuring program as part of a worldwide initiative focused on optimizing its manufacturing and supply network and reducing its global real estate footprint, with actions expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2023 and anticipated to generate annual net cost savings of approximately $900 million. Merck’s strong financial profile—including cash provided by operating activities, access to commercial paper and long-term borrowings, and a $6 billion revolving credit facility—enables it to fund research and development, support in-line products and upcoming launches, pursue strategic acquisitions and collaborations, and provide significant cash returns to shareholders, and the company believes that its sources of financing will be adequate to meet its future requirements. To mitigate volatility in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, Merck has established revenue hedging, balance sheet risk management and net investment hedging programs and utilizes interest rate swap contracts. In addition, the acquisitions of Pandion and Acceleron, and collaborations with Gilead Sciences and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, reflect Merck’s efforts to reconfigure its research and development trajectory, allocate resources toward new therapeutic modalities and bolster its resilience amid external pressures.

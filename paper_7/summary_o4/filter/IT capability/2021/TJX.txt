During fiscal 2022, TJX navigated environmental perturbations, including the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical disruptions, by preserving and improving its functioning under adversity through strategic resource allocation, risk mitigation and system resilience initiatives. While government-mandated temporary store closures in Europe, Canada and Australia resulted in aggregate closures of approximately 4% of the fiscal year, TJX maintained business continuity by keeping U.S. stores and e-commerce operations open, temporarily reporting “open-only comp store sales” and comparing results to pre-pandemic baselines to provide insight into its adaptive response. The health and safety of associates and customers remained a top priority, with ongoing monitoring of developments and government requirements to assess potential operational impacts. To absorb strain from supply chain stress, the company increased average per store inventories by 31%, invested in distribution capacity and higher wages, and employed inventory-related hedging instruments, recording mark-to-market gains or losses in cost of sales while managing translational and transactional foreign exchange risk. Financial resilience was enhanced through proactive liquidity management—maintaining $6.2 billion in cash, $1.5 billion in available credit facilities and internally generated funds—alongside strategic reconfiguration of its capital structure via make-whole calls, debt extinguishments and dynamic adjustments to its dividend and share repurchase programs. TJX also continued its focus on critical accounting estimates—including retail-method inventory valuation, shrinkage estimation and reserves for uncertain tax positions—to ensure system integrity and performance maintenance, reflecting a multifaceted approach to sustaining organizational effectiveness, operational flexibility and competitive advantage in turbulent markets.

In fiscal 2021, Cisco delivered growth in revenue in a very challenging environment driven by the accelerated digitization and cloud investments stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on executing and innovating to support customers’ transition to hybrid work by increasing investments in their technologies. The company continues to operate in an uncertain, highly competitive macroeconomic environment while aggressively investing in priority areas to drive profitable long-term growth. Amid internal and external disturbances, Cisco managed supply chain constraints—including component shortages, extended lead times and increased costs for expedited logistics—by partnering with key suppliers, utilizing volume purchasing, extending supply coverage and revising supplier arrangements, and by performing value engineering efforts to improve manufacturing productivity. Cisco is integrating its platforms across networking, security, collaboration, applications and the cloud to provide a secure, intelligent platform for digital business, thereby reinforcing operational flexibility, systemic integration and service innovation. The company initiated a restructuring plan with a voluntary early retirement program to realign resources toward strategic initiatives, estimating annualized cost savings of $1 billion while preserving organizational effectiveness and future orientation. During the pandemic, Cisco maintained business continuity and workforce resilience through a long-standing flexible work policy, seamless transition to work-from-home, and robust health and safety measures for on-site staff, while offering free trials of Webex and security technologies, committing funds to pandemic response, and providing technology, financial support and PPE to communities and first responders. Cisco’s liquidity and capital allocation strategy—supported by strong cash, highly rated investments, access to committed credit facilities and defined free cash flow generation—enables the company to support working capital needs, strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures, customer financing activities, share repurchases, and dividends, thereby sustaining integrity and performance under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions. Remaining performance obligations and deferred product revenue increased year-over-year, driven by recurring software subscriptions and long-term service contracts, reflecting Cisco’s shift to software and subscription-based offerings. The company’s $3 billion revolving credit facility, commercial paper program, and stringent debt covenant compliance further underpin its capacity for risk mitigation, resource generation and system resilience.

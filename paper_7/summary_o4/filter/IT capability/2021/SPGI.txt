S&P Global’s disclosures reflect a multifaceted approach to sustaining performance and preserving organizational integrity under internal and external pressures. Management continues to closely monitor the evolving impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of the business, acknowledging uncertainty around its ultimate effect on future operations while noting that it did not materially affect reported results for 2021 and 2020. The company emphasizes maintenance of a strong financial position and business continuity through proactive liquidity and capital resource management, stating that “cash on hand, cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facility are expected to be sufficient to meet any additional operating and recurring cash needs into the foreseeable future.” This resilience is supported by a disciplined framework launched in 2018—“Powering the Markets of the Future”—which focuses on enhancing foundational capabilities, evolving core businesses, pursuing growth via adjacencies and technology investments, and meeting strategic priorities such as cost and revenue synergies, ESG leadership, and innovation in data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning. S&P Global has reconfigured its portfolio through targeted acquisitions and divestitures (including the acquisition of The Climate Service and planned sale of CGS and LCD businesses), deployed risk-mitigation strategies such as a revolving $1.5 billion credit facility with sustainability-linked pricing and engagement in divestitures to satisfy regulatory conditions, and transferred pension obligations via a group annuity contract to absorb actuarial risk. The company also continues to strengthen operational flexibility by reimagining hybrid work models, enhancing tools and processes to support data-driven decision making, maintaining rigorous risk management and compliance controls, and advancing technical capabilities and data transformation to preserve and improve firm performance amidst regulatory changes and market volatility.

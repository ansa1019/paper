In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated operational disruptions, Boston Scientific’s global crisis management team has focused on protecting employees and customers, optimizing operations through business continuity plans—such as establishing a medical advisory group, leveraging work-from-home infrastructure, accelerating remote physician support, and securing its supply chain—and monitoring return-to-office strategies based on science and data. To preserve functioning under resource constraints and economic uncertainty, the Company implemented strategic cost-reduction and cash-management measures—including reduced travel, meetings and hiring, a temporary four-day work week, and proactive amendments to credit facilities—while replacing its 2018 revolving credit facility with a $2.75 billion facility maturing in 2026, refinancing short-term floating-rate debt into long-term fixed-rate senior notes, prepaying debt obligations, and maintaining compliance with financial covenants. A global restructuring program approved in 2018, with expanded cost estimates in 2022, targets $425 million to $525 million of pre-tax charges to be substantially complete by end of 2022 and reinvests savings into strategic growth initiatives. Concurrently, the Company has pursued strategic investments in emerging markets infrastructure and acquisitions—supported by rigorous due diligence, contingent consideration monitoring, and integration plans—to enhance adaptability and future orientation. Cybersecurity governance and escalation frameworks have been established to assess and mitigate technology-related risks, ensuring timely reporting of incidents with potential operational or reputational impact. Moreover, environmental, social and governance commitments—such as ISO and LEED certifications, renewable energy goals, and diversity and inclusion metrics—reflect a systemic perspective on sustaining organizational health, integrity and performance. Collectively, these measures demonstrate the Company’s ability to absorb strain, reallocate resources, adapt to external pressures and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

As the world continues to respond to COVID-19, we are working to ensure the safety of our employees, striving to protect the health and well-being of the communities in which we operate, and providing technology and resources to our customers to help them do their best work while remote. Our markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive, and we must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins, while extended disruptions at our third-party contract manufacturers could lead to similar disruptions in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand. We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; enhance investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification. We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy, and we expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees worldwide by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow oneâ€™s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. We use metrics to assess the health of our business and make informed decisions regarding the allocation of resources, providing transparency into our performance trends and reflecting the evolution of our products and services.

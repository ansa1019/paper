Management’s Discussion and Analysis repeatedly highlights structures and strategic actions designed to preserve PepsiCo’s integrity and performance under internal or external pressures, including the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, climate-related risks, supply-chain disruptions, inflationary pressures and macro-political volatility, by implementing health and safety protocols, business-continuity and crisis-management plans; by embedding resilience into the “Pep+” transformation, which reconfigures operations from regenerative agriculture to a circular value chain and new low-packaging platforms to sustain resource allocation and functional performance across adverse conditions; by diversifying sourcing, distribution networks and sales channels (including e-commerce and direct-to-consumer models) to maintain operational flexibility and meet shifting consumer and customer needs; by leveraging an integrated risk-management framework—overseen by the Board and its committees and executed through a cross-functional Risk Committee, divisional and country risk teams and a centralized Risk Management Office—to identify, assess, prioritize, mitigate and monitor key strategic, financial, operational, compliance, safety, reputational and sustainability risks; and by using productivity and efficiency initiatives, fixed-price contracts, global purchasing agreements and derivative hedging of commodities, foreign exchange and interest-rate exposures to absorb strain, mitigate volatility and maintain competitive advantage and business continuity under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

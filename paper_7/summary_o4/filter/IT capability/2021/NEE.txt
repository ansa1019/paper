NEE’s MD&A discloses a comprehensive risk management framework and financial structure designed to absorb strain and preserve functioning under internal and external disturbances, including regulatory mechanisms to defer and recover incremental storm restoration costs incurred at FPL following hurricanes and tropical storms through reserve amortization under the 2016 and 2021 rate agreements, thereby maintaining targeted regulatory returns while promoting operational continuity. The company emphasizes liquidity and capital resources—cash flows from operations, short- and long-term borrowings, equity issuances, proceeds from differential membership interests and asset sales—to support working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and emergency management, with NEE, FPL and NEECH maintaining investment-grade credit ratings and undrawn credit and letter-of-credit facilities to address collateral requirements or operating facility losses. Guarantee arrangements, including equity contribution, power purchase and project financing guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds, as well as indemnifications, facilitate uninterrupted project-level operations and intercompany support. Commodity price and interest rate risks are managed through derivative instruments—swaps, options, futures and forwards—under Energy Exposure Management Committee oversight, employing value-at-risk modeling, counterparty credit limits, master netting agreements and collateral posting to mitigate earnings volatility and credit exposure. The use of adjusted earnings, which exclude non-qualifying mark-to-market hedge impacts, provides a clearer view of fundamental performance and resilience by isolating the effects of market fluctuations. Investments in special-use funds for nuclear decommissioning and storm damage, allocated between liquid and longer-term securities, ensure the preservation of system integrity and funding for future obligations, while regulatory accounting for deferred assets and liabilities under cost-based rate regulation enables partial maintenance of performance under market and environmental perturbations, collectively reflecting NEE’s ability to reconfigure resources, adapt to sudden disruptions and sustain its operations and financial health in challenging conditions.

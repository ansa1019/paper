Boeing’s response to significant shocks—such as the COVID-19 pandemic, production issues on the 787 program and the 737 MAX grounding—has involved systematic monitoring of market demand, dynamic reconfiguration of production rates across its core businesses (Commercial Airplanes, Defense, Space & Security and Global Services), disciplined backlog and rate management, and targeted investments in process transformations to preserve liquidity, enable crisis response and maintain operational continuity; the company has resumed 737 MAX deliveries, engaged in extensive regulatory discussions to restart 787 deliveries and incurred reach-forward program losses to reflect revised cost and schedule estimates, all while collaborating with suppliers and financiers to secure alternative financing, monitor supply-chain health and adjust to external pressures from global trade disputes, sanctions and evolving government budgets; by leveraging substantial historical earnings and cash flow to invest in new products, services and business-process improvements, executing disciplined debt and capital management, making discretionary pension and postretirement contributions and adapting contractual and financing commitments, Boeing seeks to absorb strain, preserve or enhance functioning under adverse conditions and emerge stronger and more resilient when markets recover.

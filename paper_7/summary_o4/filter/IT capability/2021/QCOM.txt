During fiscal 2021, our QCT reportable segment’s results reflected a recovery from the negative impacts of COVID-19, driven by increased demand for 5G products and higher chipset shipments and revenue per chipset, while we entered into several, and expect to enter into additional, multi-year capacity purchase commitments with suppliers of our integrated circuit products in an effort to secure commitments for future supply and continue to realize benefits from rising market demand. We expect commercial 5G network deployments and device launches to continue and anticipate our research and development costs will increase, primarily due to higher investment in 5G and application processor technologies and other long-term initiatives, supported by our belief that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations and debt programs will satisfy our working and other capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. We have deployed strategic investments and acquisitions, including the acquisition of Nuvia’s in-process technologies for eventual integration into QCT products and the definitive agreement to acquire Veoneer to incorporate Arriver’s computer vision and driver assistance technologies into our Snapdragon automotive platform, and we continue to devote resources to working with and educating participants in the wireless industry and governments regarding the benefits of our licensing program. We manage legal and regulatory proceedings by recording our best estimate of probable losses, assess capacity constraints in the semiconductor industry, potential impacts of U.S./China trade relations and national security policies, and the ongoing uncertainties of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we retain flexibility to return capital to stockholders via share repurchases and dividends, thereby maintaining our ability to adapt, allocate resources, mitigate risks and sustain performance under challenging conditions.

During the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, Visa prioritized the safety of employees, clients and communities by implementing a phased approach to reopening offices, maintaining a remote workforce and remaining in close and regular contact with stakeholders to help navigate uncertainties and assess evolving impacts on operations and business continuity. The company continuously evaluates liquidity and capital requirements, leveraging cash, cash equivalents, high-quality investment securities, a $5.0 billion revolving credit facility and a $3.0 billion commercial paper program under rigorous treasury policies to ensure adequate resources for operating expenditures, payments settlement obligations, litigation settlements, capital investments and strategic initiatives. Visa’s liquidity strategy encompasses diversification of funding sources, investment of excess cash to meet working capital needs, active management of foreign currency exposures through hedging programs and a settlement guarantee framework that indemnifies against counterparty failures. The use of non-GAAP financial measures to exclude non-recurring items—such as gains and losses on equity investments, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related costs and deferred tax remeasurements—provides transparency into the underlying performance and resilience of the business. Through share repurchases, dividend programs and issuance of a green bond, along with strategic acquisitions of Tink and Currencycloud, the company reconfigures its resource deployment toward enhanced technological capabilities and sustainable growth. Capital expenditures remain focused on technology assets and network infrastructure to support digital solutions and operational flexibility. Concurrently, Visa adapts to changing tax regimes by remeasuring UK deferred tax liabilities and manages complex legal and regulatory proceedings under retrospective responsibility plans, reflecting an integrated approach to risk mitigation, strategic foresight, adaptive resource management and the maintenance of network integrity and performance under challenging and uncertain conditions.

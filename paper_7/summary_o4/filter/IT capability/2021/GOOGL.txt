Alphabet discloses that it continuously invests heavily in operating and capital expenditures—particularly in data center land and buildings, servers and network equipment—to support long-term business continuity and growth, adapts its depreciation policies by extending the useful lives of servers and network equipment effective 2021, and regularly evaluates its cash and capital structure, including a foreign exchange risk management program, to mitigate external pressures and ensure sufficient liquidity for at least the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. Management remains focused on expanding and evolving products and services to address shifting user behaviors, device and modality diversification and market maturation, thereby preserving revenue growth and technology relevance under adverse conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which initially depressed advertising revenues but was met with a gradual return of commercial search activity and sustained R&D and promotional investments. The company’s risk assessment and resilience strategies encompass fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates—partially offset by hedging activities—seasonality, regulatory changes, emerging market dynamics and credit deterioration, supported by an ongoing process of critical accounting estimates and operational reviews that reflect organizational learning, adaptive resource allocation and a systemic perspective on maintaining functional integrity and performance amid environmental perturbations, resource constraints and legal and regulatory challenges.

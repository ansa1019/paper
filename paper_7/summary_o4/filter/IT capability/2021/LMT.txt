Lockheed Martin reports that it operates in an environment characterized by complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures and, in response, has focused its strategy on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of delivery, and placing security capability quickly into customers’ hands at affordable prices; this includes disciplined affordability initiatives, extending its portfolio into adjacent markets, growing international sales, investing substantially in technical skills and innovative technologies, and pursuing selective acquisitions, divestitures, internal realignments, cooperative partnerships, joint ventures and equity investments to strengthen its ability to adapt and reconfigure resources to meet current and future customer needs.  During 2021, the Company absorbed the strains imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic—including increased costs, supplier‐delivery delays, travel and access restrictions, employee absences, remote work and fluctuating onsite attendance—by pausing and resuming workforce reintroductions, encouraging employee vaccinations and booster shots, closely tracking federal and DoD vaccine-mandate developments, and using accelerated progress payments and cash on hand to advance $2.2 billion in supplier payments, prioritizing small and COVID-impacted businesses, while monitoring risk and adapting its acceleration approach through year-end 2022.  In its F-35 program, Lockheed Martin tapered its production rate in 2020 in response to COVID-related delays, then improved output in 2021 and, in conjunction with the Joint Program Office, agreed on a production rebaseline to ensure predictability, stability and recovery of the pandemic-induced shortfall.  Across all long-term contracts, the Company continually identifies and monitors technical, schedule and cost risks, assesses their effects on estimates of total contract costs and transaction prices, adjusts profit-booking rates (“risk retirements”), and, when cost estimates exceed expected transaction prices, records full loss provisions in the period determined.  To manage financial and operational risk, Lockheed Martin employs hedging programs for foreign-currency and interest-rate exposures, maintains diversified credit relationships and access to credit markets, and uses derivative instruments solely for non-speculative risk mitigation.  Pension and postretirement benefit plans are managed through actuarial assumptions, plan‐asset return expectations and ERISA‐governed funding to maintain targeted funding levels, and include significant pension risk-transfer transactions—most notably, an August 3, 2021 group-annuity purchase transferring $4.9 billion of defined benefit obligations and plan assets to an insurance company—that reduce benefit‐obligation volatility and enhance operational continuity.  The Company also monitors and records environmental remediation liabilities and associated recoveries under U.S. government regulations, revises its estimates quarterly to reflect evolving remediation standards and potential chemical contaminant regulations, and allocates allowable remediation costs through contract pricing.  Collectively, these strategic initiatives, resource-allocation decisions, operational adjustments, risk-management processes and investment activities embody Lockheed Martin’s ability to preserve and improve its functioning under adversity, maintain system integrity and performance amid internal and external disturbances, and emerge stronger from disruptive conditions.

Stryker reports that the COVID-19 pandemic led to severe disruptions in the global and U.S. economies, prompting the company to implement adaptations in its manufacturing, supply chain and commercial operations—including travel bans, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns—as well as realign its reportable business segments, in order to maintain business continuity and absorb external pressures on elective medical procedures; despite the suspension of elective surgeries in early 2020 and renewed inflationary and absentee impacts from subsequent COVID-19 variants, partial recovery in elective procedures by mid-2021 and a disciplined ramp-up of research, development and engineering investments, combined with a capital allocation strategy prioritizing acquisitions (such as the completion of the Gauss Surgical acquisition and the proposed Vocera merger), dividends and targeted debt refinancing under a new $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, contributed to reported net sales growth of 19.2% and adjusted net earnings improvement, reflecting Stryker’s capacity to absorb strain and preserve performance under adverse conditions; the company further preserved organizational integrity and performance by leveraging strong investment-grade debt ratings, global cash management strategies, proactive risk mitigation through inventory step-ups, impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets, reserves for product recalls and legal contingencies and robust tax planning and financial policy frameworks, thereby demonstrating systemic resilience, resourcefulness, adaptability and the ability to emerge stronger from disruptive events.

Although the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact our operations and supply chain, we experienced limited disruptions in 2021, implementing safety measures to protect employees in the office and support those working remotely, closely monitoring our operations and public health measures introduced by governmental authorities, and despite persistent logistics and supply flow constraints, taking proactive steps to maintain a stable supply of materials to meet production requirements and deliver incremental output throughout the year.  We responded to strong customer demand by making strategic investments through long-term wafer purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements, including amendments to our wafer supply agreement with GlobalFoundries Inc. that secure minimum annual capacity allocations and agreed pricing at the 12 nm and 14 nm nodes through 2025 while preserving full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry.  Driven by robust financial results and growing cash flow generation, our board of directors approved in May 2021 a stock repurchase program of up to $4 billion, under which we repurchased 16.7 million shares for $1.8 billion, and we maintain $2.2 billion available for future repurchases.  We believe our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $3.6 billion at December 25, 2021, together with our revolving credit facility and operating cash flows, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures and purchase commitments over the next twelve months and beyond, and that we will be able to access the capital markets should additional funds be required.  In furtherance of our long-term strategic objectives and organizational transformation, we announced in October 2020 a definitive agreement to acquire Xilinx, Inc. in an all-stock transaction, expected to close in the first quarter of 2022, to strengthen our high-performance computing leadership position.

During fiscal 2021, despite the significant impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the business environment and clients, ADP prioritized associate safety and client needs, continued uninterrupted payroll and tax processing services, and introduced a return-to-workplace solution providing a comprehensive suite of tools to navigate evolving regulations. The company’s strong, cash-generative business model, evidenced by sufficient free cash flow to meet dividend and debt obligations, low capital intensity, and substantial liquidity sources—including cash, cash equivalents, long-term marketable securities, a $9.7 billion committed credit facility and short-term financing through commercial paper and reverse repurchase agreements—enables it to absorb downturns and preserve operational continuity. Investments in scalable cloud-based next-generation platforms, the ADP DataCloud and ADP Marketplace, along with targeted research and development and broad-based transformation initiatives to address excess capacity, support strategic agility and future orientation. ADP’s client funds investment strategy—laddering maturities to average through interest-rate cycles, enforcing credit quality and maturity limits, and impounding client funds in advance of payment obligations—alongside proactive risk assessment of natural disasters, cyber breaches, regulatory changes and foreign-currency fluctuations and the use of derivative instruments to manage interest-rate, credit and currency exposures, underscores a multifaceted approach to risk mitigation and resilience, preserving system integrity and performance under internal and external pressures.

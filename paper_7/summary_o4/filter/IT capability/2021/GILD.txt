In 2021, Gilead delivered strong financial performance and rapidly adapted to pandemic-related challenges by leveraging Veklury to mitigate COVID-19 impacts on its HIV and HCV franchises, maintaining underlying demand and preserving business continuity under adverse conditions. The company continued to allocate resources toward expanding and diversifying its commercial portfolio and clinical pipeline through investments in internal programs and strategic collaborations—including collaborations with Merck and Arcus—to reconstitute and reconfigure its innovation trajectory and resource-generation capacity. For 2022, Gilead’s strategic ambitions focus on sustainable value creation via scientific innovation, disciplined expense management, portfolio strategy and organizational culture evolution to enhance adaptability, operational flexibility and long-term viability. The firm actively manages risks and uncertainties—such as pandemic effects, regulatory approvals, market volatility, loss of exclusivity and foreign-exchange fluctuations—through hedging strategies, rigorous project prioritization in R&D by reassessing unmet needs and reallocating resources, and by maintaining robust capital resources supplemented by operating cash flows. Gilead’s financing decisions, including debt repayments, dividend policies, stock repurchase programs and prudent credit facilities, support financial resilience, while the company anticipates increased capital expenditures to expand infrastructure capabilities. Its critical accounting policies underscore ongoing evaluation of estimates and judgments to address evolving market and regulatory pressures, thereby preserving organizational integrity and performance under varying internal and external disturbances.

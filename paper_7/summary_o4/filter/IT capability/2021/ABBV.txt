AbbVie implemented an integration plan following the Allergan acquisition to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization and expects to realize approximately $2.5 billion of annual cost synergies in 2022 while managing severance, retention and other termination benefits and related integration expenses. In response to the COVID-19 public health crisis, AbbVie has prioritized employee safety by following state and local health guidance, implemented workplace safety measures, closely managed manufacturing and supply chain resources globally to help ensure uninterrupted patient access to medicines and monitored clinical trial sites locally to protect study participants and staff. The company continues to assess the uncertain impact of COVID-19 on new patient starts, supply chain disruptions and evolving mitigation measures, including variant emergence and vaccine deployment. AbbVieâ€™s strategic objectives include productivity initiatives in supply chain, efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative and general corporate expenses, and continued realization of expense synergies from the Allergan acquisition to expand operating margins. Research and innovation remain cornerstones of the business, with a diversified pipeline of approximately 90 compounds under development and collaborations that entail milestone payments signifying progression toward future cash flows, and multiple mid-stage programs anticipated to transition to late-stage development in the next twelve months. Revenue recognition and rebate accrual processes employ internal and external data to estimate distribution channel inventory levels and claims processing lag times, with regular monitoring and reserve adjustments in response to contractual, statutory and legislative changes. AbbVie actively monitors economic conditions, customer creditworthiness and government regulations, establishes allowances for credit losses, and may utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, supported by a $4 billion revolving credit facility and access to debt and commercial paper markets. Debt and contingent consideration liabilities are measured at fair value and revalued periodically using probability-weighted models, discount rates and market-based inputs, and interest rate swap agreements are employed to manage floating-rate exposure. Loss contingencies for litigation and other matters are recorded for probable losses at the best estimate and updated as new information becomes available. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets undergo annual or event-driven impairment assessments based on macroeconomic, industry and market conditions and projected cash flow assumptions. Collectively, these actions reflect the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, operational flexibility, risk mitigation, resource optimization and the ability to preserve or improve functioning despite internal and external disturbances.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have focused on maintaining a supply of our medicines; reducing the strain on the medical system; developing treatments for COVID-19; protecting the health, safety, and well-being of our employees; supporting our communities; and ensuring affordability of and access to our medicines, particularly insulin. As part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and at the request of the U.S. and international governments, we invested in large-scale manufacturing of COVID-19 antibodies at risk, in order to ensure rapid access to patients around the world. The focus of resources on COVID-19, widespread protective measures implemented to control the spread of COVID-19, and the resulting strain on global transportation, manufacturing, and labor markets have negatively impacted development, manufacturing, supply, distribution, and sales of our medicines. We also face risks and uncertainties related to our COVID-19 therapies, including heightened regulatory scrutiny of our manufacturing practices, quality assurance, and similar regulations, restrictions on administration that limit widespread and timely access to our therapies, and risks related to handling, return, and/or refund of product after delivery by us. The availability of superior or competitive therapies, including therapies that can be administered more easily, or preventative measures such as vaccines, coupled with the unpredictable nature of pandemics, have and could further negatively impact or eliminate demand for our COVID-19 therapies, and mutations or the spread of other variants of the coronavirus have in some cases impacted the effectiveness of our COVID-19 therapies and may further render our therapies more or less effective or ineffective. The strain on global transportation, logistics, and labor markets caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and an increase in overall demand in our industry for certain materials resulting in changed buying patterns and constrained supply have had, and may continue to have, a number of impacts on our business, including increased costs to provide a consistent supply of our medicines where they are needed and potential disruptions in the supply of our medications. We believe our available cash and cash equivalents, together with our ability to generate operating cash flow and our access to short-term and long-term borrowings, are sufficient to fund our existing and planned capital requirements, which include working capital requirements, capital expenditures, contributions to our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans, and potential business development activities. Our management continuously evaluates our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can adequately and efficiently finance our capital requirements. We plan to invest more than $1 billion over several years in a new facility in Concord, North Carolina to manufacture parenteral (injectable) products and devices and more than €400 million over several years in a new facility in Limerick, Ireland to expand our manufacturing network for biologic active ingredients. As of December 31, 2021, total debt was $16.88 billion, and we issued euro- and British pound-denominated notes to refinance higher-cost debt, prefund certain maturities, and support general corporate purposes, while maintaining $5.26 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $5 billion of which is available to support our commercial paper program. In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, currency values, and fair values of equity securities, and we seek to address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates, and we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance; as of December 31, 2021, substantially all of our total long-term debt carries interest at a fixed rate, and we have converted approximately 13 percent of our long-term fixed-rate notes to floating rates through the use of interest rate swaps. Our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro, Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan, and we may enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to reduce the effect of such fluctuations in accordance with our corporate risk-management policy, under which gains and losses on these contracts offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on existing assets and liabilities. We periodically analyze the fair values of outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts and equity investments and have determined that hypothetical changes in interest rates, exchange rates, or equity prices would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or financial position over a one-year period. We review the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible and goodwill assets, for potential impairment on a periodic basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate recoverability may be at risk, and we assess contingent consideration liabilities, litigation reserves, and other contingent liabilities—including environmental and self-insured litigation liabilities—using probability-based judgments to ensure our financial position remains robust under varying internal and external pressures. Our revenue recognition processes and accruals for sales returns, rebates, and discounts are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized, and we estimate rebates and discounts based on historical patterns, current contracts, and changes in sales trends to maintain accuracy under evolving conditions. We evaluate retirement benefit assumptions—such as discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, and retirement ages—annually to align our pension and retiree health benefit plans with market conditions and demographic trends. Collectively, these operational, financial, and risk-mitigation measures reflect our commitment to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning despite adversity, and maintain system integrity and performance under internal or external variations and disturbances.

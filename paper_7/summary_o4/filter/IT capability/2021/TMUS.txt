Throughout its MD&A, management underscores the company’s ability to maintain continuity and preserve functioning under adversity, as evidenced by its response to both the COVID-19 pandemic and a criminal cyberattack. In the face of the pandemic, the company implemented social distancing measures, incremental cleaning, employee testing and adjusted actions as needed to ensure continued operation of its retail stores and critical connectivity, consistent with its designation as a critical communications infrastructure provider. Following the August 2021 cyberattack, it immediately began a forensic investigation and engaged cybersecurity experts, promptly located and closed unauthorized access, quickly identified and notified impacted customers in line with state and federal requirements, reset customer PINs, coordinated with law enforcement, offered identity protection services, established long-term partnerships with industry-leading firms and created a cyber transformation office reporting to the CEO, reconfiguring resources to mitigate risk and support recovery. The integration of Sprint enhanced its spectrum portfolio, increased its customer base, altered its product mix and created opportunities for synergies, with initial operating cost increases expected to decrease as synergies are realized and redundancies in network, retail, IT and back-office operations are eliminated. Restructuring initiatives to date have included contract terminations, severance, store rationalization and network decommissioning to achieve cost efficiencies, with $12.0 billion of merger-related costs anticipated through fiscal 2023. The company’s liquidity management—drawing on cash flows, debt issuances, securitizations, vendor financing and a $5.5 billion revolving credit facility—combined with disciplined capital expenditures for 5G build-out and spectrum license acquisitions, demonstrates strategic resource allocation and operational flexibility that support ongoing performance under internal and external variations and disturbances.

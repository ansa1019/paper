Management’s discussion highlights the company’s responses to internal and external pressures as the COVID-19 pandemic “has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders,” during which “many of the company’s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, [were] temporarily closed at various times, and a significant number of the company’s employees [were] working remotely,” and the company “has reopened all of its retail stores and substantially all of its other facilities, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers,” while “continu[ing] to work on safely reopening the remainder of its facilities, subject to local rules and regulations.” It further notes that “during the fourth quarter of 2021, certain of the company’s component suppliers and logistical service providers experienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that affected sales worldwide” and that “similar disruptions could occur in the future,” with the ultimate impact “uncertain” and dependent on factors such as the “timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic,” “the emergence of new variants,” and “the development, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments,” all of which may materially affect the company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. To maintain operational continuity and preserve performance under challenging conditions, management affirms that “focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position,” that its “balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $172.6 billion as of September 25, 2021, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond,” and that “outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days,” while also managing legal contingencies and uncertain tax positions through recognition of liabilities when “probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable,” all of which reflect the company’s systemic efforts to absorb strain, adapt its resource deployment, mitigate risk and preserve integrity and performance despite adversity.

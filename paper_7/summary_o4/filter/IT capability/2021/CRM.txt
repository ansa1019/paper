In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated global economic uncertainty, we launched our “success from anywhere” initiative and leveraged flex team agreements to determine how, when, and where employees work, while using Slack as a digital headquarters to connect employees, share information and maintain operational continuity, and we anticipate further investments and redirection efforts—including position eliminations, incremental remote-work costs and real estate lease impairments—to adapt our workforce and facilities. We continue to reinvest a significant portion of income from operations in future periods to grow and innovate our business and service offerings and expand our leadership role in the cloud computing industry, driving innovation both organically and through strategic acquisitions such as Slack and Acumen, which contributed headcount increases of up to 43 percent since fiscal 2021 across our data centers, customer support, professional services, research and development, marketing and sales organizations to absorb higher demand, scale infrastructure, enhance security measures, facilitate customer adoption and maintain performance under heightened complexity, unpredictable sales cycles and expanding global operations exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, inflation, and geopolitical events. We actively manage customer attrition through diverse programs and initiatives—resulting in stable attrition rates of 7.0 to 7.5 percent—and track remaining performance obligations, which increased to $43.7 billion, as a measure of contracted future revenue. To support resilience, we maintain principal sources of liquidity—including $10.5 billion in cash, equivalents and marketable securities, $9.7 billion in accounts receivable, a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and $6.0 billion in operating cash flow—to fund working capital, capital expenditures, debt maintenance and potential future acquisitions, while managing leasing commitments of $5.8 billion for office space, data center facilities and IT equipment, and we believe these resources will be sufficient to meet our obligations and enable us to absorb external pressures, preserve integrity and performance, and emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

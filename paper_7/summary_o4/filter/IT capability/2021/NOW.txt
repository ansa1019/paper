In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued to focus on “maintaining business continuity, helping our employees, customers and communities, and preparing for the future and the long-term success of our business,” and we continue to monitor the actual and potential effects of the pandemic across our operations given their high uncertainty and unpredictability. Starting late 2021, many employees began to return to our offices for at least part of the week, and our return-to-work approach has been adapted across geographies based on appropriate health protocols; although the impact of these and future operational changes is uncertain, they have not affected and are not expected to affect our ability to maintain operations, including financial reporting systems, internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. The Now Platform enables customers to connect “systems, silos, departments and processes” with digital workflows, transforming manual and disconnected activities into integrated, automated operations that increase our customers’ resiliency and security and deliver additional value. To mitigate risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, we enter into derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities, thereby reducing—but not entirely eliminating—the impact of adverse currency movements. We have generated positive operating cash flows over the last ten years and, with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $4.9 billion as of December 31, 2021, anticipate these resources will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months; longer term, we expect to grow free cash flows to fund operations, capital expenditures to expand data center capacity and workforce, and strategic acquisitions to supplement our technology portfolio. Subscription services arrangements—principally non-cancelable with multi-year durations—have yielded a 98% renewal rate over the last three years, providing predictable contracted revenue recognized over the performance obligation term. We maintain non-cancelable purchase commitments and operating lease obligations to support our growth strategy, and if additional capital resources are required, we may pursue equity or debt financing to ensure the organization’s ability to absorb strain, preserve functioning and adapt to both nominal and extreme conditions.

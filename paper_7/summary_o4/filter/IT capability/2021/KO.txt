During the COVID-19 pandemic, management emphasized the importance of business continuity and adapting to the needs of customers, noting that “business continuity and adapting to the needs of our customers have been critical,” and describing the development of “systemwide knowledge-sharing routines and processes, which include the management of any supply chain challenges,” resulting in no material impact on the ability to manufacture or distribute products. The company’s priorities included ensuring the health and safety of employees; supporting and making a difference in the communities it serves; keeping its brands in supply; maintaining the quality and safety of its products; and serving customers across all channels as they “adapt to the shifting demands of consumers during the pandemic.” It further stated that, despite ongoing uncertainties, “we expect to continue to see improvements in our business as we continue to learn and adapt to the ever-changing environment.” To navigate the pandemic and position itself for growth, management identified key objectives—winning more consumers, gaining market share, maintaining strong system economics, strengthening stakeholder impact and “equipping the organization to win”—and focused on unlocking its portfolio potential, developing a robust innovation pipeline of scalable initiatives, increasing consumer-centric marketing effectiveness and efficiency, winning in the marketplace with aligned data-driven revenue growth management and execution capabilities, and further embedding ESG goals into operations. In August 2020, the company announced “strategic steps to transform our organizational structure” into “a networked global organization designed to combine the power of scale with the deep knowledge required to win locally,” thereby enhancing operational flexibility, resource allocation and the ability to preserve functioning under extreme conditions.

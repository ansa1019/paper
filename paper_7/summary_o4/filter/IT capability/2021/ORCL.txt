In response to the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company curtailed a number of variable expenditures across all lines of business, including employee travel and marketing expenses, and noted that these impacts on operating results may continue into fiscal 2022, reflecting its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity. To address evolving customer demand and enable customer choice under challenging conditions, Oracle introduced programs for customers to pivot their applications and infrastructure licenses and related support to Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate and expand existing workloads, thereby reconfiguring deployment trajectories and enhancing operational flexibility. Providing choice and flexibility to customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies are important elements of the company’s corporate strategy and future orientation toward positive adjustment under pressure. In fiscal 2022, the company expects to accelerate investments in its cloud and license business, anticipate capital expenditures to nearly double to expand data center capacity and geographic footprint to meet current and expected demand, and accept modestly lower operating margins as a trade-off for maintaining performance under extreme conditions. Oracle’s selective and active acquisition program, underpinned by internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or issuance of additional securities, serves as a mechanism for resource generation, reconstitution and competitive repositioning. The company believes that its working capital and liquidity position will be sufficient to meet its working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligations while supporting future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt, thereby preserving organizational strength and system resilience. The company continues to invest significantly in research and development as essential to maintaining its competitive position and performance under pressure, and leverages extensive experience, broad intellectual property and best practices to help customers maximize the performance of their Oracle applications and infrastructure investments. Concurrently, management executed restructuring plans to improve cost structure and operations, adapting headcount and re-allocating resources toward strategic initiatives and critical infrastructure, and noted that additional restructuring actions may be taken as necessary to improve operational efficiency. Cash collections from customers, including those previously delayed by pandemic effects, supported higher net cash provided by operating activities and reinforced the firm’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity. Also, the use of constant currency disclosures to assess underlying business performance excluding foreign exchange variability reflects a systemic perspective that maintains integrity and performance of financial reporting under internal and external variations.

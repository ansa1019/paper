The Company’s disclosures describe a range of actions, resources and controls that together support its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under adverse conditions. For example, the decrease in our inventory turnover ratio “was primarily driven by an increase in average inventory levels during fiscal 2021 to support the demand environment,” reflecting active management of merchandise inventories and working capital to meet fluctuating customer demand. We “generated $16.6 billion of cash flow from operations,” and we believe our “current cash position, cash flow generated from operations, funds available from our commercial paper programs, and access to the long-term debt capital markets should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to invest in the business through capital expenditures, fund dividend payments, fund any share repurchases, make any required debt payments, and satisfy other contractual obligations through the next several fiscal years,” while retaining the “ability to obtain alternative sources of financing, if necessary.” Our “disciplined approach to capital allocation” prioritizes strategic investments in the business and then the return of excess cash to shareholders, and we expressly reserve the right to “adjust our capital expenditures to support the operations of the business, to enhance long-term strategic positioning, or in response to the economic environment, as necessary or appropriate.” We further note that the “amount and continuation of our share repurchases will be influenced by the evolving economic environment and business conditions.” The Company evaluates its long-lived assets each quarter for “indicators of potential impairment,” projecting multi-year cash flows under varying economic and competitive assumptions and applying appropriate discount rates to ensure the carrying value of stores and distribution centers remains recoverable. Use of operating and finance leases to fund real estate, legally binding purchase obligations structured to support inventory, media and service needs, and a careful retail inventory method based on cost-to-retail ratios, markup, markdown and shrink estimates all reinforce operational flexibility and resource reconfiguration under internal and external pressures. Uncertain tax positions are recorded “only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will be sustained,” while business combinations are accounted for at fair value to enable rapid integration and reconfiguration post-acquisition. These measures collectively underpin the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, preserving system integrity and performance amid internal or external disturbances.

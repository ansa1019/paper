Throughout the reporting period, the company executed a customer-first, people-led, innovation-driven strategy within its “better not bigger” framework, focusing on enhancing capabilities such as speed and ease of access to services and utilizing technology and automation to deliver sustainable improvements to its network, illustrating resource allocation, service innovation and operational flexibility. The company’s disciplined capital allocation and balanced approach to dividend payments and share repurchases, along with periodic refinement of activity-based costing methods and an update to its cost allocation methodology for aircraft engine maintenance to better align expenses with utilization, demonstrate internal knowledge management, adaptation and reconfiguring of organizational practices. In response to the challenging economic environment marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chain disruptions, capacity constraints, rising inflation and wage pressures, the company monitored external pressures, anticipated continued demand for its services, adjusted network capacity, applied demand-related and fuel surcharges and maintained strong cash positions and access to liquidity programs to ensure business continuity and performance maintenance. Supply chain solutions operations saw margin improvements driven by strong demand in forwarding and healthcare logistics, including COVID-19 relief efforts, while the divestiture of UPS Freight and acquisition of Roadie reflect strategic reconfiguration of resources to optimize the capital structure and preserve functioning despite adversity. The use of non-GAAP financial measures to exclude short-term volatility from transformation activities, mark-to-market gains or losses and divestitures, and to provide a baseline for analyzing trends, underscores a systemic perspective on risk mitigation, organizational learning and resilience strategies. Anticipating persistence of external disruptions, the company projected capital expenditures of approximately $5.5 billion in 2022, primarily for expansion, aircraft replacement, technology initiatives and environmental sustainability projects, highlighting future orientation, resource generation and dynamic capabilities to absorb strain and preserve performance under challenging conditions.

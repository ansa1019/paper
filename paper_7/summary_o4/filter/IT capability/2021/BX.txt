In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Blackstone prioritized the safety and well-being of employees and their families and the seamless functioning of the firm for investors and shareholders by deploying a robust technology infrastructure to support remote work, implementing rigorous protocols—such as increased cadence of group calls and updates and frequent cross-level communications—and leveraging videoconference, teleconference and email to sustain team connectivity, productivity and culture; the firm’s investment committees continued to convene as needed, and its investment, asset management and corporate support functions remained fully operational, with return-to-office protocols developed and implemented in accordance with local government guidelines, including testing, contact tracing, social distancing and other safety measures, while continuously monitoring public health guidance and viral variants. Blackstone’s business continuity framework also encompasses active assessment of external pressures such as global supply chain disruptions and inflationary trends, judicious liquidity management drawing on annual cash flows, accumulated earnings, proceeds from debt issuances, liquid balance-sheet investments and a $2.25 billion committed revolving credit facility, and proactive capital deployment, all designed to preserve operational flexibility, mitigate risk, maintain performance under pressure and ensure resource availability in the face of volatility and uncertainty.

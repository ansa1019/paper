During 2021, the company navigated the continuously changing environment due to COVID-19 by adapting safety procedures and policies in line with CDC guidelines and refining its total safety culture, courage to care, commit, and peer-to-peer programs to reduce risk and eliminate incidents, while deploying proprietary physics engine software for proactive derailment prevention; it faced numerous operational challenges—including semiconductor shortages, intermodal congestion, winter storms, wildfires, bridge outages, mudslides, and hurricanes—and responded by adjusting transportation plans, maintaining higher short-term crew and locomotive resources to improve network fluidity, and planning to realign resources once service levels normalize; to strengthen system resilience, the company is making targeted capital investments to harden infrastructure, replace older assets, and improve the safety and resilience of its network, with a planned 10 percent increase in its 2022 capital plan—approximately $3.3 billion—for freight-car acquisitions, intermodal ramp enhancements, locomotive modernization, and other projects to enhance operational performance and efficiency; it continually evaluates its financial condition and liquidity across a range of economic scenarios to ensure sufficient borrowing capacity through free cash flow generation, revolving credit and receivables facilities, commercial paper, and capital markets access to sustain extended periods of lower volumes; market risks are managed through sensitivity analyses of interest-rate and tax-rate changes, debt covenant compliance, and a LIBOR transition framework; in December 2021 the company released an initial climate action plan that aligns operational efficiency, sustainable supply-chain solutions, decarbonization objectives, and stakeholder engagement to mitigate environmental perturbations; and third-party assessments of safety and operating programs are being implemented—augmented by predictive technology in the operating practices command center to reduce variability and mainline service interruptions—all of which support the organization’s ability to absorb strain, preserve performance, and adapt dynamically under adverse and exceptional conditions.

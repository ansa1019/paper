Arista Networks states that “our future success is dependent upon our ability to continue to evolve and adapt to our rapidly changing environment,” reflecting a commitment to maintaining performance under environmental perturbations by investing in research and development to enhance platform functionality, introduce new products and features, and leverage the programmability of EOS for rapid integration with third-party applications to achieve cost-effective solutions. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, management reports that “we are actively monitoring and evaluating developments” and “will continue to take further actions … to address COVID-19,” having prioritized employee protection through global office closures and implemented measures to sustain manufacturing and supply chain operations despite “significant constraints,” including “component shortages, increased supply chain costs and delays,” by “funding additional working capital and incremental purchase commitments.” To mitigate supply-chain risk, the company “increased our purchase commitments and expect to continue to invest in working capital to address delays in component sourcing and the risk of future COVID-19 related supply chain disruptions,” and during 2021 “cash provided by operating activities was $1.0 billion … partially offset by a net increase of $6.9 million in working capital requirements,” which primarily consisted of a $170.5 million increase in inventory to help mitigate the impact of supply constraints, largely offset by a $278.5 million increase in deferred revenue reflecting continued growth in post-contract support arrangements and product deferrals. The company emphasizes liquidity resilience, stating that “we believe that our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and our growth strategies for at least the next 12 months,” and underscores its marketable securities portfolio objectives of minimizing principal loss. Arista further discloses its practice of establishing non-cancellable, non-returnable purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of demand forecasts, recording corresponding liabilities and provisioning for excess or obsolete inventory, while acknowledging the “significant judgment” involved in demand forecasting under extended lead times and “regularly evaluating our exposure for inventory write-downs and adequacy of our contract manufacturer and supplier liabilities,” thereby demonstrating a systemic approach to risk mitigation, resource allocation, operational flexibility and business continuity planning intended to preserve or improve functioning amidst disruptions.

To sustain operations under adverse conditions, the Corporation regularly evaluates protocols and processes to execute its business continuity plans, maintains contingency funding and recovery plans designed to prepare in advance for potential economic or market stress, and manages global liquidity sources—cash on deposit, high‐quality unencumbered securities and borrowing capacity at the parent, bank and broker‐dealer entities—through diversified funding sources, including retail and wholesale deposits, secured financing agreements, credit card and mortgage securitizations, and short- and long-term unsecured debt issuances. A centralized funding and liquidity management approach enhances timely responses to liquidity events, while stress testing under baseline, adverse and tail-risk scenarios, integrated with strategic, financial and capital planning, ensures the Corporation can meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs without compromising customer support or capital adequacy. The Corporation’s comprehensive risk framework, governed by an articulated risk appetite statement approved by its Enterprise Risk Committee and Board, establishes clear ownership across three lines of defense and requires written enterprise policies for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. Credit risk is managed through rigorous underwriting standards, ongoing surveillance of borrower risk ratings and collateral, and quantitative models incorporating forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios to determine allowance for credit losses. Interest rate risk in the banking book is mitigated through forecasting net interest income under parallel and non-parallel rate shocks, using derivatives and asset-liability management strategies to balance cash flows and fair‐value exposures. Trading and valuation risks are controlled via daily oversight of position limits, value‐at‐risk, scenario analysis, broker and pricing‐service inputs, quarterly fair‐value hierarchy reviews and independent model validation. Capital resources are maintained well above regulatory and internal minimums through an internal capital adequacy assessment process, capital contingency planning, and stress forecasting, with regular reviews of stress capital buffers, supplementary leverage ratios, TLAC requirements and contingency options such as asset sales or capital issuances. Robust compliance, information security and operational risk programs—including ongoing testing, independent validation, incident response planning and resilience of critical systems—further reinforce the Corporation’s ability to absorb strain, adapt to changing conditions and preserve or improve functioning in the face of external disturbances.

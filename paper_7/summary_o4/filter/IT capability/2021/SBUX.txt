Starbucks’ fiscal 2021 disclosures highlight a range of organizational resilience measures, from strategic restructuring and resource reconfiguration to risk mitigation and liquidity management. Management realigned its reporting structure and completed a North America portfolio optimization plan, closing 807 underperforming stores and blending new store formats to better cater to changing customer tastes and preferences, while investing in wage increases and industry-leading benefits to attract and retain high-quality talent necessary for continued growth. The Company’s results “demonstrate the overall strength and resilience of our brand,” with consolidated revenues up 24 percent year-over-year “primarily due to business recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic,” and comparable store sales in North America and international markets rebounding significantly despite modified operating protocols and pandemic-related restrictions. Supply chain pressures, including shortages and transportation delays, are viewed as temporary and not materially impairing long-term growth or profitability under the “growth at scale” strategy focused on elevating customer experiences, enhancing digital capabilities and driving beverage innovation. To preserve operational flexibility under varying market conditions, the Company actively manages cash and investments—$6.9 billion at October 3, 2021—to fund operating needs, capital programs and shareholder returns, and maintains a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility and up to $3.0 billion in commercial paper capacity as backstop liquidity. Starbucks further deploys a market price risk management policy to quantify and mitigate commodity price, interest rate and foreign currency exposures through fixed-price contracts, price-to-be-fixed agreements and hedging instruments such as interest rate swaps, treasury locks, cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange debt, thereby enabling the organization to absorb strain, preserve performance and maintain continuity amid internal or external disturbances.

The company mobilized in early 2020 to support the COVID-19 pandemic response with products and services that help analyze, diagnose and protect from the virus, but as a result of the pandemic’s impact on various markets saw a significant reduction in customer activity in several businesses by late March 2020 that materially adversely affected primarily the analytical instruments segment; this negative impact significantly lessened in 2021, when the life sciences solutions and specialty diagnostics segments as well as the laboratory products business continued to support COVID-19 diagnostic testing, scaling and evolving their molecular diagnostics solutions and plastic consumables businesses to respond to the ongoing pandemic, while the biosciences and bioproduction businesses also expanded their capacity to meet the needs of pharma and biotech customers as they rapidly expanded their own production volumes to meet global vaccine manufacturing requirements and, through our pharma services business, provided our pharma and biotech customers with the services they needed to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally, resulting in sales of products related to COVID-19 response of $9.23 billion in 2021. Conditions were strong in each of the company’s end markets during 2021, with revenues driven by growth in COVID-19 testing-related products as the company continued to support the societal response to the pandemic, and the company continues to execute its proven growth strategy which consists of three pillars, including delivering a unique value proposition to our customers and leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets; strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, research and development projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience, as well as incentive compensation and recognition for employees. Productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its practical process improvement (PPI) business system including reduced costs resulting from implementing continuous improvement methodologies, global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. To mitigate risk and sustain business continuity, the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, and notable recent acquisitions, including those of a European viral vector manufacturing business, Mesa Biotech, a state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing facility in Lengnau, Switzerland, PPD, Inc., and PeproTech, Inc., have expanded the company’s capabilities for cell and gene vaccines and therapies, advanced molecular diagnostics at the point of care, clinical research services and bioscience offerings, demonstrating its ability to reconfigure resource deployment, adapt to external disturbances and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity.

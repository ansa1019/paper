Throughout 2021 and 2020, management emphasized the firm’s ability to maintain operations and support client activity under challenging market and pandemic-driven conditions by executing key strategic initiatives, enhancing online self-service capabilities, streamlining call-routing processes, increasing staffing, and progressing the integration of major acquisitions while targeting completion of client conversion within 30 to 36 months and realizing material cost synergies. Schwab’s enterprise risk management framework, approved by the board, integrates risk appetite statements and cross-functional governance—from the Global Risk Committee and its sub-committees through the board Risk Committee—to identify, assess, monitor, and mitigate operational, compliance, credit, market, and liquidity risks, employing periodic self-assessments, control testing, and internal audit reviews. To ensure business continuity and system resilience, Schwab maintains redundant backup and recovery infrastructure, regularly tests disaster recovery and incident management plans, and enforces a comprehensive information security program—including policies, monitoring tools, personnel training, and rapid response to suspicious activity—to protect critical functions and client data. The firm’s capital and liquidity management policies include regular liquidity and capital stress testing—covering net interest revenue simulations, economic value of equity scenarios, and 30-day liquidity coverage ratio requirements—capital contingency planning for low-probability, high-impact events, disciplined balance sheet management amid elevated client cash inflows, maintenance of diversified funding sources (including Federal Home Loan Bank facilities, secured lines of credit, and commercial paper programs), and internal limits to support continued funding of operations, ledger integrity, and regulatory compliance. These measures, together with structured processes for managing third-party, model, conduct, fiduciary, and incentive-compensation risk, reflect the company’s systemic approach to absorbing strain from external perturbations—whether regulatory changes, market volatility, or operational failures—and preserving or improving overall function, performance, and client service standards under both nominal and extreme conditions.

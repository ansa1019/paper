In fiscal 2021, Accenture observed that the COVID-19 pandemic presented significant operational challenges, yet demand rebounded strongly as clients accelerated digital transformation, enabling second-half revenue growth of 22% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency. To maintain operational flexibility and performance, the company proactively planned and managed workforce size and composition—growing headcount to approximately 624,000, raising utilization to 93%, adjusting compensation and pricing mix to balance margin pressures, and deploying employees globally to meet evolving client needs. Accenture leveraged hedging programs and currency-protection provisions to mitigate foreign exchange volatility and conducted continuous review of contract terms—monitoring incentive fees, penalties and non-cancelable commitments—to preserve revenue streams. Liquidity and funding resilience were achieved through robust operating cash flow generation of approximately $9.0 billion, diversified borrowing facilities and centralized cash reserves in jurisdictions without material distribution restrictions, while capital-allocation flexibility, including share repurchase plans, remained subject to market conditions and strategic imperatives. The firm’s reliance on judgments and estimates in revenue recognition, tax provisioning and booking measurements, coupled with ongoing evaluation of operating assets, liabilities and performance obligations, underscores its capacity to absorb strains, adapt operating strategies and preserve its functional integrity under adverse internal and external variations.

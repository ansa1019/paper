Management’s discussion highlights forward‐looking statements subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may continue to negatively impact revenue, gross margin and logistics costs, illustrating the company’s ongoing risk assessment and mitigation under challenging conditions. The company has built a strong global presence with core competencies in nanoscale applications enablement, chemistry, plasma and fluidics, advanced systems engineering and integrated hardware, materials, software and process control to help customers build smaller, faster and better performing devices, demonstrating resource integration, operational flexibility and competitive advantage. To sustain and enhance performance, the company continues to make significant R&D investments in leading‐edge deposition, etch, clean and other semiconductor processes, leverages cycles of learning from its broad installed base, collaborates with ecosystem partners and delivers multi‐product solutions designed to enhance the value of its offerings, reflecting a systemic perspective and focus on continuous adaptation and innovation. The maintenance of sufficient liquidity reserves—comprising cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash—and the deployment of strategic financing tools—such as a revolving credit facility with sustainability‐linked covenants, a backstopped commercial paper program, periodic debt redemptions and off‐balance sheet purchase obligations including a five‐year electrostatic chuck supply contract—support cash flow management, capital expenditures for global production footprint expansions and investments in R&D through periods of market volatility and industry inflections. Comprehensive asset management practices, including inventory valuation allowances, warranty provisions, goodwill and long‐lived asset impairment reviews, and detailed revenue recognition policies allocating transaction prices across multiple performance obligations, further exemplify the company’s structured processes to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning under internal and external disturbances and reconfigure its financial and operational structures to maintain integrity and performance despite adversity.

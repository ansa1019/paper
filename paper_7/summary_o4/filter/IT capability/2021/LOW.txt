During fiscal 2021, management maintained operational flexibility and business continuity by improving in-stock inventory levels and store layouts, enhancing service offerings and private-brand assortments, and expanding omnichannel fulfillment capabilities—converting three geographic areas to a market-based delivery model bypassing stores, providing real-time appliance-delivery tracking and broadening same-day and next-day fulfillment options—to absorb strain and preserve functioning under external pressures. Perpetual Productivity Improvement initiatives, including a new store inventory management system with real-time visibility and a simplified user interface on the sales floor, reconfigured operational processes to reduce non-productive hours, accelerate associate training and allow focus on customer service, thereby mitigating operational risk and improving responsiveness. Forward-looking strategic initiatives under the Total Home strategy leveraged an expanded supply-chain network to position in-stock inventory for peak selling seasons and will further enhance online assortment, user experience and fulfillment in 2022, demonstrating preparedness amid rising interest rates and inflation. Liquidity management combines operating cash flows of $10.1 billion with $1.1 billion of cash, $4.0 billion of undrawn revolving credit capacity and a commercial paper program to fund operations, support long-term growth initiatives, repay debt, pay dividends and execute share repurchases over the next twelve months. Capital allocation of $1.9 billion in 2021 and a forecast of $2.0 billion in 2022 is directed toward strategic investments, store improvements and expansion, underpinned by rigorous impairment reviews and self-insurance reserves. Quarterly impairment analyses employ income and market approaches—monitoring negative cash-flow trends, local market conditions and triggering events—to adjust the carrying amounts of underperforming locations, while actuarial estimates of claims frequency, severity and discount rates for self-insurance liabilities illustrate dynamic risk assessment and resource reconfiguration to foresee, confront and recover from disruptions.

Goldman Sachs maintains robust policies and procedures designed to preserve business continuity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including a formalized business continuity planning strategy managed by a central team, comprehensive liquidity and funding policies featuring pre-funding of potential cash and collateral needs through Global Core Liquid Assets, a contingency funding plan outlining risk-specific mitigants and escalation procedures, dynamic balance sheet management with scenario-based stress testing covering liquidity, capital and operational risks, and an enterprise risk management framework incorporating regular risk identification, limit setting, reporting, decision-making and firmwide stress testing to ensure the organization’s capacity to absorb strain and maintain operations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the firm safeguarded employees and maintained critical operations through enhanced remote work capabilities and resilient IT infrastructure. The firm implements annual capital planning and stress testing processes, allocates capital to business segments based on internal risk assessments, and employs a share repurchase program to sustain appropriate equity levels, while information and cyber security risk, third-party risk and resilience recovery plans support operational flexibility. Comprehensive model risk and credit risk governance, collateralized financing structures, counterparty credit support agreements, and internal control self-assessments further bolster Goldman Sachs’s ability to absorb shocks, reconfigure trajectories in response to external pressures, and maintain systemic integrity and performance under extreme or exceptional conditions.

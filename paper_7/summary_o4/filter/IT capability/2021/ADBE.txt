Adobe reports that it regularly evaluates its assumptions, judgments and estimates affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and discusses its critical accounting policies with its audit committee, acknowledging that unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions and estimates. The company’s focus on business continuity during the COVID-19 pandemic includes promoting employee health and safety, serving customers and carefully assessing and reassessing conditions on a case-by-case basis to determine when employees can safely return to offices or resume travel, while implementing a reimagined framework for the future of work rooted in a flexible hybrid “digital-first” model. Adobe’s subscription-based business model provides relatively predictable revenue streams that support operational continuity, and the ongoing shift to digital engagement has increased the importance and relevance of its offerings, driving continued growth despite macroeconomic uncertainty. To optimize customer journeys and support its recurring revenue model, Adobe employs a data-driven operating model (DDOM) and leverages its Experience Cloud solutions, while its $1 billion revolving credit agreement, foreign currency hedging program and professional investment management of cash and investments serve to safeguard financial resources and mitigate external pressures. Significant investments in research and development, including recruiting and hiring software developers, and capital expenditures for facilities expansion are deemed critical to remain competitive and enable timely development of new and enhanced offerings. Strategic acquisitions such as the purchases of Frame.io and Workfront, together with structured and accelerated share repurchase agreements, reflect resource deployment decisions designed to preserve organizational flexibility, maintain financial strength and return value to stockholders under varying market conditions. Adobe also maintains reserves for income taxes, recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent they are more likely than not to be realized based on available positive and negative evidence, and regularly assesses the likelihood and potential impact of tax examinations, while indemnification provisions and lease commitments further contribute to operational flexibility and risk mitigation. These combined actions support the preservation of performance and system integrity under internal and external variations and disruptions.

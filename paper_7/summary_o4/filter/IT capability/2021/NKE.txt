Throughout fiscal 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our business results and operations globally, as our business and wholesale partners experienced temporary store closures and reduced hours, and disruption in the global supply chain due to container shortages, transportation delays and U.S. port congestion; despite this disruption, we achieved record revenues for fiscal 2021, which increased 19% to $44.5 billion, with gross margin expansion of 140 basis points, and ended the fiscal year with inventories down 7% and a strong liquidity position of $13.5 billion of cash and equivalents and short-term investments. Our strategy to achieve long-term revenue growth is anchored in building deep personal consumer connections and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail, while since fiscal 2018 we have focused on doubling the impact of innovation, increasing our speed and agility to market and growing our direct connections with consumers. In June 2020, we announced “consumer direct acceleration,” a strategic phase that creates the marketplace of the future through premium, consistent and seamless consumer experiences aligned with consumer needs; aligns product creation and category organizations around a new consumer construct to simplify our offense and accelerate growth opportunities; and unifies investments in data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering, inventory management and other areas against an end-to-end technology foundation to accelerate our digital transformation. Management continues to monitor the rapidly evolving situation and may take additional actions based on public health guidance and external developments, acknowledging that COVID-19 could have material adverse impacts on future revenue growth, supply chain stability, inventory levels and profitability. We remain committed to effectively managing our business and mitigating financial market risks over the long term by executing against our operational strategies, leveraging our foreign exchange risk management program to lessen currency fluctuations through natural offsets and derivative instruments, maintaining committed credit facilities and a commercial paper program and prioritizing cash flow generation and working capital management. Our organizational realignment and operating model changes—resulting in a net reduction of the global workforce, pre-tax charges of $294 million and reinvestment of future wage-related savings—along with disciplined share repurchase funding from operating cash flows support our ability to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions and emerge stronger.

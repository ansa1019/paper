The discussion highlights Tesla’s efforts to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions by continuously monitoring macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible, optimize and evolve its business, and accurately project global demand and infrastructure requirements so as to deploy production, workforce and other resources accordingly. The Company’s production has been affected by industry-wide semiconductor and component shortages, requiring additional workaround manufacturing and production design solutions and underscoring its need for operational flexibility and resource reconfiguration. Tesla is focused on ramping existing and new factories to installed capacity, pioneering mass production methods for proprietary battery cells and its structural battery pack concept, and maintaining adequate battery cell supply despite global component constraints, labor shortages and external disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to support business continuity and strategic resilience, Tesla continues to ramp new products and manufacturing facilities across multiple continents, invest in research and development, expand delivery, servicing and charging infrastructure, and optimize its supercharger network for cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction. The Company’s self-funding model is supported by strong operating cash flow, working capital management that generates positive cash, and disciplined capital expenditures currently expected between $5.0 and $7.0 billion annually for the next two years, with the flexibility to slow or accelerate spending by operating segment as needed. Tesla also maintains $17.58 billion of cash and cash equivalents, unused committed credit facilities, and short-term marketable securities, and has invested in digital assets as a liquid alternative to cash, thereby enhancing its liquidity resilience and capacity to respond to future growth opportunities or unforeseen disturbances.

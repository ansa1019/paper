In 2021, Amgen advanced its innovative pipeline, launched new products, completed strategic acquisitions and licensing transactions to augment its research capabilities and continued providing uninterrupted global supplies of medicines through the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic. During 2021, while meeting pandemic-related challenges and heightened competition from biosimilars and generics, total product sales remained relatively flat as volume growth offset lower net selling prices. Operating cash flows of $9.3 billion supported ongoing investments in research and development, capital expenditures and strategic transactions, as well as shareholder distributions through dividends and $5.0 billion of stock repurchases, reflecting a disciplined approach to capital allocation and liquidity management. Amgen’s human capital resource management is directed at attracting, motivating, developing and retaining talent to tackle core enterprise objectives, and the company believes that a diverse and inclusive culture fosters innovation and enhances its ability to serve patients. The company’s long-standing environmental sustainability targets were met or exceeded in 2020 while revenues grew, production capacity expanded and geographic reach extended to approximately 100 countries. Amgen continues to monitor emerging COVID-19 variants, has implemented remote-working arrangements and risk-mitigation measures that preserved critical operations and ensured supply-chain continuity, and maintains that existing funds, cash generated from operations and financing facilities are adequate to satisfy working-capital, capital-expenditure and debt-service requirements as well as planned strategic initiatives. Interest-rate and cross-currency hedging programs, a $2.5 billion commercial paper program and a multi-year revolving credit facility further underpin its funding resilience. This integrated resource allocation, risk management and operational adaptability has enabled the company to maintain performance and integrity under challenging conditions.

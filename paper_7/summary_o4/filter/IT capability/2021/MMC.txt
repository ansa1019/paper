During 2021, the company’s businesses “have been resilient throughout the pandemic and demand for our advice and services remains strong as the global economic conditions continue to improve,” reflecting its capacity to maintain functioning under adverse conditions through guidelines balancing “remote and in-office environments” and safeguarding colleague well-being, even as “uncertainty remains in the economic outlook and the ultimate extent of the impact of COVID-19 to the company will depend on future developments that it is unable to predict.” Robust operating cash flows of $3.5 billion in 2021 and $3.4 billion in 2020 evidence sustained performance maintenance, while the company “has substantially integrated JLT into all of its business operations,” incurring $679 million of integration and restructuring costs—covering severance, real estate and technology rationalization, process management fees and legal entity rationalization—with a further $46 million expected in 2022 and at least $425 million of annualized savings realized, demonstrating reconfiguration and resource reallocation capabilities. Its risk and insurance services segment, which “includes risk management activities (risk advice, risk transfer and risk control and mitigation solutions),” alongside advanced reinsurance and capital strategies developed by Guy Carpenter, exemplifies adaptive risk mitigation mechanisms and strategic tools. Financial resilience is underpinned by an amended and restated $2.8 billion five-year revolving credit facility subject to coverage and leverage covenants, diversified debt issuances—including senior notes due 2031 and 2051—and disciplined repatriation and reinvestment practices, ensuring liquidity under environmental perturbations. Finally, targeted pension contributions of $35 million to U.S. plans and $95 million to non-U.S. plans, with further commitments in 2022, underscore the company’s investment in workforce stability and system integrity amid dynamic market conditions.

The Company continuously adapts its organizational structures, resources and processes to maintain performance under internal or external variations and disturbances. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, management adjusted business operations, implemented a site-specific approach to assess and permit employee access, monitored local trends and guidance for each location, and affirmed that its global supply chain—comprised of third-party and internal manufacturing and distribution networks—is stable and resilient, with the ability to establish supply chains for new products and adapt existing ones by adding formulations or increasing scale as needed. The Company closely monitors clinical, nonclinical and commercial data, frequently reevaluates product development programs in light of new scientific, business and regulatory insights, and dynamically reconfigures focus and priorities to balance risk and potential, thereby preserving continuity of its R&D and commercialization activities. It diversifies its pipeline and mitigates fragmentation and resource constraints by combining internal research efforts with external innovation collaborations, joint development and licensing arrangements, strategic equity investments and acquisitions, ensuring the absorption of strain and preservation of organizational integrity. Financially, the Company maintains substantial liquidity—managing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and revolving credit facilities—to fund ongoing operations and future capital requirements, including research, development, manufacturing and reimbursement initiatives, thereby enhancing operational flexibility and competitive advantage in a turbulent environment.

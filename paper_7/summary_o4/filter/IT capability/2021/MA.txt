Mastercard continues to monitor the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on business activity, adapting to changing conditions as governments, businesses and consumers tighten or loosen safety measures and making resource allocations that support business continuity. The company relies on existing liquidity, cash generated from operations and access to capital—including a committed unsecured $6 billion revolving credit facility and an authorized $6 billion commercial paper program—to fund global operations, manage credit and settlement exposure and provide liquidity in the event of settlement failures. Mastercard’s risk management practices include hedging anticipated foreign currency–denominated revenues through foreign exchange derivative contracts, designating certain contracts as cash flow hedges, and guaranteeing customer settlement obligations. In 2021, the company completed acquisitions and business combinations, allocated consideration to identifiable tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, and made strategic investments in personnel costs, advertising and data processing to support ongoing strategic initiatives and value-added services such as cyber and intelligence solutions. Regular review and estimation processes for customer rebates and incentives, litigation provisions and uncertain tax positions underscore the company’s systematic approach to assessing potential exposures, reconfiguring assumptions as actual performance and regulatory developments emerge, and preserving or improving functioning under internal and external variations. Together, these measures reflect Mastercard’s ability to absorb strain, maintain integrity and performance in turbulent markets, and adapt organizationally to uncertainty and evolving external pressures.

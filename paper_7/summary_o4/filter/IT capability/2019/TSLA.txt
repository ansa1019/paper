We continued enhancing the user experience through improved Autopilot and FSD features, including the introduction of a new powerful on-board FSD computer, a smart Summon feature and an expanded set of in-car entertainment options, demonstrating our competence in software development, connectivity and digital infrastructure deployment. We make our existing vehicles incrementally more compelling through planned over-the-air software updates for FSD-enabled vehicles to react to traffic lights, stop signs and navigate city intersections, and through additional functionality of both in-vehicle software and the Tesla mobile app, underscoring our ability to deploy and reconfigure IT resources in response to changing customer needs. Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to internet connectivity and access to our Supercharger network, which are provisioned upon vehicle delivery and recognized over time as a stand-ready service, while cost of automotive sales and leasing revenue encompasses allocations for vehicle connectivity costs and infrastructure related to our Supercharger network, reflecting the integration of IT capability across our assets and processes. In our solar operations, we revamped traditionally complex ordering, permitting, installation and back-end service processes to enhance the customer experience, and residential and small-scale commercial customers receive a proprietary monitoring system that captures and displays historical energy generation data, illustrating our information management capability in providing users with timely and reliable data. Monitoring service revenue is recognized ratably over the warranty period, demonstrating our deployment of digital technologies for remote system oversight. For large-scale commercial and utility-grade solar and energy storage contracts, we allocate transaction prices to multiple performance obligations based on standalone selling prices and recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion method, supported by internal systems that track project milestones and performance metrics. Our direct vehicle leasing programs and solar PPAs, accounted for under ASC 842, involve IT systems for lease accounting, deferred revenue management and amortization of initial direct costs such as referral fees and sales commissions. While not always labeled as such, our investments in process automation, networked manufacturing equipment, dynamic capital expenditure planning systems, and data analytics via proprietary software platforms and mobile applications reveal an underlying IT capability that mobilizes and leverages technology resources in combination with organizational and human resources to support our business transformation, operational efficiency and competitive positioning.

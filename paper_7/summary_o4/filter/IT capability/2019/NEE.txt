NEE’s management uses earnings adjusted for certain items, a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, analysis of performance, reporting of results to the board of directors and as an input in determining performance-based compensation, believing that adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of NEE’s fundamental earnings power; the exposure management committee receives periodic updates on market positions and related exposures, credit exposures and overall risk management activities, and NEE uses value-at-risk models and industry-standard valuation techniques—such as internally developed discounted cash flow models based on forward price curves derived from fuel prices, system heat rates and supply and demand forecasts—to measure and manage commodity price, interest rate and equity price risk; derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market and reported in income, with related physical asset positions managed through master netting agreements and credit enhancements including letters of credit, collateral and guarantees; allocations of interest expense, use of credit facilities and maintenance of funded debt to total capitalization ratios are monitored through integrated reporting processes; fair value measurements of energy contract derivatives, cost recovery clause instruments and interest rate and foreign currency swaps employ a combination of market and income approaches, reflecting the company’s ability to deploy and reconfigure resource-based models in support of its financial strategies; consolidated liquidity and capital resources are supported by systems that track cash flows from operations, borrowings, debt issuances, proceeds from differential membership interests and equity issuances, enabling timely funding of capital expenditures, acquisitions and decommissioning liabilities within regulated return frameworks.

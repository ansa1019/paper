The company describes the continued deployment and expansion of technology‐enabled processes and data‐driven practices, stating it will “continue using a multi-faceted approach to safety, utilizing technology, risk assessment, training and employee engagement, quality control, and targeted capital investments” and that an “operating practices command center” has been formed to diagnose mainline service interruptions and develop solutions, support employee adherence to policies and best practices, and, through “utiliz[ing] data to identify and mitigate risk; detect rail defects; improve or close crossings; and educate the public and law enforcement agencies,” enhance operational safety. Moreover, the implementation of “Unified Plan 2020” embodies a strategic focus on resource utilization, variability reduction and management structure realignment to improve reliability, flexibility and responsiveness to customer needs, underpinned by network analytics such as terminal dwell, freight car velocity, locomotive productivity and workforce productivity metrics, which are tracked and reported weekly to the STB and published online, further reflecting an information management capability. The capital investment plan includes a “technology and other” category (approximately $255 million in 2019) aimed at productivity and efficiency improvements, and the 2020 plan anticipates maintaining a significant share of investments in network infrastructure renewal and capacity enhancements, including locomotive modernization and freight car replacements, thereby supporting the firm’s digital infrastructure and process optimization initiatives.

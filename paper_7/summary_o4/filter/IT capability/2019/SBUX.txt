General and administrative expenses increased $300 million, primarily due to higher salaries and benefits related to digital platforms, technology infrastructure and innovations and the 2018 U.S. stock award granted in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, which was funded by savings from the Tax Act and vests over one year. We expect to use our available cash and investments—including additional potential future borrowings under our credit facilities, commercial paper program and debt issuances—to invest in our core businesses, including capital expenditures for new and existing stores and our supply chain and corporate facilities, new product innovations, related marketing support and partner and digital investments, thereby strengthening our ability to mobilize and deploy technology‐based resources in support of business strategies and work processes.

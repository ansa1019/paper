Qualcomm describes its IT capability through its organizational structure and segment operations, stating that it develops and commercializes foundational technologies and products used in mobile devices and other wireless products and derives revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing its intellectual property. According to the MD&A, QCT “develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software based on CDMA, OFDMA and other technologies” for use in smartphones, tablets, laptops, data modules, hand-held wireless computers, gaming devices, access points and routers, broadband gateway equipment, IoT devices and automotive telematics and infotainment systems, while QTL “grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio,” including patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture, sale and/or use of certain wireless products. The company further explains that substantially all of its engineering, research and development functions are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., that beginning in fiscal 2019 all research and development costs associated with 5G technologies were included in segment results and that certain early 5G R&D costs historically in the QCT segment were allocated to QTL, affecting segment earnings before taxes. Qualcomm notes ongoing investments to develop wireless baseband chipsets and converged computing/communications (Snapdragon) chipsets incorporating advancements in 4G and 5G, OFDM-based Wi-Fi, RF, connectivity, power management, graphics, audio and video codecs, multimedia, artificial intelligence and virtual/augmented reality, all of which contribute to the expansion of its intellectual property portfolio, and it is investing in targeted opportunities that leverage its existing technical and business expertise to deploy new business models and enter and/or expand into new industry segments such as automotive, computing, IoT and networking. The MD&A also highlights process and system changes, including the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance to estimate and recognize QTL royalties in the period in which associated sales occur, the management of accounts receivable and inventory levels, and strategic cost-plan actions across segments, underscoring the mobilization and deployment of technology-based resources in support of business strategies and operational efficiency.

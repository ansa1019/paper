In 2019, the company continued to scale its information technology capabilities through substantial investments in data center capacity and network infrastructure—reflected in $15.10 billion of net property and equipment purchases and anticipated capital expenditures of $17 billion to $19 billion in 2020—to support rapid user growth, increased engagement, and the delivery of new products and services. Cost of revenue was driven largely by the operation of data centers and technical infrastructure, including facility and server equipment depreciation, energy and bandwidth costs, and salaries and benefits for operations personnel, underscoring the coordination of IT assets and internal processes to enable service delivery. Research and development expenses grew 32 percent to $13.6 billion, driven by a 31 percent increase in engineering and technical headcount focused on building new products and improving existing ones, highlighting the firm’s competence in deploying IT resources in service of innovation and business process enhancement. Investments in community and product operations—including content review and security functions—further demonstrate the mobilization of IT and human resources to uphold privacy, safety, and security. The company’s measurement of user engagement relies on complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models to estimate daily and monthly active users across multiple platforms, reflecting robust information management capability in providing accurate, timely, and reliable metrics. Taken together, these organizational actions, resource allocations, and operational processes illustrate the firm’s ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources in support of its business strategies and work processes, thereby reinforcing its IT capability as a strategic resource for competitive advantage and business transformation.

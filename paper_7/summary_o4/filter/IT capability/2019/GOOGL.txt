Alphabet continues to invest heavily in information technology capability through significant research and development expenditures in strategic areas such as advertising, cloud, machine learning and search, and through growing capital expenditures in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology infrastructure, including servers and network equipment. These acquisitions and infrastructure investments enhance the breadth and depth of its offerings and expand its expertise in engineering and other functional areas. The firmâ€™s technical infrastructure is included within its Google segment, which encompasses Ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Play, Search and YouTube, and as user behavior evolves across diverse devices and modalities such as smartphones, wearables and smart home devices, Alphabet seeks to expand and evolve its products and services to serve changing business and user needs, generating revenues from mobile channels, cloud offerings and subscription-based services. Cost of revenues reflects expenses associated with data center and other operations, including bandwidth, energy, depreciation and related equipment costs, and research and development and general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and facilities-related costs for engineering, technical, finance, human resources and information technology personnel, as well as professional services fees for information technology consulting and outsourcing, while cash flow from operations is supported by advertising revenues from Google properties and network members and by licensing and service fees for Google Cloud offerings and subscription-based products.

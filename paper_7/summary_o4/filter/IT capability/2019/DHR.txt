Danaher’s management discussion highlights the strategic role of technology across its global operations, noting that its geographic and industry diversity, as well as the range of its products, software and services, help limit the impact of market dynamics and support business processes; the company identifies rapid technological development—particularly computing, automation, artificial intelligence, mobile connectivity, communications and digitization—in its served markets and accordingly is making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to address this rapid pace of change and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources in order to be responsive to customers worldwide and improve operational efficiency; for example, the GE Biopharma acquisition brings instruments, consumables and software that support research, discovery, process development and manufacturing workflows, while in its diagnostics segment the company offers analytical instruments, reagents, consumables, software and services to facilitate clinical and acute care workflows, and its environmental & applied solutions segment provides instrumentation, consumables, software, services and disinfection systems to analyze, treat and manage water quality as well as equipment, software and consumables for packaging design, quality management, printing, marking, coding and traceability applications; the discussion also references costs associated with activities within finance, tax, legal and information technology functions in connection with separations such as the Envista disposition; ongoing productivity improvement initiatives reflect enhanced data-driven processes and efficiency gains; and the company describes the use of information technology resources and systems—including derivative financial instruments like cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps—to manage foreign exchange and interest rate risk, underscoring the integration of IT infrastructure in supporting its financial activities and connecting its organization globally.

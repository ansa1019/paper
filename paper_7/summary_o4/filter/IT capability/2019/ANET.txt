Arista Networks pioneered software-driven, cognitive cloud networking for large-scale data center and campus environments, with cloud networking solutions consisting of our EOS network applications and Ethernet switching and routing platforms that deliver industry-leading performance, scalability, availability, programmability, automation and visibility. At the core of our cloud networking platform is EOS, purpose-built to be fully programmable, highly modular and reliable; the programmability of EOS has allowed us to create software applications addressing requirements such as workflow automation, network visibility and analytics and has enabled rapid integration with a wide range of third-party applications for virtualization, management, automation, orchestration and network services. As we have grown the functionality of our EOS software, expanded our product portfolio and increased our sales force, our revenue has grown rapidly, and our future success is dependent upon our ability to continue to develop market-leading products and features that address customer needs and to sell these products to new and existing customers. We intend to continue expanding our relationships with channel, technology and system-level partners to reach new end customers more effectively, increase sales to existing customers and provide services and support. In addition, we plan to continue investing in our research and development organization to enhance the functionality of our existing cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features, and build upon our technology leadership. Our development model focuses on new products based on our EOS software and enhancements to EOS, and we engineer our products to be agnostic to the underlying merchant silicon architecture so that we can combine our EOS software with merchant silicon into a family of switching and routing products, enabling us to concentrate our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage merchant silicon vendorsâ€™ investments to achieve cost-effective solutions. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, prototype expenses, third-party engineering and contractor support costs and an allocated portion of facility and IT costs, including depreciation, and our sales and marketing expenses likewise include an allocated portion of facility and IT costs, reflecting our continued investment in software development, technology infrastructure and support capabilities to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform and our global customer support organization.

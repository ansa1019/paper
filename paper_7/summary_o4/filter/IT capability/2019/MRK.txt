Merck’s Animal Health segment “offers an extensive suite of digitally connected identification, traceability and monitoring products,” reflecting the deployment of technology-enabled resources to enhance connectivity and monitoring across its value chain. Through its U.S. wholesaler distribution programs, the company obtains “visibility into inventory levels” by capturing data on “sales trends, inventory on-hand, on-order quantity and product returns,” thereby supporting accurate, timely and reliable information management and operational efficiency. The use of accounts receivable factoring agreements in certain countries, under which the company “factors $2.7 billion of accounts receivable” and “collects customer payments related to the factored receivables,” illustrates the coordination of financial processes and IT-supported transaction flows. These initiatives demonstrate Merck’s ability to acquire, deploy and reconfigure IT-based resources in combination with other organizational capabilities to support business strategies, supply chain coordination and financial activities in response to changing business needs.

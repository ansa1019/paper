The management’s discussion and analysis contains no explicit reference to information technology capability or digital infrastructure, yet it repeatedly describes complex organizational and operational processes—such as the segmentation of the firm into real estate, private equity, hedge fund solutions and credit businesses; the global coordination of assets under management and fee-earning assets under management; the systematic tracking of key operating metrics including distributable earnings, segment distributable earnings, fee-related earnings and adjusted EBITDA; quarterly financial reporting prepared in accordance with GAAP; the use of valuation methodologies for investment portfolios; the management of capital commitments and liquidity through revolving credit facilities and note issuances; and the monitoring of market conditions, investor inflows, performance allocations and capital calls—that implicitly rest on robust information management functions, data collection, aggregation and reporting processes, and integrated systems to support decision-making, performance measurement and risk oversight across its international operations.

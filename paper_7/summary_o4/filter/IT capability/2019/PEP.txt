In our 2019 multi-year productivity plan, we will “leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint.”  We continue to “transform our capabilities, cost and culture by leveraging scale and technology in global markets across our operations and winning locally,” including “developing and scaling core capabilities through technology” and “building differentiated talent and culture.”  In response to a rapidly changing retail landscape, we “monitor changes in the retail landscape and identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities, distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.”  Our integrated risk management framework also encompasses oversight of “key risks throughout the year, including risks related to cybersecurity,” reflecting the importance of information security and resilience in our enterprise processes.

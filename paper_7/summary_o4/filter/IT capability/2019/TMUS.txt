The company’s management discussion underscores its strategic investment in advanced information technology capabilities through significant network transformation and digital service deployment, including building upon its foundational 600 MHz spectrum to launch America’s first nationwide 5G network covering over 200 million people in more than 5,000 cities to deliver transformational broad, deep, and nationwide 5G service, accelerate innovation and enhance competition in wireless, video and broadband industries. In furtherance of its un-carrier strategy and business transformation, the company has continued network expansion and improvements—accelerating its 600 MHz build-out, deploying low-band spectrum and upgrading network infrastructure—while recognizing right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for cell site and co-location leases under the new lease accounting standard, and entering into reciprocal long-term spectrum lease agreements and vendor financing arrangements for network equipment and services to optimize resource allocation and operational flexibility. The introduction of digital platforms such as T-Vision Home, delivering a premium TV experience with HD and 4K channels, and T-Mobile Money, a no-fee, mobile-first checking account managed via smartphones, highlights the firm’s focus on information management capability—providing data and services to users with accuracy, timeliness, security, connectivity and responsiveness to changing business needs—while leveraging IT and organizational resources in combination with interfirm partnerships to support business strategies, enhance customer relationships, drive branded customer growth, improve churn metrics and increase service revenues.

Cisco designs and sells a broad range of technologies powering the internet, integrating intent-based networking, security, collaboration, applications and cloud solutions to provide a highly secure, intelligent platform that helps customers manage increasing numbers of users, devices and services and realize digital transformation. In fiscal 2019 the company continued to invest in research and development and contracted services to accelerate innovation across its portfolio, bringing infrastructure platforms, software and subscription offerings to market while realigning organizational resources—including the divestiture of its lower-margin SPVSS business—and redeploying IT-based competencies to support priority areas. Customers are seeking networks that deliver meaningful business value through automation, security and analytics across private, hybrid and multicloud environments, and Cisco’s strategic priorities focus on accelerating innovation, increasing network value, and transforming its business model toward software-defined, automated and intelligent platforms. The infrastructure platforms category, including switching, routing, wireless and data-center solutions such as Catalyst 9000 series, ACI, SD-WAN, HyperFlex and server products, and the applications category, encompassing collaboration, IoT and AppDynamics analytics software, experienced double-digit growth alongside 16% security revenue growth driven by identity and access, advanced threat and unified threat management offerings, including the Duo acquisition. Service revenue growth was underpinned by expanded software and solution support capabilities. Cisco also strategically realigned its supply chain and manufacturing operations, engaging contract manufacturers under long-term capacity commitments and applying value engineering to optimize component design, test and production processes, while its adoption of ASC 606 redefined its revenue recognition for complex software arrangements and drove a shift to software-as-a-service models with performance obligations aligned to usage-based, ratable recognition.

The management’s discussion and analysis, while not explicitly labeling any systems as “IT,” details a series of highly information‐intensive processes that implicitly rely on integrated technology resources and information management capabilities to support business strategies and internal controls.  Revenue recognition and sales reserve accruals are based on estimates derived from historical rebate payments, current contract terms, product mix analyses and forecasts, demonstrating the mobilization of data and analytics to tailor estimates in response to changing business needs.  Risk‐management practices employ derivative instruments—such as interest-rate swaps and foreign-currency forward and option contracts—under a corporate policy framework that establishes minimum and maximum hedge coverage, offsetting currency and interest rate fluctuations and requiring the coordination of real-time market data and modeling tools.  Asset valuation and impairment testing of long-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets use projected undiscounted and discounted cash flows, assumptions about technical success probabilities, revenue growth, discount rates and fair‐value measurements, reflecting the firm’s use of advanced forecasting, valuation models and data integration across acquisition, finance and accounting processes.  Defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans employ actuarial yield curves, expected return assumptions, demographic analyses and alternative asset valuations—inputs that depend on specialized actuarial software and information systems to ensure the accuracy, timeliness and reliability of financial projections and compliance with GAAP.  Tax provisions and uncertain tax‐position assessments rely on interpretation of complex laws, continuous monitoring of regulatory developments, and maintenance of detailed tax databases to recognize, measure and disclose uncertain tax benefits and related interest and penalties.  Collectively, these discussions underscore an organizational capability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure information‐based resources—ranging from data management and analytics platforms to forecasting, valuation and reporting systems—in support of strategic decision-making, operational efficiency, governance compliance and financial performance objectives.

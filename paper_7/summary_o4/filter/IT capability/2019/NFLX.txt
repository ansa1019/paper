In 2019, we continued to mobilize and deploy IT‐based resources in support of our global streaming service by building and expanding our proprietary Open Connect content delivery network and related infrastructure equipment, engaging technology personnel in the testing, maintenance and modification of our user interface, recommendation, merchandising and streaming delivery technology, and incurring third‐party cloud computing, computer hardware and software costs. Streaming delivery expenses include network equipment, payroll for technology personnel and all cloud computing charges necessary to efficiently stream high volumes of content over the internet. Technology and development expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for all technology personnel as well as costs associated with computer hardware and software used to improve our service offerings, and other purchase obligations encompass non‐cancelable commitments for streaming delivery and cloud computing services. Marketing expenses further reflect the use of digital advertising technologies to support promotional activities. These investments in IT infrastructure, personnel capability and digital technologies underscore our ability to coordinate our assets and internal processes, enhance connectivity and information management, and align technology deployment with our strategic business objectives.

Through our diversified businesses, we leverage core competencies in data analytics and health information, advanced technology and clinical expertise to support and enhance our business strategies and work processes; we work together with clinicians to leverage our data and analytics to provide the necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes for patients; this trend is creating needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our Optum business platform; our capital expenditures, including purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software, further reflect ongoing investments in digital infrastructure and IT resources intended to enhance our ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure technology and information management capabilities in support of operational efficiency, organizational goals and the transformation of the firm into a competitive force.

The company describes a range of systems and processes that, while not explicitly labeled as IT capability, implicitly depend on the firm’s ability to acquire, deploy and reconfigure information systems and data-management resources. These include rigorous monitoring of discovery, research and clinical trial results and frequent evaluation of programs “in light of new data and scientific, business and commercial insights” to balance risk and potential; tracking of payor mix, government rebates and refund liabilities under early access programs in France, where it “adjust[s] our estimated rebates based on new information” and “defer[s] a portion of the consideration received” when reimbursement limits apply, recognized under ASC 606; the use of a “probability weighted discounted cash flow method” and “multi-period excess earnings method” to value contingent consideration and in-process R&D assets in business combinations; implementation of compliance policies and systems across multiple jurisdictions subject to extensive and complex data protection, privacy, fraud, anti-kickback, false claims and anti-corruption laws; and ongoing maintenance and expansion of internal controls and analytic capabilities to manage revenue recognition, reimbursements, regulatory filings and financial reporting—all of which rely on coordinated information management, connectivity, security and process-automation resources to support business strategies, regulatory compliance, performance measurement and strategic decision-making.

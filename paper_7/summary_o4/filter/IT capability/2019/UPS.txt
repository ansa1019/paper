UPS discloses that growth in volume was enabled by its on-going investment in automated facilities and other transformation initiatives and that the company continues to deploy and utilize technology to increase package sorting and delivery productivity by reducing manual touchpoints. In October 2019 UPS refined the bond-matching approach used to determine the discount rate for its U.S. pension and postretirement plans by implementing advances in technology and modeling techniques. Capital spending on information technology increased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to continuing development of technology-enabled solutions and capitalized software projects, with information technology capital expenditures totaling $774 million, and other expenses include costs for technology equipment and software licenses. Business investments in healthcare quality assurance and technology also increased costs in the supply chain and freight operations. Additionally, beginning in 2017 UPS launched a multi-year investment program in its smart global logistics network impacting all asset categories, including significant investments in its digital infrastructure and facilities automation.

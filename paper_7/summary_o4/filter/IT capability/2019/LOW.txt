In 2019, we rolled out a customer-centric scheduling system that enables better department coverage and customer service while optimizing payroll use, added scheduling-effectiveness tools to measure schedule efficiency, and deployed new mobile devices with applications that enhance store associate productivity and allow them to spend more time interacting with customers; we also plan improvements to the lowes.com platform to create a true omni-channel ecosystem that more efficiently serves customers across channels, and our capital expenditures included investments in merchandising resets, facility repairs and replacements of IT and store equipment as part of strategic initiatives to enhance our ability to serve customers and drive improved performance.

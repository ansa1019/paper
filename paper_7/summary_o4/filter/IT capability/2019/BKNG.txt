The Company connects consumers with travel service providers through its online platforms and continually innovates to grow its business by providing a best-in-class user experience with intuitive, easy-to-use websites and mobile apps, sharing resources and technological innovations, co-developing new services and coordinating activities across brands to maximize scale and interdependency. As part of its long-term strategy, the Company is building a more integrated “connected trip” offering of multiple travel elements and is expanding merchant transaction processing on its Booking.com platform to facilitate secure and flexible payments, as well as increasing outsourced data center and cloud computing capacity, software license and system maintenance expenditures, payments to contractors and data communications expenses to support growth and geographic expansion. Headcount growth in information technology, customer service and other areas underpins its efforts to meet changing business needs, and cash invested in property and equipment reflects additional data center capacity and new offices to support transactions and business initiatives such as alternative accommodations, marketing, payments and in-destination experiences. The Company also relies heavily on performance marketing channels—search engine keyword purchases, meta-search referrals, affiliate programs and other performance-based incentives—to generate traffic and continually adjusts its marketing spend based on growth, profitability objectives and returns on investment, while acknowledging that shifts to mobile platforms, differences in consumer purchasing patterns on smaller screens and evolving distribution and search algorithms could limit advertising and distribution opportunities. Moreover, the Company invests in technology infrastructure, including call center systems, translation services and fraud prevention, and maintains a focus on the deployment and mobilization of technology resources to support expansion, operational flexibility and sustained market responsiveness amid intense competition, rapid technological developments and changing consumer behavior.

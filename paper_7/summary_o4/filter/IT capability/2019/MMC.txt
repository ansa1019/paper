The company’s operations emphasize the coordination of assets, internal processes and interfirm transactions through robust transactional and analytics capabilities, as evidenced by its global delivery of analysis, advice and transactional services in risk, strategy and people. In support of these capabilities, the company invested $421 million in computer equipment and capitalized software development costs in 2019 (and $314 million in 2018), reflecting ongoing deployment and enhancement of information systems infrastructure and support for business strategies and work processes. During the integration and restructuring of the JLT acquisition, technology‐related costs—including systems integration, technology consulting and implementation fees—were incurred to rationalize infrastructure, streamline processes and align IT architecture across the combined businesses. Within the risk and insurance services segment, the provision of consulting and analytics services and catastrophe and financial modeling underscores the firm’s leverage of data management, financial modeling and analytical technology resources to deliver timely, accurate and reliable insights. Transactional capabilities and fiduciary fund administration further demonstrate the importance of secure, connected and configurable information management systems to support client transactions, risk management solutions and interfirm relationships, reinforcing the firm’s competence in mobilizing IT resources alongside human, process and governance capabilities to drive operational efficiency, adaptability and competitive advantage.

Our management highlights that we have pioneered a next-generation security platform delivered as software or SaaS subscriptions that employs an innovative traffic classification engine to identify network traffic by application, user, and content and provides consistent security across the network, endpoint, and cloud to safely enable transformative digital initiatives such as public cloud and mobility while maintaining visibility and control over data and critical systems. We believe the architecture of our platform offers superior performance and reduces total cost of ownership by simplifying security operations and infrastructure and eliminating the need for multiple stand-alone hardware and software security products. Growth of our business and our short-term and long-term success are dependent upon our ability to extend our technology leadership, grow our base of end-customers, expand deployment of our platform and support offerings within existing end-customers, and focus on end-customer satisfaction. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. We continue to invest in innovation to evolve and further extend the capabilities of our platform, exemplified by our acquisition of RedLock to expand public cloud security analytics technology; the introduction of PAN-OS 9.0 with over 60 new features and a new DNS security service using machine learning; the launch of Cortex XDR for integrated detection, investigation, and response; and the acquisitions of Demisto, PureSec, and Twistlock to add SOAR functionality, serverless application protection, and container security to our Prisma Cloud security strategy. As adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings grows, cost of subscription and support revenue has increased due to data center and cloud hosting costs to support such offerings and costs to expand our customer service capabilities, and our consolidated results reflect allocated information technology costs within cost of revenue and operating expenses. We rely on our EMS provider to procure components and assemble our products based on demand forecasts—a process that underscores the coordination of technology resources, internal processes, and interfirm transactions required to support our business model—and we monitor key metrics such as billings and cash flow provided by operating activities to evaluate the performance of our hybrid SaaS revenue model and to guide investments in our IT and administrative infrastructure.

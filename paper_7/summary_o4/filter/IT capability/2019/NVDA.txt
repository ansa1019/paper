NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems and, starting with a focus on PC graphics, extended its capabilities to the revolutionary field of AI by leveraging its GPU architecture to create platforms for virtual reality, high-performance computing and artificial intelligence. Its two reportable segments—GPU and Tegra processor—are based on a single underlying graphics architecture from which NVIDIA has developed platforms serving gaming, professional visualization, data center and automotive markets. The Tegra brand incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, cars, game consoles and mobile devices. In the data center, NVIDIA introduced the CUDA-X AI platform for accelerating data science, announced the availability of T4 Tensor Core GPUs through leading OEMs and cloud service providers, unveiled the DGX SuperPOD, added support for ARM CPUs to enable AI-enabled exascale supercomputers and collaborated on a reference design for GPU-accelerated ARM servers. NVIDIA launched the EGX intelligent edge computing platform to bring accelerated AI to vertical industries and collaborated to integrate Microsoft Azure with EGX, planning a scalable GPU-accelerated supercomputer in the Azure cloud. Additionally, NVIDIA entered the 5G telecom market by enabling telcos to build efficient, virtualized 5G RANs, delivering software-defined 5G RAN solutions, and noted that Alibaba’s and Baidu’s recommendation engines run on NVIDIA AI. Research and development expenses increased by 19% in fiscal 2020, driven primarily by employee additions, increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including infrastructure costs and stock-based compensation, while sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 10%, similarly reflecting employee additions and infrastructure costs. As a fabless semiconductor company, NVIDIA makes inventory purchase commitments based on forecasts of future customer demand, accounting for third-party manufacturers’ lead times and market factors such as competitive pricing actions, new product transitions and macroeconomic conditions. In January 2020, the novel coronavirus outbreak led to manufacturing and commerce shutdowns in China and other regions, affecting operations, customers and suppliers and creating uncertainty around the company’s ability to coordinate its global supply chain and technology deployment.

Our strategic priorities emphasize the development and deployment of digital and data‐driven resources to support business strategies and work processes, including “winning in the marketplace with aligned data‐driven revenue growth management and execution capabilities,” the cultivation of a “robust innovation pipeline focusing on scalable initiatives,” and “continuously strengthening our capabilities in marketing and innovation to compete in a digital environment and maintain brand loyalty and market share.” In response to shifts in consumer shopping habits, we are “increasing our investments in e-commerce to support retail and meal delivery services,” offering “more package sizes that are fit-for-purpose for online sales” and “shifting more consumer and trade promotions to digital,” while also providing “easy-to-access information about our beverages on our website.” Our organizational structure further reflects this focus through the inclusion of a “platform services organization” alongside our corporate center, underscoring our commitment to mobilizing and integrating technology, data management, and digital platforms to enhance operational flexibility, connectivity, market responsiveness, and competitive advantage.

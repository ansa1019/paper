Danaher’s management acknowledges that its highly competitive, global business environment is characterized by “rapid technological development (particularly with respect to computing, automation, artificial intelligence, mobile connectivity, communications and digitization) in most of the company’s served markets,” and the company is “making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions and investments, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources (particularly in high-growth markets) in order to be responsive to the company’s customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the company’s operations.”  Capital expenditures, which totaled $1.4 billion in 2023 and are expected to remain at similar levels, are directed not only toward increasing manufacturing capacity and supporting new product development initiatives but also toward “improving information technology systems,” reflecting the firm’s focus on enhancing its digital infrastructure, process optimization and operational flexibility.  These ongoing technology-related investments underscore Danaher’s intent to acquire, deploy and integrate IT-based resources in conjunction with its broader organizational assets to support business strategies, streamline internal processes and reinforce its ability to compete and innovate across diverse markets.

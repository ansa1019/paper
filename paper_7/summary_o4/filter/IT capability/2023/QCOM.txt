Our operations encompass the development and commercialization of foundational technologies for mobile and wireless products and include a cloud computing processing initiative formerly focused on AI inference processing, reflecting ongoing investments in digital infrastructure and technology deployment; we derive revenues from integrated circuit products and licensing our intellectual property portfolios, which requires estimating and recognizing sales-based royalties based on licensee-provided data, underscoring our information management capability for data accuracy, timeliness and reliability; research and development expenses increased in fiscal 2023 driven by higher costs related to the development of wireless and integrated circuit technologies (including 5G and application processor technologies), demonstrating our commitment to advancing technology functionalities and IT investment; we monitor our marketable equity and strategic investments for impairment indicators by evaluating financial and liquidity positions, business forecasts, industry acceptance of technologies and macroeconomic factors, exemplifying our monitoring systems and management skills; inventory is managed at the lower of cost or net realizable value based on future customer demand estimates and market conditions, illustrating supply chain coordination and process optimization; in light of macroeconomic weakness and demand uncertainty, we initiated restructuring actions to realign organizational resources and internal processes in support of key growth and diversification initiatives; our strategic investments segment records net gains or losses on marketable securities and other investments, reflecting resource allocation decisions within our technology portfolio; we maintain liquidity through cash generated from operations, unsecured debt programs and marketable securities to fund capital expenditures, multi-year capacity commitments and research and development efforts that underpin our IT infrastructure capability; and we continue to devote resources to working with industry participants and governmental bodies to promote our licensing programs and extensive technology investments, reinforcing our strategic resource allocation, organizational integration and competitive positioning in the evolving digital ecosystem.

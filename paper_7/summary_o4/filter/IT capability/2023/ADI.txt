The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points—including the technical characteristics of the product, “sold to” customer information, “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated—and, as data systems for capturing and tracking this data and our methodology evolve and improve, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. We recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of promised products after satisfying criteria that include identification of performance obligations, determination and allocation of the transaction price, and satisfaction of internal controls and data requirements necessary to reflect the consideration we expect to receive. Revenue from contracts with the U.S. government and certain commercial customers is recorded over time using units delivered or costs incurred as a measurement basis, which requires estimates of costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedules. Our sales contracts provide certain distributors with credits for price protection and rights of return, resulting in variable consideration measured through management’s estimates based on historical experience rates, contractual terms and assumptions about future economic conditions, supported by controls over the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. We review property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying values may not be recoverable, comparing carrying values to estimated future undiscounted cash flows and fair values determined by quoted market prices or discounted cash flow techniques. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators exist, using qualitative assessments of factors such as prior quantitative fair value margins, current forecasts, industry information and weighted-average cost of capital rates, or, as necessary, quantitative tests that compare fair values—determined under income and market approaches—to carrying amounts. Under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, we recognize tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values and record contingent consideration at fair value, requiring significant judgments about future cash flows, discount rates and likelihood of achievement of defined milestones. Income tax provisions are calculated using estimates and judgments for credits, benefits, deductions and deferred tax assets and liabilities, including “more likely than not” assessments of uncertain tax positions and quarterly reevaluations based on changes in facts, tax law and audit outcomes. Stock-based compensation expense is determined using grant-date fair value models that incorporate Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the probability of satisfying market and performance conditions and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds held by our foreign subsidiaries and the cost-effectiveness of accessing those funds, maintain cash and highly liquid investments with short maturities, monitor credit exposure to counterparties with high credit ratings and diversify investments to minimize credit risk, and perform sensitivity analyses on our investment portfolio, interest rate swaps and forward currency exchange contracts to assess the impact of hypothetical shifts in market rates on fair values. Capital expenditures of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2023 were made to enhance our global resiliency, with projected fiscal 2024 investments of $600 million to $800 million funded by cash on hand and anticipated financing, reflecting our strategic focus on infrastructure capability and operational flexibility.

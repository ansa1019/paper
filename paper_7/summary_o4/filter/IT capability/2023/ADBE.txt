Our discussion of subscription revenue notes that cost of subscription revenue “consists of third-party hosting services and data center costs, including expenses related to operating our network infrastructure,” and “compensation costs associated with network operations, implementation, account management and technical support personnel, royalty fees, software costs and amortization of certain intangible assets,” reflecting the deployment and combination of IT resources to support business strategies and processes. Research and development expenses “consist primarily of compensation and contracted costs associated with software development, third-party hosting services and data center costs, related facilities costs and expenses associated with computer equipment and software used in development activities,” and we emphasize that “investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced offerings and solutions.” In describing our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, we explain that we provide a “complete end-to-end creative design or document workflow solution that operates seamlessly across multiple devices and teams” by integrating “cloud-based and on-premise/on-device features that, together through their integration, provide functionalities, utility and workflow efficiencies,” including “creative cloud libraries,” “shared reviews,” “automatic cloud rendering of a design” and “Sensei, Adobe’s cloud-hosted artificial intelligence and machine learning framework,” underscoring our IT architecture’s competence to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure technology, knowledge and processes to deliver accurate, timely, reliable, secure, connected and accessible information. We also note that our investing activities include “purchases of computer and server hardware to operate our network infrastructure,” and we expect to continue investments in both “short-term and long-term investments” as well as “computer and server hardware to operate our network infrastructure,” which support our ongoing capability to tailor information management and technology resources in response to changing business needs.

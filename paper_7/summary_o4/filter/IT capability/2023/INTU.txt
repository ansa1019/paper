Management highlights that artificial intelligence is transforming multiple industries, including financial technology, as disruptive start-ups, emerging ecosystems and mega-platforms harness new digital technologies to create personalized experiences, deliver data-driven insights and increase speed of service, thereby fostering a more dynamic and highly competitive environment as services become digitized; the Companyâ€™s growth strategy depends on its ability to initiate and embrace these disruptive technology trends, enter new markets and drive broad adoption of its products and services, which has led to significant investments of management attention and resources in its information technology infrastructure and in its privacy and security capabilities. As the Company offers more online services, the ongoing operation and availability of its platforms and systems and those of its external service providers has become increasingly important, particularly given the risks associated with hosting, collection, use and retention of personal customer information and data; to address these risks, the Company has implemented additional security measures, achieved ISO 27001 certification for a portion of its systems and continues to work with industry and government partners on industry-wide security and anti-fraud measures.

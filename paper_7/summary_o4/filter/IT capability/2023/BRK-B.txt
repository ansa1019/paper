Through its subsidiaries, Berkshire Hathaway engages in a broad array of diverse business activities managed on an unusually decentralized basis, with few centralized or integrated business functions, while senior corporate management remains ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of operating business chief executives, reflecting its institutional governance and resource coordination processes. In its insurance operations, Geico markets policies predominantly by direct response methods—where most customers apply for coverage directly via the internet or by telephone—and operates an insurance agency offering homeowners and renters coverage to auto policyholders, underscoring its deployment of digital connectivity and customer-facing platforms. Likewise, in aviation services, NetJets and FlightSafety deliver shared aircraft ownership programs and high-technology training products and services to aircraft operators, illustrating the integration of digital technologies in program management and instructional delivery.

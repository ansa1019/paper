In our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we highlight our strategic investments in digital technologies and information management capabilities by disclosing increased research and development spending—up $894 million in 2023—to support pre-production phases for Cybertruck, AI and other software programs, and by detailing capital expenditures to expand digital infrastructure such as autonomy and AI-enabled products, supercharger network deployments and global factory systems. We explicitly include in automotive sales revenue access to our full self-driving (“FSD”) capability features, internet connectivity, free supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates, with related vehicle connectivity and FSD ongoing maintenance costs recognized in cost of sales and provisioned upon control transfer as stand-ready obligations over the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Our selling, general and administrative expenses reflect personnel and facilities costs related to our information technology organization, and our cost of automotive sales revenue further incorporates allocations for tooling and machinery depreciation, logistics, connectivity costs and ongoing software maintenance. These disclosures demonstrate our ability to mobilize, deploy and leverage IT resources—ranging from software development and over-the-air update functionality to network and automation infrastructure—in combination with our manufacturing, service and financing processes to enhance operational efficiency, customer value and competitive advantage.

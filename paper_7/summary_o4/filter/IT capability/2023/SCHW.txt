The Charles Schwab Corporation’s 2023 disclosures describe significant investments in information technology capabilities to coordinate internal processes, support interfirm integration, and enhance operational flexibility and capacity.  During the year, Schwab incurred $804 million of capital expenditures—comprising capitalized software development, information technology and telecommunications equipment, and facilities—to strengthen its technological infrastructure for the TD Ameritrade integration and accommodate growth in its 34.8 million active brokerage accounts.  Depreciation and amortization expense rose as a result of higher amortization of purchased and internally developed software and increased depreciation of hardware, while occupancy and equipment expenses reflected expanded software maintenance agreements and technology equipment costs, including $17 million of restructuring‐related charges.  The company also engaged professional services to accelerate technology enhancements and platform consolidation, transitioning approximately $1.6 trillion of client assets across more than 15 million accounts onto the Schwab platform.  To ensure resilience and information reliability, Schwab maintains a comprehensive backup and recovery infrastructure—featuring redundant facilities, secure communications, a geographically dispersed workforce, and routine business continuity and disaster‐recovery testing—underscoring its competence in mobilizing and deploying IT‐based resources in support of strategic objectives.

Since 2008, we have invested $12.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, including the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities in pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies; in November 2022, we acquired Swedish Match AB to create a global smoke-free combination led by the IQOS and ZYN brands, leveraging complementary product portfolios and interfirm transactions to accelerate our smoke-free ambitions; in January 2023, we began managing our business in four geographical segments (down from six) and, following progress toward integrating the Swedish Match business, will update our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2024 to reflect evolving management processes and information structures; our net revenues and operating income are affected by the volume of products we sell, the price of our products, changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell—where “mix” refers to both the proportionate value of premium-price brands to mid-price or low-price brands and the proportion of shipment volume in more profitable versus less profitable markets—highlighting our use of data-driven performance metrics and strategic resource allocation; our cost of sales and marketing, administration and research functions include costs incurred to develop new products, underscoring investment decisions to support business strategies; in Ukraine, where safety allows, we continue commercial activities, supply the market through contract manufacturing arrangements and announced a $30 million investment in a new production facility in the Lviv region with preparatory work commenced in July 2023 and production expected in the first quarter of 2024, demonstrating operational flexibility and resource mobilization under environmental and regulatory constraints; and in Russia, we continuously assess the evolving situation, including regulatory constraints and restrictions arising from international regulations, recognize that any divestment transaction would be subject to complex approval terms and potential impairment, and manage our 23 percent equity interest in Megapolis Distribution BV accordingly.

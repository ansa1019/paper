The Company’s risk‐factor disclosures identify the ability of its technology resources—including information systems and security—to perform as anticipated, such as preventing material IT failures or third‐party infiltrations or hacking, and its capacity to increase use of data analytics and technology as part of its business strategy and adapt to new technologies as critical to operations. The MD&A also cites the effects of data privacy or cyber laws or regulation as a significant risk. In the cyber insurance segment, management observes that, although cyber risk does not represent a material component of net premiums written, the Company remains exposed to potentially material losses in the event of a systemic cyber‐attack.

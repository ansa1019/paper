Management’s discussion cross‐references consolidated financial statements and SEC filings accessed via the corporate website and employs graph‐based year-over-year trend analyses to provide timely and reliable performance insights; it evaluates operating performance using non-GAAP measures such as net operating income by real estate and strategic capital segments, which are calculated by aggregating and reconciling revenues and expenses, allocating property management and leasing costs based on square footage, and adjusting for straight-line rent, fair value lease modifications, foreign currency translation, and third-party venture ownership; it further conducts “same store” analyses that isolate period-to-period property NOI by removing one-time items and standardizing currency effects; it tracks development pipelines—including square footage, lease percentages, estimated value at completion, and remaining investment requirements—and monitors liquidity through available borrowing capacity on global credit facilities, debt maturities and weighted average interest rates; and it summarizes cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, including contributions to and distributions from unconsolidated co-investment ventures, debt issuances, repayments and settlements of net investment hedges, all of which reflect the firm’s information management capability to aggregate, tailor and deploy data and financial metrics in support of strategic resource allocation, investment decisions, risk management and global operational oversight.

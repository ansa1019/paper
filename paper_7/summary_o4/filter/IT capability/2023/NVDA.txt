Nvidia pioneered accelerated computing and has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for accelerated computing, AI solutions, scientific computing, data science, autonomous vehicles, robotics, metaverse and 3D internet applications, with its platforms incorporating processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems and services to deliver unique value. Demand for our data center systems and products surged in fiscal year 2024, and entering fiscal year 2025 we are gathering customer demand indications across several product transitions, with demand visibility for our new data center products ramping later in the year. We have increased our supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements, noting that these increased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk. Product transitions are complex as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products; qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue, and the increasing frequency and complexity of newly introduced products may magnify challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to manufacturing lead times. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. We build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications such as our Nvidia DGX Cloud services, Omniverse platform, large language models and generative AI models. In data center, we launched AI inference platforms that combine our full-stack inference software with Nvidia Ada, Nvidia Hopper and Nvidia Grace Hopper processors optimized for generative AI and other AI workloads, introduced Nvidia DGX Cloud and AI Foundations to help businesses create and operate custom large language models and generative AI models and announced Nvidia Spectrum-X, an accelerated networking platform for AI. In gaming, we launched the GeForce RTX 4060 and 4070 GPUs based on the Nvidia Ada Lovelace architecture, announced the Nvidia Avatar Cloud Engine for games, a custom AI model foundry service using AI-powered natural language interactions to transform games, launched DLSS 3.5 ray reconstruction and released TensorRT-LLM for Windows alongside GeForce RTX 40-series Super GPUs. In professional visualization, we announced new GPUs based on the Nvidia RTX Ada Lovelace architecture and Nvidia Omniverse Cloud, a fully managed service running in Microsoft Azure for the development and deployment of industrial metaverse applications. In automotive, we announced a partnership with MediaTek to develop mainstream automotive SoCs integrating a new Nvidia GPU chiplet IP for AI and graphics, furthered our collaboration with Foxconn to develop next-generation electric vehicles and announced further adoption of the Nvidia DRIVE platform with BYD, XPeng, GWM, Li Auto, Zeekr and Xiaomi. Within our supply chain, we continuously manage product availability and costs with our vendors, and as we shorten our product development cycles, enter new lines of business or integrate new suppliers or components into our supply chain, we recognize that additional supply chain complexity may impair our ability to secure sufficient capacity to address our business needs or meet long-term demand expectations.

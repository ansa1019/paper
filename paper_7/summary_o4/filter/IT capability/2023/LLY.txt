The discussion of our research and development cost reporting reveals that we accumulate certain R&D costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes but must make significant cost estimations and allocations, some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms, indicating challenges in information management and data reliability. We manage research and development spending across our portfolio of potential new medicines and indications and continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources—including working capital, capital expenditures, and business development activities—which reflects coordinated deployment of financial and operational resources. In addressing supply constraints for our incretin products, we implemented actions to manage demand amid tight supply, including measures to minimize impact to existing patients and efforts to bring tirzepatide to patients via different delivery presentations, demonstrating process optimization and coordination across internal and external relationships. Our controlled program of risk management employs derivative financial instruments—such as interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward or option contracts—guided by corporate policies on hedge coverage and fair value sensitivity analyses, underscoring connectivity among financial monitoring systems and strategic risk management practices. The acknowledgment of difficulties in reaching healthcare professionals, including digitally given the increase in virtual engagements, implies reliance on digital channels and information systems to support sales and marketing processes. The detailed modeling of sales returns, rebates, and discounts—based on historical payment data, contractual terms, and sales trends—and the establishment of related accruals at the time of sale highlight an information processing view that requires accurate, timely, and reliable data provision to support pricing and revenue recognition decisions.

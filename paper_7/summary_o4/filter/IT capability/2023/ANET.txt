Arista’s platforms deliver availability, agility, automation, analytics and security through an advanced network operating stack centred on EOS, a modernized publish-subscribe state-sharing networking operating system that, combined with a suite of network applications and Ethernet switching and routing platforms using best-of-breed merchant silicon, provides customers with a highly competitive, diversified portfolio offering improved price/performance and time to market. Since inception, Arista has reimagined cloud networks for performance, scale and programmability, differentiating itself through uncompromising quality, advanced open and standards-based technology and a robust quality assurance capability built on automated diagnostics. As organizations of all sizes migrate workloads to the cloud, our cloud networking platforms address growing performance requirements driven by the proliferation of connected devices and the need for constant connectivity and access to data and applications. Our development model focuses on rapidly developing new features and applications based on our EOS software—engineering products to be agnostic to underlying merchant silicon architectures—and expanding our software applications to support workflow automation, network visibility, analytics, network detection and response, and rapid integration with third-party virtualization, management, automation, orchestration and network services. To support these business and technical objectives, we continue to invest in our research and development organization to enhance the functionality of our existing cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership, with research and development expenses consisting primarily of personnel costs, prototype expenses, third-party engineering costs and an allocated portion of facility and IT costs. Similarly, our sales and marketing activities, which also include an allocated portion of facility and IT costs, and our operating lease arrangements for office space, data centre equipment and other corporate assets, underpin our ability to expand our sales force, reach new customers and provide services and support. In our revenue recognition process, hardware incorporates EOS software as essential functionality, and we apply judgment to determine standalone selling prices for products and post-contract support, reflecting our information management capability and our ability to tailor offerings in response to changing business needs. Through the mobilization and deployment of IT-based resources—technology, software, merchant silicon relationships, management skills and automated diagnostic practices—Arista seeks to support and enhance business strategies and work processes, transform the firm into a competitive force and coordinate its assets, internal processes and interfirm relationships.

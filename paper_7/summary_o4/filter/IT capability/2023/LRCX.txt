Our core technical competency is integrating hardware, process, materials, software, and process control enabling results on the wafer; our customer support business group provides products and services to maximize installed equipment performance, predictability and operational efficiency; we continued to make significant research and development investments focused on leading-edge deposition, etch, clean, and other semiconductor manufacturing processes, driven by an increase in employee-related costs, deferred compensation plan-related costs, spending for supplies, and depreciation and amortization; several factors create opportunity for sustainable differentiation for us including our ability to effectively leverage cycles of learning from our broad installed base, our collaborative focus with semi-ecosystem partners, our ability to identify and invest in the breadth of our product portfolio to meet technology inflections, and our focus on delivering our multi-product solutions with a goal to enhance the value of Lam’s solutions to our customers; we exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing and deliveries of products, which has impacted the timing of revenue recognition with respect to such products; anticipated cash flows from operations based on our current business outlook, combined with our current levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, are expected to be sufficient to support our anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, capital redistributions, and dividends through at least the next twelve months; our critical accounting policies include the recognition and valuation of revenue from arrangements with multiple performance obligations using a five-step process to identify contracts with customers, performance obligations, transaction prices, allocation of transaction prices, and recognition of revenue when or as performance obligations are satisfied; our inventory valuation policy assesses the valuation of manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts each reporting period using management’s forecasts related to future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and market obsolescence and general semiconductor market conditions; we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue and periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities; deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, including the tax effect of carryforwards; we review goodwill at least annually for impairment using both qualitative and quantitative assessments based on business conditions, financial performance, and estimated future cash flows; we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in research and development and capital infrastructure; and we believe that, if necessary, we will be able to access the capital markets on commercially reasonable terms to meet our objectives.

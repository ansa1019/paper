Nike’s consumer direct acceleration strategy emphasizes delivering compelling consumer experiences “through digital platforms and at retail,” with Nike direct operations comprising both owned retail stores and “sales through our digital platforms (also referred to as ‘Nike brand digital’)” that drove a 24 percent increase in Nike brand digital sales in fiscal 2023. The company “continues to invest in a new enterprise resource planning platform, data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering, and other areas to create an end-to-end technology foundation,” which it believes “will further accelerate our digital transformation,” accelerating growth, unlocking more efficiency, and driving speed and responsiveness in serving consumers globally. These digital transformation efforts include “strategic technology enterprise investments,” which contributed to a 12 percent increase in operating overhead expense, and the allocation of “costs associated with Nike direct global digital operations and enterprise technology” under global brand divisions. Furthermore, Nike discloses continued infrastructure investments “specifically focused around digital capabilities, our end-to-end technology foundation, our corporate facilities and improvements across our supply chain,” all of which underscore the firm’s deployment of IT-based resources in support of strategic business objectives.

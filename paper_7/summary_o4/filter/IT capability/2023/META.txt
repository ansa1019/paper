In 2023, our cost of revenue reflected the operation and deployment of IT capability through expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, including depreciation of servers, network infrastructure and buildings, payroll and related share-based compensation for operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs; as part of our investment philosophy, we continued to allocate resources to headcount, data centers and technical infrastructure to develop our apps and advertising services, with significant investments in artificial intelligence, including generative AI, to improve delivery, targeting and measurement capabilities and to drive onsite conversions in our business messaging ad products by developing and scaling new features. We are developing privacy-enhancing technologies to deliver relevant ads and measurement capabilities while reducing personal information processing, tools enabling marketers to share data into our systems, and new ad products that generate valuable signals within our apps. Our family metrics rely on complex techniques, algorithms and machine learning models to estimate unique users across multiple products with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability and connectivity, calibrated against survey data. Under our restructuring program we completed data center initiatives and facilities consolidations to improve operational flexibility. In our Reality Labs segment, we continued to invest in long-term technology development for virtual, augmented and mixed reality devices, software, content and neural interfaces as foundational metaverse technologies, and we anticipate capital expenditures of $30 billion to $37 billion in 2024 for data centers, servers and network infrastructure to support our ongoing business innovation and IT capability enhancement.

Goldman Sachs’ management discussion emphasizes the firm’s growing dependence on technology as a key operational asset, noting that its global risk management structure incorporates dedicated systems and teams to govern and deploy IT-based controls across all lines of business.  The firm has established an enterprise-wide cybersecurity program, administered by Technology Risk within Engineering and overseen by its Chief Information Security Officer, that is designed to identify, assess, document and mitigate emerging threats through preventive and detective controls, continuous network monitoring for vulnerabilities and unauthorized access, and robust incident response capabilities.  Core components of this program include identity and access management, software change management and open-source software governance, application and mobile security, data security (including cryptography, encryption, database security, data erasure and media disposal), cloud computing governance for Software-as-a-Service onboarding, and Technology Operations functions for change management, incident management, capacity planning and resilience.  These IT capabilities are supplemented by specialized risk management applications that capture, analyze, aggregate and report operational risk event data and key metrics, as well as market risk management systems that independently calculate value-at-risk, earnings-at-risk and other stress measures through full valuation of market factors at the position level.  To mitigate third-party and supply-chain risks arising from extensive vendor relationships, the firm’s Third-Party Risk Program conducts risk-based due diligence and ongoing oversight across multiple domains—cybersecurity, operational resilience and information-security compliance—ensuring that external service providers adhere to the same rigorous security and governance standards.

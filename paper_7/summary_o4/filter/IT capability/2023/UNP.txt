During 2023 we continued to refine our proprietary software called Precision Train Builder to evaluate train and route characteristics and simulate in-train forces, enabling our operating practices command center to proactively intervene to prevent derailments; we also installed additional hot bearing-way detectors and adopted enhanced standards for proactively using and sharing critical data, and the industry expanded deployment of technology for real-time railcar condition monitoring.  Our operating practices command center will be positioned to implement predictive technology to reduce variability by identifying causes of mainline service interruptions and developing solutions, while we plan to utilize data to identify and mitigate exposure to risk, detect rail defects, improve or close crossings, and educate the public and law enforcement about crossing safety through our own and industry programs across the network.  Management continuously monitors key operating metrics weekly and provides this data to the Surface Transportation Board, reflecting our use of information management capability and analytic monitoring systems to evaluate operational efficiency and deliver the service product promised to customers.  In our capital plan for 2024, we expect to invest approximately $310 million in technology and other initiatives, including projects to modernize locomotives, improve operational efficiency and support growth, and we continue to utilize climate scenario analyses and refine data-driven approaches to understand and respond to climate-related risks and opportunities.  Computer software costs are included in our general and administrative expenses, indicating ongoing investment in IT resources to support our safety, service and operational excellence objectives.

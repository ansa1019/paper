Technology is the foundation of our company and we make our investments with an eye towards long-term strengthening and leveraging of these advantages, spanning how we select R&D projects, develop new capabilities like ti.com, invest in new manufacturing capacity and refine our capital allocation decisions. The reach of our market channels gives access to more customers and their design projects and provides better insight and knowledge of customer needs, reflecting our information management capability to deliver timely, reliable data in support of business strategies. As part of our long-term capacity planning, we continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantage in manufacturing and technology, with capital expenditures expected to remain elevated, and pursue efficiency initiatives to drive more output for every dollar spent through technology-enabled processes. Additionally, our non-GAAP measure of free cash flow and related ratios provide insight into our cash-generating capability and the mobilization of financial and technology resources to support ongoing business transformation and value creation.

Technology and development expenses consist primarily of payroll, stock-based compensation, facilities and other related expenses for technology personnel responsible for making improvements to our service offerings, including testing, maintaining and modifying our user interface, our recommendations, merchandising and infrastructure, as well as costs associated with general-use computer hardware and software, and these expenses remained relatively flat year-over-year; we have built our own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the Internet, with delivery expenses including equipment costs related to Open Connect, payroll and related personnel expenses and all third-party costs, such as cloud computing costs associated with delivering content; streaming delivery and other operations costs include customer service and payment processing fees paid to our integrated payment partners; memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by the company’s internal systems, which utilize industry-standard geo-location technology; marketing expenses include digital and television advertising activities supported by consumer electronics manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors, mobile operators and ISPs; and our ability to obtain financing for potential strategic acquisitions and investments will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, operating performance and business plans.

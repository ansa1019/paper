Our da Vinci products have been digitally enabled for nearly three decades, encompassing robotic platforms, software, vision systems, energy devices, instruments, and accessories that integrate computational hardware and software to provide surgeons with an immersive console-based interface featuring 3D high-definition visualization, natural instrument articulation akin to a human wrist, tremor filtration, and user-tailored controls; within this integrated ecosystem, we offer a comprehensive suite of systems, learning, and services designed to work together to decrease variability in surgery by delivering dependable, consistent functionality and an integrated user experience and by providing actionable insights through digital solutions to improve clinical outcomes, personalize learning, and optimize operational efficiency. Our learning category includes educational technologies such as simulation products, telepresence remote case observation and telementoring tools, technical training programs, and personalized peer-to-peer learning opportunities, while our services category assists minimally invasive programs with readiness assessments, on-demand support, consultation for procedural optimization, and customized hospital analytics. The vast majority of our installed systems are connected via the internet—enabling field engineers to access system logs even for offline units—and we leverage this connectivity along with other data from customer agreements and usage patterns as critical inputs for financial and operational decision-making, employing metrics such as installed base, system placements, and procedures per system per year to guide forecasting, resource allocation, performance analysis, and the continuous reconfiguration of our technology resources in support of evolving clinical and business needs.

PepsiCo notes that it is operating in a rapidly changing retail landscape marked by growth in e-commerce websites, mobile commerce applications and subscription services and by the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers, and it continues to monitor shifts to e-commerce, online-to-offline and other online purchasing behaviors to identify actions for building its global e-commerce and digital capabilities, including expanding its direct-to-consumer business across new and emerging channels of trade. In its positive agriculture outcomes accelerator, the company has invested in digital enablers such as weather stations, on-farm water analysis and sprinkler irrigation systems and has deployed agritech solutions like Agroscout, which combines artificial intelligence and drone technology to detect crop diseases more efficiently. In recognition of the strategic importance of information systems, PepsiCo’s enterprise risk management framework elevates cybersecurity risks—including the increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to its information systems—to full-board oversight, with updates provided by external experts, and assigns responsibility for risk assessment and mitigation to a cross-functional senior management group that includes the head of information technology. Throughout its operations, PepsiCo leverages connectivity with more than one billion daily consumer interactions to drive innovation and positive change across its value chain.

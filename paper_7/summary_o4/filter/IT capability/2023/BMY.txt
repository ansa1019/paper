Cost of products sold includes proportionate allocations of enterprise-wide costs, explicitly identifying facilities and information technology among the overhead components, and marketing, selling and administrative expenses as well as research and development expenses similarly reflect allocations for information technology resources alongside facilities and employee stock compensation. Our revenue recognition policy and gross-to-net adjustments depend on integrated information management capabilities that combine internal demand forecasts with third-party market research data and weekly wholesaler reports on product-level inventory and out-movement to estimate prescription demand, average selling prices, rebates, returns and other channel adjustments. We have instituted a company-wide policy and governance framework under the SEC consent order that mandates weekly data feeds from our three largest U.S. wholesalers, escalation procedures for compliance questions, and regular monitoring to limit sales to direct customers based on expected demand and estimated months on hand. These data-driven processes and technology infrastructure coordinate manufacturing, supply chain, commercial and financial functions, mobilizing IT-based resources in combination with other organizational capabilities to enhance operational efficiency, resource allocation and regulatory compliance.

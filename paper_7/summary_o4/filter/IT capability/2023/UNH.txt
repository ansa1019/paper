UnitedHealth Group is actively accelerating its transition to fully accountable value-based care by innovating and integrating its care delivery models—spanning in-clinic, in-home, behavioral and virtual channels—and by leveraging data and analytics to furnish clinicians with accurate, timely information for high-quality, cost-efficient care; this shift is driving targeted investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems to support coordinated care around primary care physicians and emerging primary care channels; the company identifies initial costs for this transition as including system enhancements, integrated care coordination technology, physician training and clinical engagement; moreover, Optum Insight revenues and earnings from operations have increased due to growth in technology services, and the organization’s capital expenditures include significant purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software to bolster its information management and IT resource deployment capabilities.

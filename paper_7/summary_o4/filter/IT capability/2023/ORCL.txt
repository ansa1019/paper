Oracle provides products and services that address enterprise information technology (IT) environments, including enterprise applications and infrastructure offerings delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models—on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid—that offer choice and flexibility to customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit customers’ needs. Our three operating segments—cloud and license, hardware and services—reflect how our chief operating decision makers, including our chief executive officer and chief technology officer, view our operating results and allocate resources, from managing Oracle cloud capacity requirements to meet existing and prospective customer demand to making investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new offerings. In our cloud and license business, we deliver applications and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we develop, deploy, host, manage and support, recognize revenue ratably or as consumed, and enable customers to renew license support contracts to receive technical support services and periodic updates and enhancements. Our hardware business provides engineered systems, servers, storage and related software products, accounts for hardware and software as combined performance obligations recognized at delivery, and offers hardware support contracts that provide unspecified software updates, maintenance and technical support recognized ratably over the contractual term. Our services business helps customers maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies through consulting and advanced customer services differentiated by our focus on Oracle technologies, extensive experience, intellectual property and best practices. We also pursue targeted acquisitions of complementary companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of corporate strategy, estimating their financial impact on earnings, operating margin, cash flows and return on invested capital before consummation, and we fund these and other strategic and operational initiatives through internally available cash, cash generated from operations, credit agreements, senior notes, commercial paper and, when appropriate, equity repurchases and dividends.

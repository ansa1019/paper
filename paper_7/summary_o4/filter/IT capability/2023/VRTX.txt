The company employs data‐driven processes to estimate and recognize product revenues, tracking information on payor mix, third‐party payor contractual terms, government program requirements and distribution channel levels to adjust rebate provisions; it forecasts annual reimbursement limits under government‐supported contracts by modeling unit distributions based on historical experience and defers or recognizes consideration accordingly; revenue recognition follows control transfer principles with transaction price determined through estimates of rebates, chargebacks, discounts and fees; the company relies on a global network of third parties and internal capabilities to manufacture and distribute products, maintaining supply chain and quality assurance systems and adapting them to increased volumes and new modalities; the greater complexity of cell and genetic therapies necessitates additional investments in different systems, equipment, facilities and expertise; and its critical accounting policies for revenue recognition and acquisitions require significant judgments, forecasting, valuation and information management to support estimates and decision-making.

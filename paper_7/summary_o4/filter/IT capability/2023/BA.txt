The Company’s global services segment description that “the aerospace markets we serve include parts distribution, logistics and other inventory services; maintenance, engineering and upgrades; training and professional services; and data analytics and digital services” and the fleet support services disclosure that “these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane” and “include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents” reflect the firm’s deployment of IT‐based resources to provide data, information and digital capabilities in support of operations. Additionally, management’s statements that “we continually monitor the health and stability of the supply chain” and “we continually monitor the global trade environment in response to geopolitical economic developments, as well as changes in tariffs, trade agreements or sanctions” imply the ongoing use of information management processes and systems to coordinate assets, internal processes and interfirm relationships.

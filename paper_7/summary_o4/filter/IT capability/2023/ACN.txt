Management’s discussion and analysis emphasizes Accenture’s coordination of technology and business processes by combining its strength in technology and leadership in cloud, data and AI with industry experience, functional expertise and global delivery capability to help clients build their digital core, optimize operations, accelerate revenue growth and enhance services at speed and scale. Consulting revenues were driven by client initiatives to accelerate digital transformation—moving to the cloud, embedding enterprise-wide security and adopting new technologies—focused on delivering cost savings, operational efficiency, growth acceleration and improved customer experiences. Managed services revenues grew on strong demand for application modernization and maintenance, cloud enablement and cybersecurity-as-a-service, as well as projects to transform operations through data and analytics, automation and artificial intelligence to drive productivity and operational cost savings. Cost of services explicitly includes technology-related activities such as software development, contract delivery and the integration of acquisitions, while general and administrative costs encompass information systems expenditures. Revenue recognition for technology integration consulting services is measured by progress toward completion based on costs incurred relative to total estimated costs, and variable consideration from incentives or penalties tied to performance is evaluated on a contract-by-contract basis. The company has committed $3.7 billion to cloud hosting arrangements, software subscriptions and information technology services in the ordinary course of business. To mitigate rising compensation costs, management continually adjusts the mix of personnel and leverages technology resources to drive cost and delivery efficiencies, thereby supporting margin and contract profitability.

We continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to develop new, innovative offerings, improve our existing offerings, rapidly and responsibly deploy AI across our businesses, and expand our product suite to meet changing user and advertiser needs in a multi-device world. To support the growth of our business and long-term initiatives—particularly in AI products and services—we expect to increase investment in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, which constitute our information technology assets for computing, storage, and networking requirements. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include depreciation expense related to this technical infrastructure, compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D, third-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our engineering and product development efforts, and compensation expense related to our data centers and other support operations. We also invest through acquisitions and strategic partnerships to broaden our expertise in engineering and other functional areas and to build strong partnerships around strategic initiatives, which augment our ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources—from cloud-based infrastructure and platform services such as cybersecurity, databases, analytics, and AI offerings including our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Duet AI for Google Cloud, to communication and collaboration tools in Google Workspace—thus reinforcing our IT capability to effectively support and enhance our business strategies and work processes, drive continuous business transformation, and maintain a competitive advantage.

T-Mobileâ€™s merger-related integration activities included information technology and back office operational rationalization, customer migration to unified network and billing systems, and related legal integration matters; network integration and decommissioning initiatives also encompassed the acceleration or termination of operating and financing leases for cell sites, switch sites and network equipment and the retirement of legacy CDMA and LTE networks to facilitate migration to unified platforms. Depreciation and amortization expense growth reflected assets placed into service from the accelerated build-out of the nationwide 5G network and the ramp-up of internally developed and purchased software. Capital expenditures primarily funded the integration of network and spectrum licenses, including Sprint PCS and 2.5 GHz acquisitions, and deployment of 5G infrastructure, with future requirements expected for C-band and 3.45 GHz spectrum license deployments. Higher capitalized interest expense was driven by deployment activities related to C-band spectrum licenses. In 2024, operating expenses are expected to increase, primarily driven by higher depreciation and amortization from assets placed into service associated with the accelerated build-out of our nationwide 5G network and the acceleration of certain technology assets as we continue to modernize our network and technology systems and platforms.

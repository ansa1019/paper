Amazon’s discussion and analysis highlights its mobilization and deployment of IT-based resources to coordinate internal processes and interfirm relationships, with a strategic focus on technology and infrastructure investments that support and enhance business strategies and work processes. The company identifies its technology and infrastructure costs as including payroll and related expenses for employees involved in research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of its online stores and curation of product displays, as well as servers, networking equipment, data center depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Amazon believes that advances in technology—specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, data storage and analytics, improved wireless connectivity, and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning—will continue to improve user experience and Internet ubiquity, and to best take advantage of these advances it is investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, to developers and enterprises of all sizes. The company expects spending in technology and infrastructure to increase over time as it adds computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees, and it seeks to invest efficiently in areas of technology and infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve process efficiencies through rapid technology developments at scale. These capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of Amazon’s systems and operations, and fixed costs include the costs necessary to build, enhance, and add features to online stores, web services, electronic devices, digital offerings, and its fulfillment network, while variable costs include costs necessary to run AWS.

During 2023 we made important progress on our artificial intelligence strategy, bringing together multiple AI teams across AMD to execute an end-to-end AI hardware strategy and drive development of a comprehensive software ecosystem spanning our full product portfolio. We enhanced the performance and features of our AMD ROCm software by releasing our latest AMD ROCm 6 open software platform for AI and HPC workloads, and we expanded our open AI software capabilities through strategic acquisitions, including Mipsology SAS in August 2023 to help develop the full AMD AI software stack and expand an open ecosystem of software tools, libraries and models, and Nod, Inc. in October 2023 to accelerate deployment of AI solutions optimized for AMD Instinct data center accelerators, Ryzen AI processors, EPYC processors, Versal SoCs and Radeon GPUs. Our AI strategy is focused on delivering a broad portfolio and multigenerational roadmap of leadership CPUs, GPUs and adaptive computing solutions for AI inference and training, extending the open software platform we have established to enable our AI hardware to be deployed broadly and with ease, and expanding the deep and collaborative engagements we have established across ecosystems to accelerate deployments of AMD-based AI solutions at scale.

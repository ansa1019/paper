Mastercard characterizes itself as a technology company in the global payments industry, connecting consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide by enabling electronic payments and making those payment transactions safe, simple, smart and accessible through its family of trusted brands. It operates a multi-rail payments network and a unique proprietary core global payments network that authorizes, clears and settles payment transactions and further extends its information technology capabilities through automated clearing house transactions, open banking solutions and digital identity capabilities to capture new payment flows. Its value-added services encompass cyber and intelligence solutions that draw on secure consumer and merchant data to provide proprietary insights and scale fraud and security management, alongside consulting, marketing and loyalty offerings. Mastercardâ€™s multi-layered security approach and franchise model support interoperability and risk management across stakeholders, while ongoing investments in data processing, telecommunications infrastructure and software capitalization underpin its ability to deliver accurate, timely, secure, confidential and tailored connectivity and access in response to evolving business needs. Operational metrics such as gross dollar volume and switched transactions growth reflect the scalability and efficiency of its transaction processing systems, and transaction processing assessments based on data transmission volumes and authorization and settlement messaging further illustrate the interdependence of its technology capabilities in supporting global business strategies and interfirm relationships.

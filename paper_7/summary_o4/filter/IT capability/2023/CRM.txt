Salesforce describes its Customer 360 platform as uniting sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT teams by “connecting customer data across systems, apps and devices to create a complete view of customers,” thereby enabling teams to be more responsive, productive and efficient and to deliver intelligent, personalized experiences across every channel. The company continues to invest in its cloud infrastructure, including “enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity,” third-party technology, services and data, and to evolve its security measures, all in support of scalability and operational flexibility. Research and development expenses, which consist primarily of engineering personnel costs and related overhead, are directed toward the development of new technologies and the improvement of existing ones, including investments in generative AI across all products and the integration of acquired technologies. Professional services resources facilitate adoption of cloud and subscription offerings, secure larger subscription contracts and support customer success, while marketing and sales initiatives leveraging self-serve and partner-led channels aim to increase sales productivity and expand industry-specific reach. General and administrative expenses include allocations for information technology infrastructure and management information systems. Strategic investments in privately held equity and debt securities require valuation judgments and monitoring systems to assess market acceptance, financial metrics and impairment indicators. The company’s contractual commitments encompass co-location data center facility leases and investments in offices, software and hardware, and it plans to upgrade or replace internal systems to scale with continued growth. Restructuring initiatives, including workforce reductions and office space exits, are intended to drive operational efficiencies and improve margins. These disclosures reflect Salesforce’s ongoing efforts to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources in support and enhancement of its business strategies, work processes and interfirm relationships.

Net sales from our six e-commerce sites “combined amounted to less than 2% of total sales for both fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023,” and our marmaxx digital channels—“tjmaxx.com and marshalls.com, together with sierra.com, represented less than 3% of marmaxx’s net sales for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 and did not have a significant impact on year-over-year segment margin comparisons.” During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we extended online shopping capabilities by making “online shopping available in Germany at tkmaxx.de and in Austria at tkmaxx.at.” Looking ahead, we expect fiscal 2025 capital expenditures of approximately $2.0 billion to $2.1 billion, including “approximately $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion for our offices and distribution centers (including buying and merchandising systems and other information systems) to support growth,” reflecting ongoing investment in digital infrastructure, information systems and related capabilities to coordinate our assets, processes and inter-regional operations.

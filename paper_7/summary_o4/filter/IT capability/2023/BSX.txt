As part of our capital and operational strategy, we continued to invest in our digital and operational infrastructure, including purchases of property, plant and equipment and internal use software of $711 million in 2023 (and $588 million in 2022) to meet capacity needs. Our revenue recognition process for products with ongoing service obligations, such as the LATITUDE™ Patient Management System and the LUX-Dx™ insertable cardiac monitor system, reflects our information management capability by deferring revenue on unfulfilled performance obligations and recognizing it over the related service period based on device longevity and usage, allocating transaction prices using a relative standalone selling price method and estimating standalone selling prices using an expected cost plus margin approach; these systems require data delivery with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access, tailored in response to changing business needs. The 2023 restructuring plan, which advances our global supply chain optimization strategy to simplify our manufacturing and distribution network by transferring production lines among facilities and drive operational efficiencies and resiliency, underscores our focus on process optimization and resource reconfiguration. We have designed an internal control process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting, including policies and procedures to maintain accurate records, authorize transactions and prevent or timely detect unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets, reflecting our emphasis on control systems and information accuracy. Our global real estate, facilities, environment, health & safety function rigorously measures, assesses and reports progress toward energy and environmental targets using ISO 50001:2018 and ISO 14001:2015 management systems and site-level monitoring, demonstrating our capability to manage and analyze operational data to support organizational goals. Further, management’s use of adjusted non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance, allocate resources and set operational goals, excluding non-cash, non-recurring and acquisition-related charges, highlights our strategic use of performance metrics and information resources for decision-making support in a dynamic regulatory and economic environment.

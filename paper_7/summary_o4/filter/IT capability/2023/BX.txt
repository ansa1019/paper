Blackstone’s 2023 results reflect modest investments in technology‐enabled resources, as evidenced by its inclusion of “market data and technology‐related expenses” within other operating expenses and by the firm’s strategic focus on “digital infrastructure” as a core sector in both its real estate and private equity portfolios, suggesting an emphasis on deploying and leveraging digital technologies and connectivity to support asset management, inform investment decisions and enhance operational processes.

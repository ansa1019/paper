We have built and deployed advanced information technology capabilities to coordinate assets, internal processes and interfirm relationships across our acceptance, fintech and payments segments, providing account processing and digital banking solutions, card issuer processing and network services, e-commerce and merchant acquiring and processing, and the Clover® cloud-based point-of-sale and business management platform. The acceptance segment’s commerce-enabling solutions include merchant acquiring and digital commerce services, mobile payment services, security and fraud protection products and integrated cloud-based operating systems for small and mid-sized businesses (Clover) and CaratSM for large enterprises, while the fintech segment delivers core digital banking, financial and risk management, general ledger and central information file processing complemented by professional services and consulting, and the payments segment furnishes digital payment software and services—including debit, credit and prepaid card processing, non-card bill payment, account-to-account transfers, person-to-person payments and electronic billing—supported by network services and fraud protection. We are modernizing our technology infrastructure to enhance operational performance, integration and scalability, allocating resources to integrate our platforms and value-added solutions, expanding the use of data and real-time payments infrastructure, and leveraging economies of scale in infrastructure, products, services and networks to support evolving regulatory, cybersecurity and customer experience requirements. Strategic acquisitions—Skytef and SLED distributors of electronic funds transfer software, Nextable’s cloud-based reservation and table management solutions, and Finxact’s cloud-native banking platform—further advance our digital transformation, expand our distribution network and enhance instant payment, merchant distribution, reservation and account processing capabilities, underscoring our IT function’s competence to deploy, integrate and reconfigure technology resources in support of business strategies, efficiency, innovation and market responsiveness.

Amgen discloses that it monitors the inventory levels of its products at wholesalers by using data from wholesalers and other third parties and maintains inventories at appropriate levels given end-user demand, noting that historical fluctuations have not significantly affected its method of estimating sales deductions and returns, and that it analyzes the adequacy of its accruals for sales deductions quarterly, adjusting them for current contractual and statutory requirements, known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. The company’s approach to and investment in human capital resource management is directed at attracting, motivating, developing and retaining talent to tackle the challenges of running an enterprise focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative medicines, with compensation, benefits and development programs designed to encourage performance, promote accountability and adherence to company values and align with shareholder interests, and with a belief that a diverse and inclusive culture fosters innovation. Amgen’s primary objective for its investment portfolio is to maintain safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk, with an investment policy that limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings and that places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer. The company groups all of its research and development activities and related expenditures into three categories—research and early pipeline, later-stage clinical programs and marketed products—to organize processes and resource deployment, and intends to continue investing in its business while reducing debt and returning capital to stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases, optimizing its cost of capital and coordinating internal processes based on factors such as capital requirements, debt levels, credit rating, financing availability, regulatory and corporate law changes and periodic determinations by its board of directors. To manage financial exposures and liquidity, Amgen employs interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges and cross-currency swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges to achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt and to hedge foreign currency risks, operates a commercial paper program to fund working-capital needs, and maintains a syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement as a liquidity backstop, with the timing and amount of financing activities driven by forecasts of future cash flows, credit ratings and compliance with applicable laws and covenants.

Gilead discloses that it continues to invest in its R&D pipeline through acquisitions and collaborations and manages its R&D expenses by identifying the R&D activities expected to be performed during a given period and prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of successful technical development and regulatory approval, market potential, available human and capital resources and other considerations, while regularly reviewing its R&D activities based on unmet medical need and reallocating resources among its internal R&D portfolio and external opportunities to support the long-term growth of the business. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, infrastructure, materials and supplies and other support costs, as well as research and clinical studies performed by contract research organizations and collaboration partners. The company employs a complex estimation process for rebates and chargebacks that requires significant judgment and draws on statutory discount requirements and contractual terms, historical claims experience and processing time lags, known market events and trends, market research, channel inventory data obtained from its major U.S. wholesalers and other pertinent internal or external information. It uses foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a portion of its foreign currency exposures and regularly evaluates its liquidity and capital resources, including access to external capital, to ensure that it can adequately and efficiently finance its operations, believing that its existing capital resources, including cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and its revolving credit facility supplemented by operating cash flows, will be adequate to satisfy its capital needs for the foreseeable future. These descriptions implicitly reflect Gilead’s IT capability in mobilizing and deploying information-based resources to coordinate the firm’s assets and internal processes, integrate external relationships and support strategic resource allocation, data-driven decision-making and effective governance.

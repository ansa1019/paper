Subscription revenues encompass both cloud-based and self-hosted offerings in which the software element is recognized upfront upon delivery and related support and updates are recognized ratably over the contract term, reflecting the deployment and life-cycle management of IT resources. Cost of subscription revenues consists primarily of data center capacity costs—including colocation and interconnectivity costs between data centers—depreciation of infrastructure hardware dedicated to customer use, amortization of intangible assets, software expenses, public cloud service costs, IT services and dedicated customer support, and personnel-related costs for data center operations and support, illustrating the firm’s investment in technology infrastructure and operational support capabilities. Research and development expenses include increased headcount costs and data center capacity costs and depreciation of infrastructure hardware used solely for R&D, supporting continuous enhancement of the platform’s technology functionalities. Professional services and training are delivered on a time-and-materials or fixed-fee basis by an internal services organization and contracted third-party partners to facilitate implementation and enable customers’ process redesign and organizational transformation. Digital workflow products are generally priced on a per-user basis and IT operations management products on a subscription unit basis, reflecting a flexible and modular technology portfolio designed to align with customers’ business strategies and evolving needs.

Visa describes itself as a global payments technology company that facilitates global commerce and money movement across more than 200 countries and territories among a global set of consumers, merchants, financial institutions and government entities through innovative technologies, providing transaction processing services—primarily authorization, clearing and settlement—via VisaNet, its proprietary advanced transaction processing network. The company’s network and processing expenses mainly represent expenses for the operation of this processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services, while depreciation and amortization expenses include amortization of internally developed and purchased software and acquired technology intangible assets such as developed technology. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs, including technology integration fees, as exemplified by the pending acquisition of Pismo Holdings, a cloud-native issuer processing and core banking platform with operations in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe. Purchase obligations include future commitments related to software licenses, and Visa’s ongoing investments in technology infrastructure and cloud-native platforms underscore its competence in mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources to support and enhance its business strategies, operational efficiency and the secure, reliable and efficient coordination of its internal processes and interfirm transactions.

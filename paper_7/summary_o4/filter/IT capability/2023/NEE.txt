Management’s discussion describes the use of an internally developed non-GAAP metric, adjusted earnings, “for financial planning, analysis of performance, reporting of results to the board of directors and as an input in determining performance-based compensation under NEE’s employee incentive compensation plans,” and its communication to analysts and investors, reflecting an information management capability to tailor data for varying audiences; the establishment of an Exposure Management Committee “responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels,” which “receives periodic updates on market positions and related exposures, credit exposures and overall risk management activities,” illustrates institutional governance supported by systems for monitoring derivative transactions; the recognition of derivative instruments at fair value using “internally developed models which estimate the fair value of a contract by calculating the present value of the difference between the contract price and the forward prices” and the deferral of changes in fair value as regulatory assets or liabilities under FPL’s cost recovery clauses evidences coordinated IT-supported valuation processes; the requirement for NEE and its subsidiaries to maintain a ratio of funded debt to total capitalization “as a condition to borrowing or issuance of letters of credit under their credit facilities,” along with automated tracking of borrowings, collateral and covenant compliance, indicates technology-enabled resource monitoring; actuarial valuations for pension and decommissioning obligations, based on assumptions for discount rates, mortality tables, expected long-term rates of return and market-related methods, underscore reliance on data analytics and modeling tools; and the management of credit risk through master netting agreements, collateral requirements and counterparty credit limits, combined with liquidity and capital resources planning—encompassing cash flows from operations, borrowings, debt and equity issuances, tax credit sales and asset dispositions—points to integrated information systems that support strategic decision making, regulatory reporting and operational efficiency.

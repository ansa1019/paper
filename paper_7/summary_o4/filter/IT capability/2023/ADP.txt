We are a leading global provider of cloud-based human capital management (“HCM”) technology solutions to employers around the world, offering both software and outsourcing services that we continuously seek to enhance to support our clients through a dynamic business and regulatory landscape and the changing world of work. During fiscal 2023, our systems development and programming costs increased due to higher investments and costs to develop, support, and maintain our new and existing products, and our depreciation and amortization expenses rose as a result of the amortization of internally developed software products and new investments in purchased software. We crossed a major milestone by surpassing the one-million client mark, driven by continued enhancements to our key solutions such as RUN and Workforce Now, and we continued the deployment of our unified user experience to key portions of our portfolio, including the RUN mobile app. We were also awarded Top HR Product for the eighth consecutive year in recognition of our recently launched intelligent self-service solution. We believe these results are largely attributable to our sustained investments in research and development and our company-wide transformation initiatives, including consulting costs related to our broad-based transformation agenda and costs of our transformation office, which are fundamental to strengthening our ability to mobilize and deploy technology-based resources in support of our business strategies and to drive meaningful transformation in the way we operate.

The MD&A primarily addresses manufacturing, supply chain and financial metrics but discloses several initiatives and controls that implicitly rely on robust IT capability, including the company’s response to the China Cyberspace Administration’s cybersecurity review concluding that its products present a cybersecurity risk and restricting sales by critical information infrastructure operators, the implementation of productivity programs across the business to manage costs and drive operational efficiency, continuous evaluation of alternatives to fund capital expenditures and operations, strategic investments in manufacturing technologies, facilities and equipment to support growth and maintain product quality, planned expansion of its global back-end assembly and test network in Xi’an and Gujarat, India, inventory and wafer-start management driven by supply-demand conditions, and financial risk mitigation through diversified, high-credit-quality investments—all of which underscore the firm’s need to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources to coordinate assets, internal processes, interfirm relationships and information security in support of its business strategies, agility and resilience.

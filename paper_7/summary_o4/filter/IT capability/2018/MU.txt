During fiscal 2018, we demonstrated organizational resilience through “strong execution in delivering high-value products featuring our 1xnm DRAM and 64-layer 3D NAND technologies,” which drove a 50 percent increase in total net sales and raised our overall gross margin to 59 percent, while enhancements in product and process technology enabled higher manufacturing output and manufacturing cost reductions; we “periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment,” extending equipment lives from five to seven years to improve operating flexibility and reduce depreciation expense by approximately $100 million per quarter; our decision to “share the cost of certain product and process development activities under development agreements with partners” allows us to optimize technology roadmaps and manage R&D expense volatility even as reimbursements under these agreements are expected to decline in early fiscal 2019; we maintain business continuity and liquidity through an undrawn $2 billion revolving credit facility, diversified money-market and investment-grade securities to “mitigate credit risk,” and a board-authorized $10 billion share repurchase program, supported by $7.28 billion of cash and marketable investments—of which $3.08 billion is held by foreign subsidiaries—and operating cash flows that “are highly dependent on selling prices for our products, which can vary significantly” but are projected to suffice through the next twelve months; proactive risk mitigation and resource allocation are further evidenced by ongoing assessments of deferred tax assets and liabilities under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, lower-of-cost-or-net-realizable-value inventory write-downs based on projected selling prices and volumes, and impairment reviews of property, plant, and equipment; together, these strategic initiatives, operational adjustments, and financial management practices position us to absorb strain, preserve performance under internal and external disturbances, and adapt to evolving market conditions.

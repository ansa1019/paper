Our fiscal year 2018 results reflect the implementation of targeted restructuring and streamlining initiatives—spanning the acquisition of the East China joint venture, conversion of Singapore, Taiwan and Brazil operations to licensed models, closure of underperforming Teavana™ stores and the sale or licensing of non-core assets such as the Tazo brand and certain CPG and foodservice businesses under the global coffee alliance with Nestlé—in order to accelerate growth in high-returning businesses, remove slow-growth activities and reallocate resources toward core value drivers. Concurrently, we realigned our organizational and segment structures, revised prior period financial information and reclassified operating expenses to better synchronize costs with revenue-generating activities, all of which support enhanced operating flexibility and system integrity under varying market conditions. The transition from equity to consolidation accounting for East China yielded incremental depreciation and amortization expenses and lower equity income, underscoring the disciplined investments in our technology infrastructure, digital platforms and partner development necessary to absorb the operational strain of consolidation while maintaining performance. We invested $2.0 billion in capital expenditures focused on new and existing stores and strategic store-related initiatives, and we manage liquidity and financial risk through diversified available-for-sale securities, a $2.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility, a $3.0 billion backstopped commercial paper program and hedging strategies for commodity price volatility (including fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed coffee contracts and financial derivatives) and foreign currency exposures. Looking ahead to fiscal 2019, we have articulated three strategic priorities—accelerate growth in the U.S. and China, sharpen shareholder returns and expand the reach of the Starbucks brand through market realignment, business simplification and the global coffee alliance—which together constitute a coherent framework for reconfiguring our temporal trajectories in response to disruptive events and sustaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

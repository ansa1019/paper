The annual report discloses forward-looking statements about the objectives and effectiveness of our business continuity plan, information security program, risk management and liquidity policies, as well as statements about our resolution plan and resolution strategy and their implications for our debtholders and other stakeholders, and about the design and effectiveness of our resolution capital and liquidity models and our triggers and alerts framework.  It further describes a comprehensive and conservative set of liquidity and funding policies whose principal objective is to enable us to fund ourselves and allow our core businesses to continue serving clients and generating revenues even under adverse circumstances.  To test our resilience, we conduct scenario analyses as part of our capital planning and stress-testing process—including CCAR and DFAST—and under our resolution and recovery planning, covering both short- and long-term horizons with a range of macroeconomic and firm-specific assumptions, in order to ensure we maintain appropriate funding, liquidity and capital under severely stressed conditions.  We also maintain a contingency funding plan that provides a detailed framework for analyzing and responding to liquidity crises or market stress, identifying potential risk factors, key reports and metrics and specifying actions—such as pre-funding of estimated cash and collateral needs and accessing secondary liquidity sources—to mitigate those risks.  In support of our preferred resolution strategy, we have established a resolution capital adequacy and positioning framework and a triggers and alerts framework designed to inform the board on if and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings.  Underlying these efforts is an enterprise risk management framework—governed by our board and its risk committee and implemented through three lines of defense, specialized risk-oversight committees and senior-management forums—that is intended to identify, assess, monitor and manage liquidity, market, credit, operational, model, legal, compliance, conduct, regulatory and reputational risks, to impose limits and thresholds consistent with our risk appetite, and to ensure timely escalation and effective decision-making.  As part of our balance-sheet and asset-liability management, we prepare multi-year balance sheet plans, allocate global core liquid assets to cover potential outflows, employ stress and intraday liquidity models, diversify and lengthen our funding profile, and regularly review and validate all models through an independent model-risk management process.

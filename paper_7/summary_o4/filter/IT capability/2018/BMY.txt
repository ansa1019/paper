Cost savings resulting from our transformation initiatives continue to be redeployed in research and development and other areas of higher priority to enhance our ability to maintain performance under challenging conditions, and through our operating model transformation we have evolved commercial, R&D and manufacturing resources toward prioritized brands and markets, strengthened capabilities in tumor biology, patient selection and biomarkers, delivered leaner administrative functions and streamlined our manufacturing network to reflect the importance of biologics in our current and future portfolio. The evolution in our operating model, which focuses on maintaining a disciplined approach in marketing, selling and administrative expenses, provides the strategic, financial and operational flexibility necessary to invest in the highest-priority opportunities within our portfolio, supporting our ongoing commitment to business continuity and adaptive resource allocation. We continue to advance our pipeline both internally and through business development activities, entering into new collaborations and in-licensing arrangements to foster inter-organizational collaboration and innovation, while continuously monitoring potential economic and market disruptions and adjusting our capital structure through debt and swaption facilities to hedge interest rate risks associated with our pending acquisition of Celgene. Our liquidity position, including cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and our commitment to monitor and limit inventory in distribution channels under the SEC consent order, together with ongoing evaluations of our capital structure, underpins our resilience by ensuring access to financial resources, mitigating external pressures and preserving operational continuity, even under internal or external variations and disturbances.

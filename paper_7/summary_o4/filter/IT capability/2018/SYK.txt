In its 2018 management’s discussion and analysis, Stryker Corporation emphasizes its capital allocation strategy—prioritizing acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases—and reports continued investments of $2,451 million in acquisitions, $703 million in dividends and $300 million in share repurchases, reflecting strategic resource deployment to maintain competitive positioning and business continuity; the company issued and repaid various senior unsecured notes throughout the year, demonstrating operational flexibility and proactive debt management. Stryker underscores its ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to access capital markets at competitive rates, with operating cash flow providing the primary source of funds for operating needs and capital expenditures, excess cash deployed first to acquisitions and supplemented as necessary by debt, illustrating a global cash management strategy that balances liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations. The company maintains debt levels assessed against cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans and overall cost of capital, and anticipates supporting short-term liquidity and operating needs through diverse sources—including cash from operations, commercial paper and existing credit facilities—while preserving strong investment-grade credit ratings and available borrowing capacity of $1,500 million under its main credit facility and $1,500 million under its commercial paper program, thereby ensuring funding flexibility for organic growth and acquisitions. Stryker reports no guarantees or off-balance sheet financing arrangements that could materially affect its financial condition or liquidity, and it records liabilities for probable losses on product recalls, regulatory matters and uncertain income tax positions based on best estimates, noting that actual outcomes may differ materially and could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The company’s investing activities reflect increased cash outflows for acquisitions—primarily the $697 million acquisition of Entellus and the $1,380 million acquisition of K2M—and its financing activities include higher net borrowings partially offset by increased share repurchases and dividends, signifying adaptive financing strategies. Stryker’s critical accounting policies involve significant judgments and estimates—such as inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, valuation and amortization of intangible assets, impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles and recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities—underscoring the firm’s focus on risk assessment, resource management and resilience to internal and external uncertainties. Excluding the impact of hurricanes, unfavorable mix and inflation, gross profit and adjusted expense leverage benefited from higher sales volumes, increased productivity and favorable foreign currency exchange, demonstrating maintenance of operational performance under challenging conditions.

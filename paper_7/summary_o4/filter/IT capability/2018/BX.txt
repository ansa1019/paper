Blackstone operates as one globally integrated business with investments in North America, Europe, Asia and Latin America and capitalizes on its scale and proprietary information advantages to invest with conviction and generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for its investors over the long term. The real estate investment team seeks to acquire high-quality, well-located yet undermanaged assets at an attractive basis, address any property or business issues through active asset management and sell assets once its business plan is accomplished. The tactical opportunities platform invests globally across asset classes, industries and geographies to identify and execute on differentiated opportunities, leveraging intellectual capital across businesses and continuously optimizing its approach in the face of ever-changing market conditions. Segment distributable earnings is used by management to make operating decisions, allocate resources and determine employee compensation across all business segments, and the firm manages its business using traditional financial measures and key operating metrics since it believes these metrics measure the productivity of its investment activities. Blackstone’s businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic environments worldwide, and while underlying fundamentals may remain positive, slower growth, increased volatility and trade disputes can contribute to adverse operating performance at portfolio companies and limit attractive realization opportunities. Despite facing pressure in 2018, oil prices and energy indices rebounded sharply in early 2019, exemplifying the firm’s ability to adapt to market swings and generate net investment gains driven by operating and strategic initiatives. The firm has multiple sources of liquidity—including cash generated from operating activities, performance allocations, realizations on carry and hedge fund investments, limited partner commitments and an amended $1.6 billion revolving credit facility maturing in 2023—and anticipates these sources will be sufficient to fund working capital and support growth initiatives. Blackstone may use leverage opportunistically to optimize its capital structure and employs a unit repurchase program to manage equity capital. Its distribution policy contemplates distributing approximately 85% of distributable earnings, subject to adjustment by management to provide for business conduct, appropriate investments, compliance with legal and debt instruments, and future cash requirements such as tax-related payments, clawback obligations and distributions to unitholders. The firm continuously assesses risk, valuation and potential clawback obligations, employing a multi-level governance and valuation process—including business-unit subcommittees, a firm-wide valuation committee and quarterly audit committee reviews—to maintain the integrity of its reporting and ensure performance metrics reflect fair value. Under scenarios of rising interest rates and economic slowdown, the combination of a predominantly floating-rate, short-duration portfolio and diversified investment platforms provides resilience, flexibility to reconfigure resources, mitigate risks and preserve or improve functioning despite external pressures and market disturbances.

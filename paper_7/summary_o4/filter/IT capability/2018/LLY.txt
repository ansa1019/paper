Management emphasizes an adaptive approach to funding and risk management by managing research and development spending across its molecule portfolio so that a delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in total R&D investment and by acknowledging that failure can occur at any point in the process—even after substantial investment—such that most funds invested will not generate financial returns; it bolsters its pipeline and enhances shareholder value through business development activities, including licensing arrangements, collaborations, acquisitions (such as LOXO), and divestiture strategies (including the planned exchange offer of Elanco shares), thereby reconfiguring resources and strengthening its strategic position; it responds to clinical setbacks by suspending promotion when trials do not confirm clinical benefit and by working with global regulators to determine appropriate next steps; it maintains liquidity to support normal operating needs through credit facilities, commercial paper markets, and cash generated from operations; and it implements a controlled risk-management program—including interest rate and foreign currency hedging and use of derivative financial instruments—to mitigate fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates, preserve operating flexibility, and limit the impact of external financial disturbances on earnings, all underpinned by forward-looking guidance to sustain performance under varying conditions.

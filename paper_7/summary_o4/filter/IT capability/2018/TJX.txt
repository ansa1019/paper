TJX’s MD&A highlights that its results are subject to “risks and uncertainties” and describes a variety of measures undertaken to absorb strain and preserve performance under adverse conditions. In addressing Brexit, the European management team “evaluated a range of possible outcomes, sought to identify areas of concern and implemented strategies to mitigate them,” including developing “a plan to realign our European division’s supply chain to reduce the volume of merchandise flowing between the U.K. and the EU” and “established resources and systems to support this plan,” while continuously communicating with associates about additional procedures that may be required post-Brexit. To mitigate foreign currency volatility, TJX “routinely enter[s] into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases,” recognizing mark-to-market adjustments that are offset upon receipt and payment of inventory. Ongoing investments in existing and new distribution centers are noted as a principal driver of higher supply chain costs and reflect strategic resource allocation to enhance operational flexibility and systemic resilience. In response to severe weather, the Company excluded stores “significantly impacted by hurricanes” from comparable store sales and will include them once they again meet comp criteria, demonstrating an adaptive approach to unforeseen disruptions. Liquidity is managed through cash, cash equivalents and credit facilities deemed “more than adequate to meet our operating needs,” and planned capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion for fiscal 2020—split among distribution centers, offices, store renovations and new store openings—underscore forward-oriented planning and capacity building. Additionally, pension obligations have been annuitized and transferred to insurance contracts, reducing benefit obligations without cash impact, and short-term investments have been liquidated through cash repatriation strategies that consider tax withholding to ensure sufficient financial resources are available, all in furtherance of preserving organizational integrity and performance under varying internal and external perturbations.

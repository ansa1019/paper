During fiscal 2018, we completed acquisitions of Marketo, Magento and Tubemogul and are continuing to integrate these businesses into our digital experience and digital media reportable segments to preserve operational continuity and enhance our strategic growth areas. In preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP and SEC rules, we base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, regularly evaluate and discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee, and establish reserves for income tax contingencies and other potential exposures to assess and mitigate risk and maintain system integrity and performance under varying conditions. We manage our unbilled deferred revenue backlog and adjust for factors such as billing cycles, customer renewals, contract durations and foreign currency fluctuations, acknowledging that backlog levels may not reliably predict future performance but must be monitored and reconfigured over time. Our primary sources of liquidity are operating cash flows, supplemented by a $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, a $2.25 billion term loan and $1.9 billion of senior notes, all subject to financial covenants we continuously monitor to ensure compliance and sufficient working capital to meet operating resource requirements under our current business plan. We employ interest rate swaps to convert fixed-rate debt into floating-rate exposure and maintain a currency hedging program to mitigate foreign exchange volatility on revenue, refining our liquidity forecasts to confront uncertainties and preserve organizational flexibility. During fiscal 2018, we recorded provisional tax estimates under SAB 118 in connection with the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, finalized our accounting analysis without material adjustments, elected to amortize the one-time transition tax over eight years and continue to evaluate the repatriation of foreign earnings to optimize our tax structure while safeguarding our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adverse events. We also enter into structured stock repurchase agreements only when the guaranteed discount to our volume-weighted average stock price exceeds our estimated foregone return on cash prepayments and indemnify our directors and officers—supported by insurance coverage—to limit contingent liabilities and reinforce our capacity to respond effectively to internal and external pressures.

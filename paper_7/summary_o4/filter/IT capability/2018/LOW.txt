During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the company undertook a comprehensive strategic reassessment, established a new leadership team and developed action plans to improve performance, in-stock levels and customer experience, sharpen its focus on retail fundamentals, align decision-making and execution, and concentrate on its core home improvement business; as part of this effort it rationalized store inventory to remove less productive SKUs, invested in top-selling items in job-lot quantities for its pro customer and exited non-core or under-performing assets—including all Orchard Supply Hardware locations, 20 under-performing U.S. stores, 31 Canadian stores and locations, certain non-core U.S. activities and its Mexican retail operations—and eliminated the Project Specialists Interiors position, incurring related impairment, severance and lease charges.  These measures were described as building a sustainable foundation for long-term success by positioning the organization to absorb strain, preserve functioning and emerge stronger under adverse market conditions.  As it transitioned into 2019, management articulated a four-pillar resilience strategy—driving merchandising excellence through improved productivity, localization, reset execution and digital experiences; transforming the supply chain by advancing fulfillment, delivery capabilities and operational excellence; delivering operational efficiency via simplified store operations and enhanced in-stock execution; and intensifying customer engagement by focusing on competitive pricing, stock availability, brand and service differentiation for the pro customer—to enhance adaptability, resource reconfiguration and risk mitigation, maintain operational continuity and system integrity amid environmental perturbations and disturbances, and support long-term resource deployment, organizational flexibility and performance maintenance in a turbulent retail environment.  Additionally, ongoing reviews of long-lived asset recoverability, goodwill impairment testing (including a $952 million Canadian goodwill write-down), self-insurance accruals for workers’ compensation and liability claims, and adjustments to accounting classifications for shipping and handling costs demonstrate sustained risk assessment, mitigation and financial reporting adaptations to preserve organizational health under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

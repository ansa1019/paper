The company’s management uses adjusted earnings, excluding the impact of non-qualifying hedge activity and other volatile items, for financial planning, performance analysis, board reporting and performance-based compensation to provide a more meaningful representation of fundamental earnings power and to mitigate period-to-period volatility arising from external pressures such as fluctuations in forward power and natural gas prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. FPL’s use of reserve amortization, permitted under its 2012 and 2016 rate agreements, to offset nearly all of the 2017 hurricane Irma storm restoration costs—combined with its plan to partially restore that amortization through regulatory tax savings—illustrates adaptive measures to preserve operational continuity and maintain regulatory return metrics in the face of extreme weather events. To support and grow its businesses, NEE and its subsidiaries secure funding through operating cash flows, borrowings, issuances of debt and equity, proceeds from differential membership investors and asset dispositions, relying on continued access to credit and capital markets; credit rating maintenance and associated collateral requirements under revolving credit and guarantee arrangements are identified as critical factors influencing liquidity, cost of capital and risk mitigation. Subsidiary entities issue guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds to enable commercial and trading activities—including power and gas procurement and marketing—and master netting agreements and other credit enhancements are employed to manage counterparty credit risk. Regulatory assets and liabilities reflect expected recoveries or refunds of costs, ensuring ratebase integrity and financial resilience under cost-based rate regulation. Derivative instruments are measured at fair value and used to hedge commodity price, interest rate and foreign currency exposures, with market risk monitored via value-at-risk models and regulatory deferral mechanisms that defer mark-to-market impacts until contract settlement. The company recognizes asset retirement obligations for nuclear decommissioning and fossil plant dismantlement over the assets’ service lives, funding anticipated restoration costs through special use funds invested in fixed-income and equity securities, and periodically reviews escalation and discount rate assumptions to preserve system integrity under a range of future scenarios. The defined benefit pension plan’s well-funded status and actuarial assumptions—covering discount rates, compensation increases and expected long-term returns—are evaluated annually to maintain workforce sustainability. Capital covenants governing first mortgage bonds and junior subordinated debentures, including replacement capital tests and adjusted net earnings requirements, further constrain financing flexibility, ensuring that issuances of equity-like securities are aligned with targeted capital structures and safeguarding the firm’s capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adverse conditions.

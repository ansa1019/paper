The discussion highlights our ongoing efforts to anticipate and adapt to volatile economic and geopolitical conditions by continuously monitoring uncertainty and implementing cost-management actions to maintain operational flexibility and preserve performance under pressure. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce—hiring to meet current and projected demand, evaluating voluntary attrition, adjusting hiring levels, and, when necessary, using involuntary terminations—to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand, while adjusting compensation in key skill sets and geographies to attract and retain qualified employees. We seek to mitigate the impact of rising labor costs on our gross margin by adjusting pricing and the mix of resources, and we manage foreign currency exposure through currency protection provisions in customer contracts and hedging programs, thereby preserving our cost structure amid exchange-rate fluctuations. Through these measures—together with our ability to access cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and committed borrowing facilities to satisfy working capital and funding requirements—we maintain the capacity to respond effectively to changing conditions, reconfigure resources as needed and sustain performance in the face of external pressures.

S&P Global emphasizes organizational resilience through disciplined resource allocation and operational flexibility, maintaining a strong financial position with cash on hand, cash flows from operations and a committed credit facility expected to meet future operating and recurring cash needs, while deploying capital for ongoing investments, strategic acquisitions (including Kensho, Panjiva and RateWatch), disciplined dispositions of non-core assets and share repurchase programs to create capacity for mid- to long-term revenue growth. The company’s strategic priorities—delivering revenue growth and EBITDA margin targets, returning capital to shareholders and pursuing disciplined acquisition, investment and partnership strategies—are designed to preserve and enhance functioning under external pressures and market volatility. Operational resilience is fostered by transforming technology infrastructure to support growth, improve cost efficiency and mitigate cyber risk; adopting enterprise-wide management systems, tools and processes to improve prioritization, agility and execution and reduce complexity; and developing an enterprise-wide data strategy leveraging machine learning and data science. A high-performance culture driven by best-in-class talent, continuous innovation, operational excellence and a robust risk, internal control and compliance framework further supports the maintenance of performance under challenging conditions, while adaptations in segment reporting and the implementation of ASC 606 illustrate the firm’s capacity to reconfigure trajectories and sustain integrity and performance in response to evolving regulatory and accounting environments.

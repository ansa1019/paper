Within our integrated ecosystem, our products are designed to decrease variability in surgery by offering dependable, consistent functionality and user experiences, and we take a holistic systems approach—evidenced by the measured rollout of the da Vinci SP surgical system in the hands of experienced users while we optimize training pathways and our supply chain—to enhance operational flexibility and mitigate risks under challenging conditions. Our commercial model, which includes sales-type and operating lease arrangements recognized on a straight-line basis or by system usage, provides customers with flexible acquisition options, generates recurring revenue, and spreads resource deployment, although credit risks may increase if customers are affected by changes in healthcare laws, reimbursement, economic pressures or uncertainty, and usage-based leases with no minimum payments may allow exit without penalty. We focus our organization and investments on developing, marketing, and training products and services for procedures where da Vinci can deliver superior patient value and economic benefit, driving adoption procedure by procedure, market by market, and adapt our product portfolio—from advanced stapler and vessel sealer offerings to single-site and fourth-generation platforms—to evolving clinical and economic needs. Regulatory and field actions to correct or remove devices for safety or compliance can adversely affect our reputation, revenue and use of installed systems; accordingly, we notify affected customers, provide required documentation in local languages, and arrange field service visits or replacements to preserve business continuity. Future demand will be influenced by external pressures including healthcare policy shifts, hospital consolidation trends, governmental tenders and authorizations, competitive dynamics, and broader economic and geopolitical factors, and we model seasonal variations aligned with customer budgeting cycles to manage system placements. To maintain financial resilience, we believe cash generated by operations, together with our cash, cash equivalents, and investment balances, will meet our liquidity requirements beyond one year, and we intend to fund anticipated capital investments—projected to exceed $250 million annually over the next two years—from these resources. Our 60/40 joint venture with Fosun Pharma to research, develop, manufacture, and distribute robotic-assisted catheter-based medical devices further extends our strategic capabilities, while selective repatriation and reinvestment of foreign earnings optimize our tax posture and reinforce our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity.

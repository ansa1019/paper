We invest in the development of our services, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth and support operational flexibility. Our software-as-a-service is delivered via a consumer-product-like interface that can be easily configured and rapidly deployed, enabling business continuity and adaptive responses to customer needs. Subscription services are offered on an annual fee basis, with pricing determined by subscription term, volume, product mix and discounts, fostering predictable resource allocation and cash-flow planning. We generally bill customers annually in advance for subscriptions and monthly in arrears for professional services, balancing revenue recognition with real-time delivery of services. We continue to expand data center capacity, infrastructure hardware and technical support to scale with increased customer usage, leveraging economies of scale to improve subscription gross margin and preserve performance under growing demand. To mitigate foreign exchange risk, we initiated a hedging program using currency derivative contracts to hedge net monetary assets and liabilities, reflecting a systemic approach to risk management. Incremental selling costs, including sales commissions and referral fees, are capitalized and amortized over expected contract life spans to align expense recognition with long-term contract benefits. We expect absolute growth in subscription revenues, cost of subscription revenues, sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses as we expand our customer base, data centers and workforce, while these expenses remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues, demonstrating operational scalability and strategic resilience. We maintain principal sources of liquidity—$1.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, $581.9 million in long-term investments and cash generated from operations—which we anticipate will be sufficient to meet obligations such as convertible note repayments, data center expansion, lease commitments, headcount growth and fixed-asset acquisitions for at least the next twelve months, yet we may seek additional equity or debt financing if required to support organizational continuity. Our net cash provided by operating activities of $811.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, driven by reduced net loss and favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities, and reduced net cash used in investing activities of $347.4 million versus $883.9 million in the prior year, illustrate adaptive resource management. We regularly review contractual obligations, including non-cancelable operating leases and purchase commitments, and maintain a full valuation allowance on U.S. and certain foreign deferred tax assets based on projected earnings, market trends and available evidence, underscoring prudent risk assessment and organizational foresight. Our critical accounting policies for revenue recognition, deferred commission capitalization, business combinations, long-lived asset impairment, stock-based compensation and income taxes require significant judgments to ensure accurate measurement and transparent reporting, thereby preserving system integrity and resilience under varying internal and external conditions.

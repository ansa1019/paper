Applied’s MD&A does not explicitly use the term “organizational resilience,” but it describes a range of practices and capabilities that support the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. It acknowledges that each of its businesses is subject to variable industry conditions, significant changes in customer requirements, and uneven demand patterns that can cause quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year fluctuations, and it states that “in light of these conditions, Applied’s results can vary significantly year-over-year, as well as quarter-over-quarter.” To address these external pressures and preserve functioning, Applied’s strategic priorities include developing products that help solve customers’ challenges at technology inflections, expanding served market opportunities in the semiconductor and display industries, and growing its services business. Its long-term growth strategy requires continued development of new materials engineering capabilities and significant investments in research, development and engineering to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand, thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing plans during early-stage technology selection. Applied works closely with its global customers to design systems and processes that meet planned technical and production requirements, and its Applied Global Services segment provides integrated solutions—spares, upgrades, services, certain remanufactured earlier-generation equipment and factory automation software—to optimize equipment and fab performance and productivity, shorten ramp times, improve device performance and yield, and optimize factory output and operating costs. Applied also describes management of operational flexibility and business continuity through agreements to sell accounts receivable without recourse and to discount letters of credit, detailed monitoring of working capital components such as days sales outstanding (58 days at fiscal 2018 end), maintenance of $5.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments, availability of $1.5 billion of committed revolving credit facilities, compliance with debt covenants on $5.4 billion of senior unsecured notes, and the belief that “cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to satisfy Applied’s liquidity requirements for the next 12 months.” The company further demonstrates adaptive capital allocation through multibillion-dollar common stock repurchase programs, quarterly cash dividend declarations, and proactive responses to regulatory changes such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and recognition of transition tax expense, all of which together illustrate a systemic perspective on risk assessment, resource deployment and the ability to preserve or improve functioning despite market volatility, technological transitions, regulatory changes and other adversities.

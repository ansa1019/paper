AbbVie leverages its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies addressing complex and serious diseases, underpinning business continuity through pipeline diversification and strong commercial execution of new product launches. The company’s strategy focuses on delivering strong financial results, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term, achieved through diversifying revenue streams, driving late-stage pipeline assets to market and expanding operating margins via continued leverage from revenue growth, reduction of Humira royalty expense, productivity initiatives in supply chain and efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses. AbbVie maintains operational flexibility and financial resilience by managing Humira international biosimilar erosion, pursuing productivity initiatives, refinancing through revolving credit and term loan arrangements, issuing commercial paper and senior notes, repurchasing shares under an open-market program and adjusting dividends, thereby ensuring compliance with credit facility covenants and sufficient liquidity to meet obligations as they arise. The company monitors economic conditions, customer creditworthiness and government funding, establishes allowances against accounts receivable when collection is uncertain and may utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, demonstrating risk assessment and mitigation practices to preserve cash flow. AbbVie’s collaboration networks and milestone-based R&D partnerships, including contingent consideration arrangements, enable resource allocation to promising clinical programs, while annual impairment testing and fair value remeasurement of intangible assets, goodwill and contingent liabilities reflect the firm’s ability to absorb strain and maintain or improve functioning under internal and external variations.

We have historically demonstrated the ability to adapt our operations and preserve performance under adverse or variable conditions by adjusting our pricing, merchandise mix and private‚Äêlabel penetration, expanding e-commerce offerings and opening new warehouses in existing and international markets, thereby absorbing environmental perturbations such as fluctuations in currency exchange rates, gasoline prices and competitive pressures. Our philosophy of maintaining above-average compensation levels to reduce employee turnover and enhance satisfaction, together with targeted investments in information systems modernization, centralized return centers and preopening startup operations, supports both operational flexibility and continuity. We manage risk through self-insurance via a captive subsidiary and reinsurance programs, maintain bank credit and commercial paper facilities with unused capacity, and rely on cash flows from operations, short-term investments and deferred membership fee revenues to meet liquidity and capital requirements. This integrated approach to resource allocation, cost control and proactive planning reflects a systemic perspective on preserving integrity and sustaining performance amid internal or external variations.

Merckâ€™s performance during 2018 demonstrates execution of its innovation strategy, with revenue growth in oncology, vaccines, hospital acute care and animal health, focused investment in the research and development pipeline, and disciplined allocation of resources. The company completed several business development transactions, expanded its capital expenditures program primarily to increase future manufacturing capacity, and returned capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, while augmenting its portfolio and pipeline with external innovation as an important component of its overall strategy. In addition, the company is allocating resources to effectively support its commercial opportunities in the near term while making the necessary investments to support long-term growth. On June 27, 2017, Merck experienced a network cyber-attack that disrupted its worldwide operations, including manufacturing, research and sales operations; in response, it recorded manufacturing-related expenses, unfavorable variances in cost of sales, remediation efforts in selling, general and administrative and research and development expenses, relied on insurance coverage and addressed disputes with certain insurers. The company has executed global restructuring programs designed to streamline its cost structure through the elimination of positions, the sale or closure of manufacturing and research and development sites and the consolidation of office facilities, and recorded associated restructuring costs. Merck employs revenue hedging, balance sheet risk management and net investment hedging programs to mitigate variability caused by changes in foreign exchange rates, as well as interest rate swap contracts to manage exposure to interest rate changes. It maintains a conservative financial profile by placing cash and investments in high-credit-quality instruments, maintaining a $6.0 billion credit facility for backup liquidity and avoiding off-balance-sheet arrangements. In October 2018, the board approved a 15% increase to the quarterly dividend and authorized $10 billion of treasury stock purchases, including $5 billion of accelerated share repurchase agreements, reflecting strategic allocation of financial resources.

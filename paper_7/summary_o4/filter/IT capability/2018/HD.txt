In our liquidity and capital resources discussion, we disclosed that at February 3, 2019 we held $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which $1.4 billion was held by foreign subsidiaries, and stated our belief that this cash position, combined with access to long-term debt capital markets, funds available under $3.0 billion of commercial paper programs, back-up credit facilities, derivative instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate exposure, and cash flow generated from operations should not only meet our operating requirements but also fund capital expenditure programs of approximately $2.7 billion, dividend payments, share repurchases and required long-term debt payments over the next several fiscal years, while noting our ability to obtain alternative sources of financing. We described our use of capital and operating leases to finance real estate assets and our quarterly evaluations for impairment of long-lived assets, comparing carrying values to undiscounted future cash flows based on assumptions about sales growth, operating margins, economic conditions and competition to ensure asset recoverability. We outlined our establishment of liabilities for self-insured general liability, workersâ€™ compensation, employee medical and automobile claims based on historical data and actuarial estimates, acknowledging that deviations in claim frequency, severity or medical cost inflation could affect our results. Under our revenue recognition policy, we defer revenue and related gross profit until customer performance obligations are satisfied, estimate sales return liabilities and associated return assets using historical return levels, and recognize that significant variances in these estimates could materially impact net sales and gross profit. We also explained that vendor allowances, including volume rebates and co-op advertising reimbursements, are accrued over incentive periods based on expected purchase volumes and recorded as reductions of merchandise inventories, cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expense as appropriate. Collectively, these disclosures describe the financial resources, risk mitigation processes and operational controls we employ to absorb strain, preserve or improve our functioning under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions and maintain business continuity.

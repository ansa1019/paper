Management reported that “operating fundamentals remained strong for our O&M portfolio” with year-end 2018 occupancy of 97.5% and confirmed it “saw no signs of slowness based on our operating metrics” while remaining “positive on our outlook”; however, “given the current market volatility caused by current trade and tariff disputes and uncertainty with regard to the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union, we will continue to be prudent in running our business,” reflecting adaptive strategies and operational continuity under external pressures. The company extended its debt maturities to 76 months and lowered its weighted-average interest rate to 2.7% through strategic refinancing and generated net proceeds of $2.8 billion from dispositions and contributions to unconsolidated co-investment ventures, thereby reallocating resources toward “the highest-quality properties in the best markets” and mitigating financial risk. Management affirmed that its ability to generate cash from operating activities, co-investment venture distributions, property contributions and dispositions, and $3.4 billion of available credit (increased to $3.9 billion in January 2019) is “adequate to meet our anticipated future development, acquisition, operating, debt service, dividend and distribution requirements,” demonstrating liquidity resilience. Near-term capital requirements for completion of 100 development properties (50.8% leased, $3.6 billion TEI), new development starts, operating portfolio capital expenditures, equity commitments to co-investment ventures, acquisitions of operating properties and potential debt or equity repurchases illustrate proactive resource deployment and strategic foresight. In its capacity as sponsor and manager, the company “works with the co-investment ventures to maintain sufficient liquidity and refinance their maturing debt,” underscoring inter-organizational collaboration to preserve system integrity and prevent portfolio brittleness, while continued compliance with financial covenants and disciplined equity commitments (€1,421 million and £622 million) uphold organizational robustness amid environmental turbulence.

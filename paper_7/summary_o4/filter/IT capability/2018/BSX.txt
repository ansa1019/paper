Effective January 1, 2018, we undertook organizational changes to align our business structure with our focus on active implantable devices and revised our reportable segments accordingly, reflecting a strategic reconfiguration of resources to preserve continuity and improve functioning under shifting market conditions.  Our process improvement and global restructuring programs, including the 2019 restructuring plan approved in November 2018, are designed to absorb strain and enhance operational flexibility by reducing annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately $100 million to $150 million by the end of 2022, with a substantial portion of savings reinvested in strategic growth initiatives.  We remain committed to advancing medical technologies through sustained investment in research and development across all business units to maintain a resilient pipeline of new products that can confront unexpected disruptions and support future orientation.  In support of business continuity and risk mitigation, we invest excess cash in short-term diversified instruments, limit our exposure to any single industry or issuer, and maintain access to a $2.75 billion commercial paper program, revolving credit and bridge facilities, as well as delayed draw term loans, ensuring sufficient liquidity to fund operations, infrastructure investments, legal liabilities, tax obligations, acquisitions and debt service under both nominal and extreme conditions.  As part of our strategic imperatives to drive global expansion, we have increased investment in infrastructure in emerging markets—defined as 20 countries with strong growth potential—thereby enhancing our absorptive capacity and systemic resilience in diverse economic and healthcare environments.  Our targeted end-to-end business process streamlining and automation, including expansion of global shared services and robotic process utilization, has driven manufacturing cost reductions and improved gross profit margins, partially offsetting headwinds from foreign currency fluctuations.  We manage uncertainties arising from inventory obsolescence, contingent consideration obligations and intangible asset valuations through rigorous fair-value measurement, periodic impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets and accrual of legal and product liability reserves based on probative factors, thereby maintaining system integrity and the ability to reconfigure our financial and operational posture as conditions evolve.  Resolution of significant tax audits and transfer pricing disputes in 2018, resulting in net tax benefits of $340 million, underscores our capacity to absorb external pressures and preserve financial stability.  Our internal control framework, including robust revenue recognition, deferred revenue and reserve methodologies, and adherence to a territory-based tax regime, further underpins our ability to foresee, confront and benefit from sudden disruptive change, sustaining organizational health, performance maintenance and the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

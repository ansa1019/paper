In 2018, Marsh & McLennan maintained robust liquidity and resource allocation by regularly repatriating funds from non-U.S. subsidiaries, securing bridge financing for its pending JLT acquisition, issuing senior notes and entering into deal-contingent foreign exchange and treasury lock contracts to hedge currency and interest-rate exposures, while its Marsh simplification initiative streamlined management layers and standardized regional structures to generate efficiencies and create additional capacity for reinvestment in people and technology. Mercer reconfigured its retirement and investment businesses into a unified wealth segment to better align client strategy and enhance service innovation, and the firmâ€™s adoption of the new revenue recognition standard shifted income among quarters but did not materially affect annual revenue, demonstrating resilience to regulatory perturbations. The risk and insurance services segment completed multiple acquisitions to reinforce capabilities and diversify risk, and management employs case-level legal reviews, actuarial modeling and quarterly adjustments to estimate and provision for errors and omissions losses, reflecting a systemic risk-assessment and mitigation framework. Defined benefit pension and post-retirement plans are governed by ERISA guidelines and negotiated U.K. deficit-recovery arrangements, with ongoing contributions and actuarial assumptions designed to preserve plan integrity under market volatility, and the company maintains substantial undrawn credit facilities and a short-term commercial paper program to ensure operational flexibility and business continuity. Across its global network of more than 65,000 professionals in 130 countries, the firm has demonstrated the ability to adapt governance structures, reconfigure segment operations, deploy financial and human capital, and maintain performance under pressure from acquisitions, accounting changes and external market disruptions, consistent with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

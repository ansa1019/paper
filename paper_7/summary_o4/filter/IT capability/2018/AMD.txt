In its management’s discussion and analysis, the Company highlights strategic initiatives and resource allocations that support its ability to absorb strain and maintain or improve functioning under internal or external disturbances. The 2018 financial results demonstrate strong product roadmap execution and significant expansion of processor offerings, with new products accounting for over 65% of revenue and research and development expenses increasing by 20% to $1.4 billion, reflecting investment in innovation and adaptability to customer needs. In response to the adoption of new revenue standards, the Company adjusted its recognition policy to shipment-based recognition and established provisions for rights of return and price protection, underscoring risk mitigation measures and operational flexibility. Inventory valuation practices involve ongoing assessment of projected demand, market conditions and product life cycles to manage obsolescence and preserve performance. Goodwill impairment analyses incorporate qualitative and quantitative factors, including projected cash flows and market considerations, to assess reporting unit integrity. The Company manages liquidity risk through $1.16 billion of cash, equivalents and marketable securities, a $500 million secured revolving credit facility bearing commitment and covenant terms, and periodic debt repurchases with make-whole premiums, enabling business continuity and strategic financing flexibility. Operating cash flows of $34 million in 2018 were driven by higher cash collections and working capital management amid seasonal revenue fluctuations, while capital expenditures and long-term operating leases through 2028 ensure continuity of facilities and support future growth. Amendments to minimum wafer purchase obligations with GF and optional redemptions of senior notes reflect contractual adaptability and strategic agility. Tax strategies, including assessment of deferred tax asset recoverability, prudence in valuation allowances and election of the period cost method for GILTI provisions, further reinforce the firm’s capacity to respond to regulatory changes and adverse conditions, thereby sustaining its organizational resilience.

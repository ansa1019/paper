In its MD&A, Amgen describes a set of integrated activities intended to maintain and strengthen its competitive position in the industry, including transformation and process improvement efforts that commit to a more agile and efficient operating model and have realized approximately $1.9 billion of net savings, which have been reinvested in product launches, clinical programs and external business development. These measures have enabled the reallocation of resources to fund innovative pipeline and growth opportunities, supported the launch of next-generation biomanufacturing plants with smaller footprints and reliable, high-quality compliant supply of medicines, and expanded manufacturing capabilities in Rhode Island and Singapore. The company emphasizes business continuity and liquidity management through global access to $29.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, the maintenance of a $2.5 billion syndicated unsecured revolving credit facility as a backstop to its commercial paper program, and the use of interest rate and cross-currency swap contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks, thereby preserving financial flexibility under external variations. Operating cash flows increased due to improvements in working capital, and productivity initiatives were established to enable investment in new products and the defense of existing products, optimizing long- and short-term growth under pricing and regulatory pressures. Amgen further invests in both internal and external innovation, advancing its pipeline of first-in-class molecules, branded biosimilars and genetically related targets, acquiring or collaborating on therapies to mitigate potential revenue losses from patent expirations, and strengthening its competitive resilience. The companyâ€™s strategic capital allocation prioritizes dividends, stock repurchases, debt repayment and strategic transactions to ensure adequate funding for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, and strategic pursuits, reflecting a systemic resilience strategy designed to absorb strain, maintain integrity of operations and performance, and emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

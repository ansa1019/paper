Schwab has established an enterprise risk management framework, approved by its board and executed by senior management and specialized risk committees, to identify, assess, measure, monitor and mitigate operational, credit, market, liquidity and compliance risks in pursuit of its corporate strategy. Under defined risk appetite and tolerance levels, the firm employs policies and procedures supported by periodic control testing, model governance, scenario and stress testing, and reporting mechanisms to ensure accountability at all hierarchical levels. Operational resilience is enabled through a geographically dispersed workforce, backup and recovery infrastructure, routine business continuity and disaster-recovery plan testing and an incident management program, together with a comprehensive information security program that leverages advanced monitoring, authentication controls and employee training to protect against unauthorized access or disruptions. Third-party risk management, including contractual provisions and ongoing performance monitoring, further reinforces system integrity. Market and liquidity resilience is maintained by net-interest-revenue simulation modeling, active duration management of interest-earning assets and liabilities, diversified funding sources, contingency funding scenarios, committed credit facilities and periodic discount-window testing, and ongoing liquidity coverage ratio monitoring. Capital resilience is preserved via internal guidelines to remain well capitalized under stressed scenarios, regular capital stress testing, rolling capital forecasts, proactive capital contingency planning, and maintenance of regulatory capital and leverage ratios above required thresholds. Collectively, these strategic, structural and procedural measures enable the organization to absorb strain, preserve or improve its functioning under internal and external variations or disturbances, and to position itself to emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

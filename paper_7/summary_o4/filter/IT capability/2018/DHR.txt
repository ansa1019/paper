Danaher’s management highlights that as “a diversified, global business,” its geographic and industry diversity, together with the breadth of its products, software and services, help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on consolidated operating results, illustrating an ability to absorb external pressures and maintain functioning under varying conditions. The company monitors general economic trends and key competitors to gauge relative performance and outlook, makes significant investments—both organically and through acquisitions—to address the rapid pace of technological development and to globalize manufacturing, R&D and customer-facing resources in high-growth markets, and focuses on developing innovative, differentiated products and services, continuing productivity improvement initiatives and cost-control measures to improve operating efficiency, quality and margins. Danaher’s approach to liquidity and capital resources centers on generating substantial operating cash flows, maintaining access to financing via commercial paper and credit facilities, and managing its capital structure through strategic debt issuance and repayment, share repurchases and dividend payments to support acquisitions, capital expenditures and other strategic initiatives, thereby preserving financial flexibility and resilience. The company employs derivative instruments to manage interest rate, currency exchange and commodity price risks while leveraging its broad-based business activities to reduce volatility in any particular area, and continuously reviews contractual obligations, reserves for environmental, legal and tax contingencies, and deferred tax assets and liabilities in light of global tax reform, Brexit and regulatory changes—all aimed at preserving organizational health and sustaining performance under challenging or unexpected conditions.

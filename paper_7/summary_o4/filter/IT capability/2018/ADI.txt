The company reports that it “monitor[s] global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis and continue[s] to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency, as well as a better alignment of expenses with revenues,” leading to “various restructuring actions” including consolidation of wafer and test facility operations, closure of certain facilities, transfer of production to other internal sites and external foundries, and transition of testing operations to alternative locations and outsourced partners—measures expected to yield approximately $60 million in annual savings once implemented. It maintains cash and cash equivalents in “highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less,” continually monitors credit exposure and diversifies investments to minimize credit risk, and believes that its existing liquidity and anticipated long-term financing will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development and dividend payments for at least the next twelve months. In connection with the acquisition of Linear Technology, the company entered into and subsequently repaid bridge and term loan facilities, while also maintaining a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility with covenants to preserve funding flexibility and compliance. The temporary suspension and reinstatement of its common stock repurchase program—with $2.6 billion remaining authorized—together with planned capital expenditures of approximately 4 percent of 2019 revenue and a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share (subject to board determination based on financial performance, outlook and liquidity), reflect strategic agility and resource allocation in response to changing conditions. The company has elected to pay the one-time transition tax “over a period of eight years on an interest free basis,” further illustrating future-oriented financial planning. Its revenue recognition policies—deferring revenue and related cost of sales on shipments to certain distributors until end-customer sale to address uncertainties around price-adjustment credits and returns—and its lower-of-cost-or-market inventory valuation process demonstrate risk mitigation practices in revenue and inventory management. Additionally, the company applies percentage-of-completion accounting for government contracts, conducts periodic impairment testing of long-lived assets and goodwill, and relies on significant estimates and judgments in its critical accounting policies, all of which serve to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite internal and external variations.

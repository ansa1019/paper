Management acknowledges operating in an environment characterized by both complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures, and accordingly makes strategic investments in program execution, technology innovation and workforce technical skills to maintain the quality, predictability and affordability of its products and services. Recognizing that customers are resource-constrained, the company continuously shapes its portfolio through disciplined research and development, targeted acquisitions, divestitures and internal realignments to strengthen core capabilities, extend into adjacent markets, reconfigure resources, and sustain business continuity. It routinely conducts strategic reviews, evaluates acquisition, divestiture and equity investment opportunities, and undertakes organizational restructuring and realignments—such as the consolidation of the AWE joint venture and severance and asset impairment actions in the RMS segment—to better align cost structure with changing economic conditions and improve the efficiency and flexibility of operations. The company monitors key programs—such as F-35, EADGE-T, satellite development and Warrior Capability Sustainment—for performance, risk retirements and potential losses, establishing reserves and adjusting profit booking rates when necessary to mitigate risk, preserve performance under pressure and maintain integrity of ongoing contracts. A balanced cash deployment strategy—highlighted by investments in independent R&D, capital expenditures, pension plan contributions, and disciplined use of commercial paper and revolving credit facilities—supports liquidity, operational continuity and resilience, while hedge programs for foreign exchange and interest rate risk and environmental remediation provisions under FAR regulations further bolster adaptability to external pressures and compliance requirements. The company’s pension plan freeze actions, buy-in and buy-out annuity contracts, postretirement benefit funding aligned with CAS harmonization, and annual impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets reflect proactive resource reconfiguration, risk assessment and strategic foresight to sustain financial health, system integrity and capacity to absorb strain and maintain performance despite adverse conditions.

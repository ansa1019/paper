Through the Consumer Direct Offense realignment announced in June 2017, Nike reorganized its global operating structure to better serve consumers personally at scale by leveraging digital platforms to accelerate innovation and product creation, move closer to key cities and deepen one-to-one connections. Beginning in fiscal 2018, this organizational realignment resulted in new reportable segments—North America; Europe, Middle East & Africa; Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America—and the launch of a “triple double” strategy aimed at doubling the impact of innovation, increasing speed to market and growing direct consumer connections. Nike’s continued investments in digital capabilities, enhanced consumer experiences and product and brand marketing represent strategic resource allocation to support long-term growth and profitability under this alignment. In response to volatile foreign currency markets, the company’s centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program—including a foreign currency adjustment program with key suppliers and the Nike Trading Company sourcing hub—uses natural offsets, standard rates, forward contracts and options to mitigate transaction, translation and embedded derivative exposures and preserve gross margins and operational continuity. Liquidity and capital resilience are maintained through a committed $2 billion credit facility, a commercial paper program, substantial cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and an active shelf registration for debt securities, ensuring access to funding under varying market conditions. Supply chain and facility resilience are reinforced by legally binding purchase obligations, build-to-suit lease arrangements and endorsement contracts with performance incentives and minimum guarantees. Nike’s risk framework extends to legal contingencies, uncertainty in tax positions and critical accounting policies—such as deferred tax valuation allowances, inventory reserves and allowances for doubtful receivables—to ensure accurate financial reporting and adaptive decision-making. Planned infrastructure investments in corporate facilities, digital platforms and new Nike Direct stores at 3–4 percent of revenues annually illustrate the company’s strategic foresight, agility and capacity to absorb strain, adapt to market disruptions and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions.

NextEra Energy’s MD&A discloses a range of strategies and capabilities that support its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity, including the use of diversified funding sources—cash flows from operations, borrowings under committed credit facilities and equity issuances—to ensure ongoing liquidity and business continuity; guarantee agreements and letters of credit to secure subsidiary obligations and maintain access to capital markets; regulatory frameworks that permit deferment and recovery of storm-restoration costs and mark-to-market energy derivative impacts through cost-recovery clauses; systematic risk mitigation through commodity price hedging using swaps, options and forwards, value-at-risk modeling, master netting agreements and interest-rate contracts to manage debt exposure; credit-risk controls employing counterparty limits, collateral requirements and guarantees; compliance with financial covenants on funded-debt-to-capitalization ratios to preserve operational flexibility; regulatory accounting that establishes assets and liabilities to stabilize future revenues; capital initiatives such as modernization of generation assets and development of solar and pipeline projects to reconfigure resources toward long-term performance; and the establishment and monitoring of nuclear decommissioning and asset retirement obligations through dedicated reserve funds, all of which collectively illustrate a systemic perspective on risk assessment, resource allocation, adaptation to environmental and financial disruptions and maintenance of organizational integrity under challenging conditions.

The Company’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis underscores a deep commitment to continuously improving its business and affirms that it is “well positioned to appropriately address” a range of external pressures—including obesity, water quality and quantity challenges, evolving consumer preferences, increased competition, product safety and quality demands and food security risks—through targeted programs and collaborations that draw on its internal knowledge and resources.  Its water stewardship initiative “regularly assesses the specific water-related risks” faced by the Company and its bottling partners, implements “a formal water risk management program,” improves water use efficiency, treats wastewater and seeks to “replenish the water” it sources; its integrated quality management program “identifies and mitigates risks and drives improvement” across the supply chain, enforces rigorous safety and governance standards and continually refines requirements.  In marketing and distribution, the Company works with bottling partners to “identify processes that enable us to quickly achieve scale and efficiencies, and we share best practices throughout the bottling system,” participates in joint brand-building initiatives to “embed ourselves further into our retail customers’ businesses,” and invests in innovative packaging, merchandising and consumer communications to meet always-changing needs—efforts that reflect a systemic perspective, organizational learning and dynamic capabilities.  Financially, the Company highlights its ability to generate substantial cash flows from operating activities, its maintenance of significant liquidity through global cash balances, short- and long-term debt, commercial paper programs and committed credit facilities, and its foreign currency management and hedging strategies designed to mitigate exchange-rate volatility—measures that preserve and, where possible, improve functioning under internal and external variations.  Taken together, these strategic initiatives, resource allocations and risk-mitigation mechanisms illustrate the Company’s capacity for positive adjustment under challenging conditions, its ability to absorb strain and maintain integrity, and its ongoing transformation to emerge stronger from disruptive events.

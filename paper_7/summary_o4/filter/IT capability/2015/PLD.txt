Management’s discussion asserts that the scale and quality of the company’s operating platform, the skills of its team and the strength of its balance sheet confer unique competitive advantages and underpin its capacity to adapt to external pressures, maintain business continuity and preserve operational integrity. The firm’s plan to grow revenue, net operating income, cash flows and core FFO is supported by rising market rents across global markets and positive rent change on rollovers every quarter since 2012, demonstrating its ability to absorb strain and improve functioning through strategic resource reconfiguration and operational flexibility. Value creation from development is achieved by maintaining control of well-positioned land within a land bank capable of supporting more than 154 million additional square feet of industrial space, which is anticipated to realize a 32 percent value uplift through development and nonstrategic land dispositions, reflecting purposeful reconstitution of assets. Economies of scale from growth in assets under management, coupled with minimal increases in general and administrative expenses following the KTR acquisition and the consolidation of co-investment ventures, exemplify a systemic perspective and coherent deployment of resources. The use of straight-line revenue recognition, hedging of foreign currency exchange exposures through debt and derivative instruments, and same-store analyses to remove nonrecurring items mitigate the effects of currency fluctuations and temporal variations, sustaining consistent performance. A diversified funding strategy—encompassing fees and promotes from co-investment ventures, distributions from unconsolidated entities, proceeds from dispositions and contributions of real estate investments, borrowing capacity under credit facilities and debt issuance—reinforces financial resilience and supports the financing of development starts, capital expenditures and debt service. As stated in the liquidity and capital resources section, “we consider our ability to generate cash from operating activities, distributions from our co‐investment ventures, dispositions of properties and from available financing sources to be adequate to meet our anticipated future development, acquisition, operating, debt service, dividend and distribution requirements,” highlighting the organization’s readiness to withstand nominal and extreme conditions in volatile markets.

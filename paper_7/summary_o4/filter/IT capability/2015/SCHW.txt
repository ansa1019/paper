Schwab has implemented an enterprise risk management framework, approved by the board of directors, that integrates the firm’s purpose, vision and values to establish risk appetite and a risk‐aware culture, with senior management and a global risk committee—supported by functional sub-committees for asset-liability management, credit and market risk oversight, operational risk, compliance, information security, model governance and vendor management—responsible for systematically identifying, measuring, monitoring and mitigating risks. To minimize business interruptions and preserve operational continuity under internal or external disruptions, the company maintains two data centers, backup and recovery functions, periodic disaster recovery testing and ongoing enhancements to its technology systems, supported by internal controls and contractual standards for third-party service providers. A comprehensive liquidity policy, including regular stress testing, early warning indicators, committed credit facilities and high-quality liquid asset buffers, enables the firm to absorb sudden cash flow variations, while capital management processes—comprising internal capital stress tests, a capital contingency plan and adherence to regulatory capital requirements—ensure that Schwab remains well capitalized and a going concern under extreme financial or operational stress. The bank is also evaluating proposed OCC recovery planning guidelines, which would require detailed plans for maintaining operations during significant stress events, and compliance, legal and model risk procedures, cybersecurity measures and structured collateral arrangements further reinforce the company’s ability to preserve integrity, maintain performance and adapt effectively to evolving pressures.

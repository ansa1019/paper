In its 2015 Management’s Discussion and Analysis, the Company outlines strategic initiatives—active portfolio management, disciplined capital allocation, product and service innovation, and operational effectiveness measures, including data center and real estate consolidation—that enhance operating leverage, improve cost structures (as evidenced by a decline in processing and services cost to 49.4% of revenue in 2015 from 51.3% in 2014) and sustain non-discretionary, recurring revenue streams under evolving regulatory and market pressures. The acquisition of Open Solutions advanced go-to-market strategies by expanding its account processing client base and adding new products, while integration of digital channels and economies of scale demonstrate resource reconfiguration to meet customer needs and competitive challenges. Liquidity and capital resources are managed through robust operating cash flow generation (up 3% to $1.35 billion in 2015), a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility extended to April 2020, term loans and senior notes with covenants limiting indebtedness and safeguarding credit ratings, ensuring the Company can meet debt service requirements, fund capital expenditures and execute strategic transactions even under adverse conditions. Revenue diversification across payments and financial segments, a client base in which the top 50 institutions represent less than 25% of annual revenue, and recurring fee models mitigate the impact of industry consolidation and debt extinguishment actions, reflecting the Company’s adaptive capacity to absorb strain, preserve integrity and maintain performance under both nominal and extreme external disturbances.

Intuitive Surgical continually adapts its resource deployment and strategic initiatives to sustain performance under changing conditions by focusing its organization and investments on developing, marketing, and training for those products and procedures where da Vinci can bring greater patient value relative to alternative treatment options and/or economic benefit to health care providers, matching its system offerings to surgical profiles and patient care requirements. The Company maintains operational continuity and financial resilience through multi-year service contracts entered into at the time systems are sold and generally renewed at stated annual rates, generating recurring revenue that has grown faster than system revenue as the installed base expanded from 2,966 systems at December 31, 2013 to 3,597 at December 31, 2015. Since 2013, it has implemented sales-type and operating lease arrangements to offer customers flexibility in how they acquire da Vinci systems––an adaptive strategy designed to expand surgery availability while leveraging its balance sheet. In response to regulatory obligations and field actions, Intuitive Surgical stopped shipping the EndoWrist™ stapler 45, advised customers to suspend use, refined relevant design elements and manufacturing processes, and began shipping replacement instruments in early 2015, demonstrating rapid risk mitigation, system reconfiguration, and dynamic capabilities to preserve functioning “under internal or external variations and disturbances.” Confronted by FDA morcellation guidance, evolving reimbursement pressures in Japan and Asia, strengthening of the U.S. dollar, and negative media and product liability lawsuits, the Company engaged in tolling agreements and mediation to manage legal risks, safeguard reputation, and ensure business continuity. The April 2014 launch of the da Vinci Xi surgical system, with overhead instrument arms, digital endoscope architecture, universal arm attachments, and subsequent phased introductions of Firefly fluorescence imaging, vessel sealer, stapler instruments, and Integrated Table Motion, exemplifies organizational transformation, operational flexibility, and strategic adaptation to multi-quadrant procedures. Supported by cash generation of $772 million from operations in 2015 and cash, cash equivalents and investments of $3.3 billion at December 31, 2015, Intuitive Surgical preserves system integrity and performance—“absorbing strain and preserving or improving functioning despite the presence of adversity”—while investing substantially in advanced imaging, advanced instrumentation, and next-generation robotics to maintain competitive advantage and future orientation.

The Company’s discussion emphasizes that its operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis, with minimal headquarters involvement in day‐to‐day activities while senior management retains responsibility for significant capital allocation decisions and for establishing and monitoring corporate governance practices to ensure continuity and “tone at the top” under varying conditions. In the insurance operations, extraordinary capital strength—statutory surplus of $124 billion at year‐end—combined with disciplined underwriting (rejecting inadequately priced risks), clearly defined catastrophe loss thresholds and ongoing evaluation of loss estimates and foreign‐currency exposures illustrate efforts to absorb internal and external variations and preserve performance despite volatility and unexpected events. The railroad segment attributes improved system velocity and on‐time performance to capital investments in line expansions, system improvements and additional equipment, demonstrating operational flexibility in response to service‐related challenges, weather disruptions and commodity price fluctuations, while recognizing that fuel surcharge variability and declining volumes in certain categories may adversely affect future revenues and earnings. Utilities and energy businesses adapt to regulatory and market perturbations through rate structures approved by regulators, diversified energy portfolios and strategic acquisitions (Altalink, NV Energy) to maintain integrity and performance under changing cost and demand conditions. Across its manufacturing, service and retailing operations, the Company describes bolt‐on acquisitions, restructuring initiatives, cost‐structure actions and targeted investments—such as new retail stores and aviation training facilities—to confront slowing customer demand, commodity cost deflation and competitive pressures, thus reconfiguring resources and capabilities to sustain functioning. Finance and financial products activities similarly respond to market and credit risks through careful loan loss provisions, interest‐rate management and fleet expansion or disposition strategies. Taken together, these disclosures reflect practices and resource‐allocation decisions intended to absorb strain, mitigate risks, reconfigure trajectories in immediate response to disruptive events and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity.

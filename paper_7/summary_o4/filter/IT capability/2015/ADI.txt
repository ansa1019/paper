Throughout fiscal 2015, we monitored global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis and continued to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness, efficiency and alignment of expenses with revenues, which led to various restructuring actions expected to generate approximately $46.2 million in annual cost savings when fully implemented and to reinvest these savings in product development to drive future growth; we also converted our Irish defined benefit pension plan to a defined contribution plan, recording $223.7 million of settlement charges to settle all existing and future pension liabilities and reduce future funding volatility. Our acquisition of Hittite Microwave Corporation was financed through existing cash and a 90-day term loan and resulted in increased revenues, improved manufacturing utilization levels and a favorable mix shift toward higher-margin products, while recognizing $1.4 billion of goodwill and $666.4 million of intangible assets amortized on a straight-line basis. We maintain diversified cash and short-term investments with high-credit-quality counterparties, continuously monitor credit exposure and leverage our liquidity—including cash generated from operations and available long-term financing—to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development, dividends and share repurchases for at least the next twelve months, thereby preserving operational continuity under varying market demands. Our inventory strategy manages levels to support forecasted sales demand and absorb variations between forecasts and actual demand, which resulted in increased days cost of sales in inventory, while sales to distributors are structured with price-adjustment credits and return rights and defer revenue recognition until end-customer sale to mitigate market uncertainties and preserve margins. Finally, we continue to commit significant resources to research and development, with hundreds of projects underway and ongoing investments in innovative technologies and processes designed to maintain product leadership, enable innovative offerings and support adaptability to future disruptions.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we announced a strategic realignment plan designed to improve execution, enhance financial performance and drive profitable growth as we work to create sustainable long-term value for stockholders, recording restructuring and restructuring-related charges of $190 million during fiscal 2015 and expecting total charges of $350 million to $450 million to right-size our cost structure by approximately $1.1 billion and reduce share-based compensation grants by $300 million by the end of fiscal 2016; to support this plan and our capital return program, in March 2015 our board authorized up to $15 billion of share repurchases and a commitment to return at least 75% of free cash flow to stockholders, we completed $8.1 billion of accelerated share repurchases and have repurchased and retired 24.6 million shares for $1.4 billion since September 27, 2015, and in May 2015 we issued $10.0 billion of unsecured floating- and fixed-rate notes, with net proceeds of $9.9 billion used to fund repurchases and other general corporate purposes; we continue to invest significant resources in the development of 3G, 3G/4G multimode and 4G LTE technologies, OFDM-based WLAN, audio and video codecs, baseband and Snapdragon chips, graphics, connectivity, multimedia products, software and services, and in targeted opportunities leveraging our existing technical expertise to deploy new business models in connected home, Internet of Things, automotive, networking, mobile computing, small cells, data centers, mobile health, wireless charging and machine learning, including robotics, with $5.5 billion of research and development expenditures in fiscal 2015 and 2014 and purchase obligations of $3.0 billion for fiscal 2016 and $953 million for fiscal 2017; we utilize a fabless production model relying on independent third-party suppliers under both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing models for silicon die and integrated circuit assembly and test, managing cancellation and capacity-underutilization risks; in response to a $975 million fine and rectification plan imposed by China’s NDRC, we believe certain licensees remain non-compliant with reporting obligations and execution of new agreements is delayed, yet progress is being made with new terms and negotiations continue, although litigation may be necessary to compel compliance; we anticipate continued growth in global demand for 3G and 3G/4G multimode products, increased penetration of low-tier smartphones in emerging markets, and ongoing variability in device pricing due to competition and regional economic conditions; our principal sources of liquidity include $30.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $5.5 billion of operating cash flow, a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring February 2020, a $4.0 billion commercial paper program and employee equity plan proceeds, which we believe will satisfy working and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months; we record impairment charges on investments deemed other-than-temporary after considering decline significance, duration, market volatility, investee performance and industry outlook, test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles annually or upon triggering events and review long-lived amortizable assets for recoverability based on operating performance and market conditions; we are engaged in legal proceedings, record loss contingencies when probable and estimable, and manage our income tax position by indefinitely reinvesting $28.8 billion of foreign earnings outside the United States based on plans and liquidity needs, recognizing that a change in reinvestment plans would require adjustment of our tax provision; and we use non-GAAP measures such as free cash flow—defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures—to assess cash generation available for growth and stockholder value and to report return of capital as a percentage of free cash flow.

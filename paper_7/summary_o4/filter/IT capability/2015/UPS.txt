In response to uneven U.S. and global economic growth, volatile commodity prices and slowing demand in key sectors, management continued to adjust its air capacity and cost structure across its transportation network to better match prevailing volume levels and leverage the flexibilities inherent in its broad portfolio of product offerings to adapt to these changing trends. While the worldwide economic environment remained challenging in 2015, the company undertook initiatives to improve the flexibility and capacity of its network, refine yield management, increase operational efficiency and contain costs across all segments. Most notably, the accelerated deployment of technology improvements—including facility automation projects and the on-road integrated optimization and navigation system (“Orion”)—was designed to increase network capacity, operational efficiency, flexibility and reliability, and newly expanded operating facilities were utilized to improve time-in-transit in each region. Network efficiency and productivity enhancements, such as ongoing modifications to air and ground configurations and restrained growth in aircraft block hours, enabled the company to contain average daily vehicle miles driven even as package volume increased, resulting in a 0.4 percent reduction in adjusted cost per piece. International package operations mitigated the impact of currency translation and lower fuel surcharge revenues through disciplined capacity management, network adjustments and service enhancements, leading to reduced network and pickup-and-delivery costs despite higher export volumes. Within Supply Chain & Freight, the forwarding and logistics unit improved profitability by negotiating lower third-party air capacity rates and benefiting from ocean freight cost reductions, while freight operations achieved a 1.9 percent decline in total adjusted cost per less-than-truckload shipment through lower fuel expense, optimized carrier contracts and linehaul network adjustments, demonstrating the firm’s ability to reconfigure resources and preserve performance under external pressures.

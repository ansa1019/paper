Management’s discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that reflect plans, estimates, and beliefs regarding the maintenance of performance under changing conditions and the mitigation of risks, including foreign currency fluctuations, through non-GAAP constant currency measures that provide greater transparency into underlying trends. In 2015, the company continued progress on its revenue growth priorities—capitalizing on mobile, expanding marketer adoption, and enhancing ad relevance—and invested across three strategic areas: core products and services to serve existing communities, next-generation offerings such as Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, and long-term innovation efforts in connectivity, virtual reality and artificial intelligence research; these investments are expected to drive significant year-over-year expense growth and preserve or improve functioning despite evolving market constraints. The firm anticipates mobile user growth will continue to be the principal driver of engagement metrics, and it plans substantial capital expenditures in 2016 to expand data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support increased user engagement and delivery of new services. Headcount growth in engineering, marketing, sales and general and administrative functions will further support research and development, marketing efforts and overall corporate expansion. With $18.43 billion of cash and marketable securities, a $6.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, and robust cash generation from operations adjusted for noncash items such as share-based compensation and depreciation, the company currently anticipates that its available funds, liquidity facility and operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet its operational cash needs for the foreseeable future. Critical accounting policies and estimates are continuously evaluated and adjusted, including the quarterly review of loss contingencies—where liabilities are recorded when both probable and reasonably estimable—and the periodic impairment assessment of intangible assets and goodwill, reflecting a systematic approach to risk assessment, resource reconfiguration and resilience strategy implementation that sustains integrity and performance under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

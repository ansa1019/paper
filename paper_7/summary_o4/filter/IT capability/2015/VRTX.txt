While maintaining our financial strength, we closely monitor the results of our discovery, research, clinical trials and nonclinical studies and frequently evaluate our drug development programs in light of new data and scientific, business and commercial insights with the objective of balancing risk and potential, a process that “can result in abrupt changes in focus and priorities” as new information becomes available and as we gain additional understanding of our programs, those of our competitors and the commercial environment. We believe that pursuing research in diverse areas allows us to balance the risks inherent in drug development and may provide drug candidates that will form our pipeline in future years, and all research and development costs for our drugs and drug candidates are expensed as incurred. We dedicate substantial management and other resources to obtain and maintain appropriate levels of reimbursement for our products from third-party payors through engagements with government and commercial insurers and country-by-country approval processes, acknowledging that external pressures can significantly affect product accessibility and financial performance. We expect cash flows from ORKAMBI and KALYDECO to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months, intend to rely on existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with product sales as our primary source of liquidity, have borrowed under a senior secured term loan and, subject to certain conditions, may request additional borrowings, all while considering public offerings, strategic collaborations and other financing opportunities to strengthen our long-term liquidity profile. We review our estimates of contractual commitments, lease obligations and research, development and drug supply accruals on at least a quarterly basis, making whatever modifications we believe necessary to reflect changed circumstances, and estimate such obligations by utilizing probability-weighted discounted cash flows and a credit-adjusted risk-free rate to reflect the time-value of money. We test our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and more frequently if indicators are present — including receipt of additional clinical data, changes in development timelines or new information regarding potential sales — writing down carrying values to fair value when impairment exists. Our collaboration agreements include up-front license fees, funding of research and development activities, milestone and royalty payments contingent upon achievement of predefined targets, and we allocate consideration to deliverables using relative selling price based on assumptions about development timelines, cost estimates and discount rates. We recognize that significant regulatory delays, limitations or denials of approval, as well as extended reimbursement discussions or negative covenant restrictions, could harm our financial results and commercial prospects, and we maintain a corporate compliance program designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through comprehensive policies and systems, thereby preserving organizational integrity and performance under challenging conditions.

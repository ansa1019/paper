The Company’s management discussion and analysis describes a suite of strategic actions and resources that collectively support its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under internal and external disturbances: it continuously pursues additional financing, debt restructuring, and the evaluation of secured and unsecured debt and equity transactions to ensure sufficient liquidity for at least the next twelve months; it invests heavily in manufacturing technologies, facility expansions—including a 255,000-square-foot clean room addition in Singapore to enable flexible, incremental capacity in response to market requirements—and research and development of next-generation memory and system-level products to maintain product quality and operational continuity under fluctuating market and cost pressures; it optimizes its cost structure through periodic restructuring activities, asset impairment reviews, wind-down of non-core operations, and workforce adjustments to improve efficiency and focus on core memory operations; it has renegotiated supply agreements with Inotera and IMFT, implementing formula-based pricing and wind-down mechanisms to balance capacity, cost, and margin sharing, thereby mitigating the risk of supply volatility; it manages cash held by foreign subsidiaries, including MMJ’s constrained assets and tax-incentivized jurisdictions, to support reinvestment and preserve system integrity; it employs off-balance-sheet capped calls to limit the dilutive impact of convertible notes; and it maintains rigorous, judgment-based processes for critical accounting estimates—covering acquisitions, inventory realizability, income taxes, contingencies, and impairment testing—to ensure accurate impact assessment, risk mitigation, and adaptive decision-making under adverse or unexpected conditions.

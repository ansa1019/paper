Our corporate structure has facilitated the development of management talent by giving each profit center’s senior management team the necessary autonomy within underwriting authorities to make operating decisions and create products and coverages needed by its target customer base, while our diversified operating model—comprising profit centers by line of business and territory that can access various legal entities subject to licensing and other regulatory rules—is expected to generate underwriting income and appropriate risk-adjusted returns.  To ensure business continuity and the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, we believe that our cash balance, our highly liquid investments, credit facilities, and reinsurance protection provide sufficient liquidity to meet unforeseen claim demands, and to further strengthen our resilience we hold certain invested assets in cash and short-term investments, maintain a $1.5 billion operational letter of credit facility, and employ two international multi-currency notional cash pooling programs to address short-term timing mismatches across currencies.  We actively monitor our catastrophe risk accumulation using third-party modeling packages to simulate potential hurricane and earthquake losses, regularly review and layer our global property catastrophe reinsurance program in excess of our retained losses, and purchase political risk, trade credit, and structured trade credit policies with basic loss-sharing features, waiting periods to enable agreement on recovery strategies, and subrogation rights, thereby mitigating underwriting and timing risks.  Our strategy for managing the financial market and policyholder behavior risks embedded in variable annuity guarantees includes structuring reinsurance contracts with annual and aggregate claim limits, setting aggregate exposure limits, and executing a hedging strategy designed both to reduce long-term economic loss and dampen income statement volatility.  We maintain long-standing global credit limits on our investment portfolio, aggregate exposures and enforce strict diversification and counterparty limits through our global credit committee to preserve system integrity and performance under internal and external disturbances.  In connection with acquisitions, we execute detailed integration road maps globally, track progress against expense and growth-related initiatives, establish expense synergy targets (currently a $650 million annual run rate by the end of 2018), and estimate integration and branding expenses, thereby preserving organizational flexibility, resource allocation efficiency, and adaptability in the face of disruptive change.

Starbucks’ fiscal 2015 results demonstrate the continued strength of our global business model and our ability to successfully make disciplined investments in our business and our partners (employees), leveraging sales and operating leverage, supply-chain improvements and digital platforms to drive revenue growth, margin expansion and operational flexibility. We actively manage our cash and investments—including a diversified available-for-sale securities portfolio, revolving credit and commercial paper facilities—to internally fund operating needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends, thereby preserving liquidity and business continuity. Our market price risk management policy employs hedging instruments to mitigate commodity price and foreign currency volatility and forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge benchmark interest rate fluctuations on anticipated debt issuances, while we continuously evaluate liquidity, funding needs and contractual obligations to maintain compliance with covenants. Strategic initiatives such as the portfolio shift to higher-margin licensed stores, disciplined new store openings across segments and the full consolidation of Starbucks Japan enhance integration and resource reconfiguration, support adaptation to external pressures and currency fluctuations, and reinforce our capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under adverse conditions, thereby embodying our organizational resilience as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

We manage our business in four segments, with net revenues and operating income affected by factors such as product volume and mix, pricing, currency exchange rate fluctuations and geographic mix, reflecting organizational performance under varying external pressures; we often collect excise taxes from customers and remit them to governments, and as a holding company our principal sources of funds to service debt obligations are dividends and debt repayments from subsidiaries, which are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or make distributions, demonstrating resource flexibility and continuity of operations. In the fourth quarter of 2015, to align with the European Union member state composition, we transferred management of operations in certain countries between segments, resulting in the reclassification of prior-year amounts without impacting our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, evidence of adaptive organizational change processes. During 2015 we recorded pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs of $68 million related to severance costs for organizational restructuring in our European Union segment, and in 2014 we recorded pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs of $535 million related to factory closures in the Netherlands, Australia and Canada and the restructuring of the U.S. leaf purchasing model, including consultations with employee representatives, social plan agreements and cessation of production, illustrating reconfiguration and reconstitution of operations in response to disruptive events. Our effective income tax rate for 2015 decreased to 28.0%, driven in part by a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits following IRS examinations, reflecting risk assessment and mitigation strategies. We forecast full-year 2016 reported diluted EPS of $4.25 to $4.35, excluding unfavorable currency impacts of approximately $0.60 per share, with volume estimates declining by 2.0%-2.5%, and we will revisit share repurchase potential as the year unfolds depending on currency conditions, demonstrating forward planning under uncertainty. We define adjusted diluted EPS—reported diluted EPS adjusted for asset impairment and exit costs, discrete tax items and unusual items—as representing core earnings, improving comparability and aiding in the analysis of business performance trends, and we exclude the impact of future acquisitions, unanticipated impairment and exit cost charges, currency changes and unusual events from our 2016 guidance, noting that the factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors represent continuing risks to this forecast, thereby maintaining a systemic perspective on resilience in the face of environmental turbulence and operational variability.

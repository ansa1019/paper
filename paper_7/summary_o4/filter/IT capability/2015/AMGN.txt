In 2015, Amgen advanced a company-wide transformation and process improvement program to refine its operating model, reallocate resources toward its innovative pipeline and growth opportunities, improve manufacturing efficiencies and reconstitute its geographic footprint; these restructuring initiatives, which encompassed facility exits, staff reductions and process optimization, supported operational flexibility, cost-structure resilience and enabled reinvestment in strategic areas of focus. The Company continues to face environmental perturbations such as pricing pressures, competitive incursions—including loss of patent protection and biosimilar competition—and regulatory scrutiny; it addresses these adversities by maintaining diversified liquidity sources—operating cash flows, marketable securities, commercial paper, a revolving credit facility and targeted debt issuances—and by employing hedging strategies through interest rate and cross-currency swaps to mitigate foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Amgen sustains performance under pressure by allocating considerable resources to discovery research, translational sciences, later-stage clinical programs and marketed-product support, leveraging internal knowledge, advanced human genetics and biologics manufacturing expertise to drive service innovation, product launches and customer- and provider-friendly delivery systems. Its future-oriented resilience strategies further include inter-organizational collaborations, strategic business development, disciplined capital returns and global market expansion, collectively ensuring the maintenance of system integrity and partial preservation of performance while pursuing long-term growth and survival objectives.

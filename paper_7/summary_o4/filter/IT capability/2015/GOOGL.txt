The report describes how the company maintains positive adjustment under challenging conditions by continually expanding and reconfiguring its product and service offerings in response to evolving user behaviors, the shift to a dynamic multi‐device environment and emerging market developments; by investing heavily in research and development, capital expenditures, acquisitions and human capital to build dynamic capabilities and drive service innovation; by implementing legal and operational changes under the Alphabet reorganization to enhance resource allocation and performance assessment; by preserving business continuity and operational flexibility through diversified funding sources—including cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, revolving credit facilities, commercial paper and share repurchase programs—and through a foreign exchange risk management program that mitigates exposure to currency fluctuations; and by periodically reviewing and adapting its impairment assessments, contingent liability reserves and tax provisions, all of which collectively support its ability to absorb strain, reconfigure resources and preserve or improve functioning despite internal and external pressures.

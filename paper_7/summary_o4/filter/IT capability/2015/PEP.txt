PepsiCo has established an integrated risk management framework—overseen by its board of directors, dedicated board committees, a cross‐functional global risk committee, division and country risk committees, a risk management office, internal audit and a compliance and ethics department—to systematically identify, assess, prioritize, manage and monitor strategic, financial, operational, compliance, safety, reputational and other risks, thereby fostering business continuity and the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The company addresses volatile macroeconomic and geopolitical instability, resource scarcity, currency restrictions and intensifying regulatory pressures by balancing its portfolio across categories and geographies, refranchising noncore operations and remeasuring and impairing investments when necessary, as exemplified by its adaptive deconsolidation and cost‐method accounting for Venezuelan subsidiaries. Through productivity and efficiency initiatives—including manufacturing automation, shared services, go-to-market reengineering, “smart spending” policies, global purchasing programs and hedging strategies for commodities, foreign exchange and interest rates—PepsiCo absorbs strain, preserves or improves functioning, and mitigates disruptions. Complementing these measures, the company sustains long-term performance and competitive advantage by disciplined capital allocation, robust cash-flow generation, investment in brand building, research and development, digital marketing and e-commerce capabilities, and targeted talent management and leadership development, all of which contribute to its ability to adapt, reconfigure resources and emerge stronger from adversity.

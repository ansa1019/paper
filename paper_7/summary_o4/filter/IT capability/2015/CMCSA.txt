Comcast anticipates that its programming expenses will continue to increase, which may negatively impact operating margin, and will attempt to mitigate increases in operating costs and expenses by growing revenue, particularly in its high-speed internet, video and business services. The cable communications segment continues to invest in internal resources and service innovation through the accelerated deployment of its IP and cloud-enabled X1 video platform and cloud DVR technology, the deployment of wireless gateways throughout its footprint to improve the performance of multiple internet-enabled devices and create in-home Wi-Fi networks, and improvements to network infrastructure to increase capacity; it is also expanding its network of residential, outdoor and business Wi-Fi hotspots to provide access inside and outside the home and investing in customer premise equipment, business services expansion and customer experience tools. These targeted capital expenditures and technology deployments reinforce operational flexibility and system integrity under varying demand and environmental disruptions. Comcast maintains significant liquidity to ensure business continuity, including $6.25 billion and $1.35 billion revolving credit facilities supporting commercial paper programs, routinely tests for compliance with leverage covenants and plans to fund ongoing capital requirements, debt obligations and strategic initiatives through operating cash flows, existing cash and access to external financing. The investment commitment of up to $4 billion in Atairos and continued development of the Beijing theme park project reflect future-oriented resource reconfiguration, while the NBCUniversal segments’ continued investment in new attractions such as the Wizarding World of Harry Potter – Diagon Alley and Fast & Furious – Supercharged, along with consolidated term loans with covenant compliance, illustrate the company’s capacity to absorb strain, adapt to competitive and economic turbulence, and preserve or improve functioning under adversity, consistent with a systemic perspective on organizational resilience.

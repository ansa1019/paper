We manage research and development spending across our portfolio of molecules so that a delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending, thereby mitigating the risk of individual program failure and preserving organizational performance under uncertainty. We regularly review wholesaler inventory levels and adjust reserve estimates for sales returns, rebates, and discounts to maintain operational continuity in the product supply chain and preserve gross margin integrity. To address fluctuations in interest rates and currency values, we maintain a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments, forward and option contracts, and a balanced mix of fixed‐ and floating‐rate debt positions, which limits the impact of environmental perturbations on earnings and cash flows. We believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets and unused committed credit facilities should be adequate to fund short‐term borrowing needs and support business continuity. We conduct ongoing cost‐containment efforts, recognize restructuring charges related to severance and integration costs for acquisitions, and test intangible and long‐lived assets for impairment to ensure appropriate resource allocation and preserve system integrity. We engage in strategic collaborations and licensing agreements, evaluate contingent milestone and royalty obligations, and manage tax positions and legal contingencies, enabling inter‐organizational collaboration and dynamic resource reconfiguration. These measures—which embody the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions and the ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite internal or external variations and disturbances—support our resilience and capacity to emerge stronger from adverse events.

AMD faced a challenging business environment in 2015, noting that the impact of global macro-economic conditions, especially the volatility in the Greater China region, and increased competitive pressures contributed to a decrease in demand for products. In response, the company advanced its long-term strategy by diversifying its product portfolio and introducing new processors and graphics solutions, including 6th generation A-series mobile processors and Radeon R9 series graphics, to enhance resilience through innovation. To preserve performance and better align resources with strategic priorities, AMD implemented a restructuring plan in the third quarter of 2015—following a similar plan in 2014—that reduced global headcount by approximately 5% and 6%, respectively, outsourced certain IT services and application development, and consolidated real estate facilities, resulting in operational savings and an expected $48 million benefit in 2016. The company also executed inventory write-downs of $65 million and a $33 million technology node transition charge, reflecting proactive risk mitigation and resource reconfiguration. To secure business continuity and liquidity, AMD maintained cash and marketable securities of $785 million as of year-end, optimized its debt profile through selective repurchases and issuances of senior notes, and secured access to a $500 million revolving line of credit. Further bolstering its supply chain and inter-organizational collaboration, AMD entered into an equity interest purchase agreement on October 15, 2015 to form joint ventures in China and Malaysia that will provide assembly, testing, marking, packing and packaging services, thereby reinforcing operational flexibility and resilience against external disruptions.

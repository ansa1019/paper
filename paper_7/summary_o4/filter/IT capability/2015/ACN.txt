Revenues are driven by our ability to secure new contracts and rapidly deploy global teams of skilled professionals, and our results of operations are continuously affected by macroeconomic volatility, geopolitical uncertainty and foreign currency exchange fluctuations, which we monitor proactively while managing costs through targeted cost-management actions across cost of services, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. We plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce to address current and projected demand, adjusting hiring, attrition and compensation levels and the mix of on-shore, off-shore and subcontractor resources to balance skill supply with client needs and to protect gross margin. We mitigate foreign exchange risk through currency protection provisions in customer contracts and hedging programs, recognize and continuously reassess contract profitability under complex time-and-materials, fixed-price and incentive structures, and record loss provisions when contract costs are expected to exceed revenues. Deferred transition costs for outsourcing arrangements are amortized over service periods and monitored for impairment, while unbilled and deferred revenues are tracked to ensure performance aligns with billing under evolving client engagements. Our robust liquidity and capital resources—including substantial cash reserves, strong operating cash flows, committed credit facilities, and the flexibility to raise additional debt or equity—are maintained to fund working capital needs, strategic initiatives, dividend payments and share repurchases, thereby preserving operational continuity and the integrity of our performance under internal and external perturbations and supporting the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

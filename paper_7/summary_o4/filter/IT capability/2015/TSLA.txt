We have enhanced our operational flexibility and preserved functioning under rapid growth by expanding production capacity through a new final assembly line, paint and body shops, and additional stamping capacity, transitioning energy storage production to the gigafactory and ramping Model X output, thereby absorbing strain and maintaining performance under challenging conditions. We continue to increase our global sales and service infrastructure—including our supercharger and destination charging networks—and plan approximately $1.5 billion in capital expenditures in 2016 to fund tooling, cell production equipment, Model 3 machinery installation and the opening of retail, service and supercharger locations, supporting our future orientation and competitive advantage. To secure our liquidity and resource needs, we held $1.20 billion in cash and equivalents, secured a $1 billion asset-based revolving credit facility, and collect refundable customer deposits, while deferring revenues and costs under vehicle lease and resale value guarantee programs that require ongoing risk assessment of market values and warranty provisions to mitigate potential cash‐flow volatility. We target improved automotive gross margins through material cost reductions, manufacturing efficiencies and process improvement initiatives to support profitability in late 2016, but acknowledge that delays in ramping new models, limited international experience and evolving economic or regulatory conditions could impede delivery plans and adversely affect our financial condition. Strategic partnerships—such as the Panasonic arrangement for full-output battery cell production—and our continual evaluation of critical accounting estimates, tax provisions and contract obligations reflect a systemic perspective, dynamic capabilities and proactive resource reconfiguration to adapt to internal and external disturbances and maintain integrity, continuity and growth.

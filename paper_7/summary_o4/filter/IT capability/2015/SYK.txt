In its management’s discussion and analysis, the Company emphasizes a global distribution network operating in approximately 100 countries through company-owned sales subsidiaries, branches and third-party dealers and separate dedicated sales forces for each principal product line to provide operational flexibility and specialized expertise. The Company’s operating cash flow serves as the primary source of funds for operating needs, capital expenditures and strategic acquisitions that complement its portfolio, with excess cash directed to dividends and share repurchases, and supplemented as necessary by debt financings supported by $1,236 million of available credit capacity and strong short- and long-term debt ratings to ensure liquidity and business continuity under varying market and economic conditions. Capital expenditures are principally allocated to acquisition integration support, information technology infrastructure upgrades, capacity expansion, new product introductions, innovation and cost savings initiatives, while research, development and engineering expenses reflect investments in new technologies and project timing. To mitigate financial risks, the Company employs forward currency exchange contracts and net investment hedges to manage foreign currency exposure, maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and for accounts receivable—particularly in the southern European region—to address demand variability and credit risk, and self-insures product liability exposures with accruals based on actuarially determined estimates of recall-related settlement obligations. The Company records acquisition and integration-related costs, restructuring-related charges and regulatory and legal liabilities based on consultation with legal counsel and historical settlement experience, and conducts annual impairment testing of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets using discounted cash flow analyses to identify and measure potential impairments when events or circumstances indicate carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These practices reflect a systematic approach to resource allocation, risk assessment and financial management designed to preserve organizational integrity and maintain performance in the face of internal and external variations and disturbances.

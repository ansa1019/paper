Managementâ€™s discussion and analysis emphasizes forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially. We have pioneered the next-generation of security with our innovative platform that empowers enterprises, service providers, and government entities to secure their organizations by safely enabling the increasingly complex and rapidly growing number of applications running on their networks and by preventing breaches in real time that stem from targeted cyber attacks. Our subscription services can be easily activated on any of our appliances without requiring additional hardware or processing resources, thereby providing a seamless implementation path for our end-customers. We believe our hybrid SaaS revenue model of product, subscriptions, and support and maintenance will enable us to benefit from recurring revenues as we continue to grow our installed end-customer base. We believe that the growth of our business and our short-term and long-term success are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to extend our technology leadership, grow our base of end-customers, expand deployment of our platform and services within existing end-customers, extend the length of service terms within existing end-customers, and focus on end-customer satisfaction. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. We face intense competition in our market, and to succeed, we need to innovate and offer products that are differentiated from existing infrastructure products, as well as effectively hire, retain, train, and motivate qualified personnel and senior management. We monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods, and we consider free cash flow and billings to be useful liquidity measures that provide information about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet, and as an important indicator of the health and visibility of our business. At July 31, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents and investments of $1.3 billion were held for working capital purposes and we believe that our cash flow from operations with existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future, although our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings, the costs to acquire or invest in complementary businesses and technologies, the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity, and the continuing market acceptance of our products, and we may also choose to seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on acceptable terms. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015 was $350.3 million, an increase due to growth of our business and changes in our assets and liabilities, and we outsource most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturer, which procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts, and we accrue for costs for manufacturing commitments in excess of our forecasted demand, recognizing that actual component usage and product demand may be materially different and could adversely impact our results of operations. We accrue for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated and provide disclosures when a range of possible loss exists. Critical accounting policies requiring significant judgment and ongoing evaluation include revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements, share-based compensation based on fair value estimates, income tax valuations and deferred tax asset allowances, contract manufacturer liabilities, loss contingencies, and goodwill and intangible asset impairment evaluations.

In 2015, we introduced our un-carrier proposition with the objective of eliminating customer pain points from the unnecessary complexity of the wireless communication industry, focusing resources on network improvements and customer experience, as evidenced by strong customer growth momentum and a reduction in branded postpaid churn from 1.58% to 1.39%. To further strengthen our operational flexibility and organizational resilience, we substantially completed the upgrade of our network to the fastest nationwide 4G LTE, commenced build-out of our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum license network, and realized cost control synergies and risk mitigation through the decommissioning of redundant MetroPCS CDMA network assets, recognizing network decommissioning costs to accelerate lease expenses and repurpose resources. We have continued to develop adaptive device financing and lease programs, including Jump! On Demand and EIP arrangements, deferring lease revenues and depreciating leased devices over their useful lives to balance cash flows against evolving customer upgrade behavior, and established revolving receivables sales structures and master lease agreements to extend payment terms and diversify liquidity sources. We supplemented cash flow by generating $5.4 billion from operations, maintaining a $500 million unsecured credit facility, incurring $26.3 billion of debt with capacity to raise an additional $6.0 billion for spectrum acquisition, and forecasting $4.5â€“$4.8 billion in network capital expenditures for 2016. Management regularly reviews projected financial and operating performance, market conditions and competitive dynamics to inform strategic spectrum license acquisitions, capital deployment and operating priorities, ensuring our ability to absorb strain, preserve and enhance performance under internal and external variations and maintain system integrity and continuity of service.

The report emphasizes our capacity to maintain continuity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions by actively managing liquidity, capital deployment and operational structure across diverse market environments.  As a global investment firm, we acknowledge that global and regional economic conditions, including equity market volatility, dislocations in credit markets and currency fluctuations, impose pressures that we mitigate through financing flexibility, hedging strategies and opportunistic investments at reduced valuations to position the firm for future growth.  We deploy resources from both our funds and balance sheet in a disciplined, long‐term horizon that accommodates fluctuations in transaction activity and market valuations, and we expand into complementary strategies—energy real assets, infrastructure, real estate, alternative credit and hedge funds—to reconfigure our platform and preserve or enhance performance despite external disturbances.  Consolidation of funds in which we hold controlling interests affords operational discretion and systemic governance, while regular reallocation of expenses and corporate overhead among segments reflects organizational agility and adaptive resource management.  Our liquidity framework draws on fees, carried interest realizations, dividends, interest income, asset dispositions and credit facilities, enabling us to fund capital commitments, underwrite transactions, service debt obligations, pursue acquisitions and effect capital distributions under our distribution policy.  The unit repurchase program and tax receivable agreement illustrate forward planning and stakeholder alignment, and our rigorous fair value measurement policies—with hierarchical inputs, independent valuation reviews and oversight committees—ensure system integrity and performance maintenance under varying internal and external constraints.

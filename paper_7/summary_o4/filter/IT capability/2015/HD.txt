Throughout fiscal 2015 and early fiscal 2016, the company undertook a suite of strategic, operational and financial measures designed to absorb strain, preserve functionality and emerge stronger from adversity. In response to the third-quarter 2014 data breach, it completed a major payment security project providing enhanced encryption of payment card data at point of sale in all U.S. and Canadian stores, rolled out EMV chip card technology, recorded accruals for estimated probable losses and entered into settlement agreements with the major card networks, and maintained $100 million of network security and privacy liability insurance above a $10 million deductible to limit exposure to similar events. To bolster business continuity and operational flexibility, the company initiated Project Sync, a multi-year supply chain optimization program reducing lead times and transportation costs and improving inventory turns via an end-to-end solution linking suppliers, transportation providers, regional distribution centers and store associates; expanded its distribution footprint with three new direct fulfillment centers to reach 90 percent of U.S. customers in two business days; fully implemented BOSS via RDC delivery and began rolling out BODFS, resulting in over 40 percent of online orders being picked up in stores; and enhanced customer experience through retraining associates on its customer-first program and deploying web-enabled handheld devices to expedite in-aisle sales. Capital allocation and risk mitigation strategies included disciplined share repurchases of $7.0 billion, a 17 percent dividend increase, the $1.7 billion acquisition of Interline to augment MRO capabilities, diversified financing through commercial paper programs backed by a $2.0 billion credit facility, multiple issuances of fixed and floating-rate senior notes, and forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge anticipated debt issuances. These initiatives, coupled with strong comparable-store sales growth of 5.6 percent, expense leverage that reduced SG&A as a percentage of sales to 19.0 percent, and sustained operating income margin expansion, reflect the companyâ€™s systemic ability to adapt to environmental perturbations, manage resource allocation and sustain performance under pressure.

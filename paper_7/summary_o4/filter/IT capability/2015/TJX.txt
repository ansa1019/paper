During fiscal 2016, the Company maintained operational continuity and preserved performance under varying external and internal pressures by generating strong cash flows to support reinvestment in new stores, remodeling existing locations and strengthening its infrastructure, while returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases; it proactively managed supply-chain and currency-related risks by leveraging inventory-related hedging instruments, mark-to-market adjustments and expense leverage on buying and occupancy costs, and by closely monitoring changes in merchandise inventories, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to mitigate the impact of timing and foreign currency fluctuations; the Company deployed financial and human resources through a multi-phase wage initiative, targeted capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion for offices, distribution centers, store renovations and new stores, and investments in executive savings plan options, demonstrating adaptability and resource reconfiguration in support of growth; it further enhanced resilience by centralizing support functions, acquiring and integrating new operations such as Trade Secret in Australia, diversifying its business segments across geographies, and maintaining ample liquidity through internally generated funds, credit facilities and disciplined working capital management to ensure preparedness for unexpected market disruptions and to preserve system integrity and firm performance under challenging conditions.

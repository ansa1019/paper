The report describes a comprehensive enterprise‐wide risk framework and governance structure designed to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions by establishing clear roles, responsibilities and accountability for risk management; aligning strategies, capital plans and liquidity plans with a defined risk appetite; and continuously evaluating and reinforcing a strong risk culture through training, controls and independent challenge. It details how management identifies, measures, monitors and controls credit, market, liquidity, operational and compliance risks—performing periodic stress tests and contingency planning across business segments and legal entities to anticipate and respond to disruptive events, maintain system integrity, preserve performance and support ongoing operations. The corporation maintains excess liquidity in the form of high‐quality cash and securities, diversifies its funding sources, limits concentration risks by industry and geography, and regularly updates its allowance for credit losses based on portfolio performance, collateral values, economic trends and model forecasts. To mitigate market sensitivities, asset and liability management activities employ derivatives, securities and structured liabilities to hedge interest‐rate, foreign‐exchange and mortgage‐related exposures, while mortgage servicing rights and related hedges are valued and stress‐tested to ensure resilience to prepayment and rate shifts. Regular backtesting, model validation and independent audit reinforce the robustness of risk measurement and recovery mechanisms, and the corporation’s capital and liquidity contingency plans—including resolution planning and recovery planning—are designed to ensure continuity of critical functions even under extreme scenarios, thereby supporting its ability to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning and emerge stronger from adversity.

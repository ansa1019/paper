The company reports that it has been successful historically in adapting its business to changing external conditions through adjustments to pricing and merchandise mix, increased penetration of private-label items and expansion of online offerings, and by applying a consistent operating model across its U.S., Canadian and other international segments to preserve performance under varying market pressures. Its membership format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue, while its compensation philosophy, which maintains wages and benefits above industry averages, is intended to reduce employee turnover and enhance satisfaction, thereby supporting operational continuity. The company states that cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet its liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future, supplemented by bank credit facilities, letter of credit arrangements and a captive insurance subsidiary with reinsurance programs to mitigate risk. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic—which was declared a national emergency on March 11, 2020—the company took measures to protect members and employees, maintained its warehouses as essential businesses resulting in strong sales increases in core merchandise categories, leveraged higher sales to improve gross margin and SG&A efficiencies, and benefited from accelerated e-commerce growth, even as it acknowledged decreases in ancillary businesses and incurred incremental wage and sanitation costs. Its capital expenditure program, focused on new and remodeled warehouses, manufacturing and distribution facilities and information systems, and its disclosure of preopening expenses and COVID-19-related delays in real estate and construction activities, further illustrate its strategic resource deployment and adaptive processes to absorb strain and maintain functioning under adversity.

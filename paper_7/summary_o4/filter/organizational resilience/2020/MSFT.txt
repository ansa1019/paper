As the world responded to the outbreak of a novel strain of the coronavirus, the company ensured the safety of its employees, strove to protect the health and well-being of the communities in which it operates, and provided technology and resources to customers to help them maintain operations while working remotely. Recognizing that its industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models, the company continually evolves and adapts by investing in research and development activities to identify and address changing customer demands, industry trends, and competitive forces, and by increasing infrastructure and device investments to support the scale and efficiency of its cloud offerings, even as these investments increase operating costs. The company employs derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit, and diversifies its investment portfolio among highly liquid, investment-grade securities to preserve capital and liquidity. It reports unearned revenue ratably over multi-year subscription periods to align revenue recognition with service delivery and to sustain predictable performance. To ensure continued access to capital and to optimize its debt profile under favorable market conditions, the company issues and exchanges debt with longer maturities, and uses its cash, cash equivalents, and investments to fund working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, and dividends. The company maintains robust liquidity, anticipated to be sufficient to meet operating activities and financing commitments for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Through ongoing application of judgment in critical accounting policies—such as revenue recognition for integrated cloud and on-premises offerings, impairment reviews of investment securities and goodwill, contingencies for legal and tax uncertainties, and inventory valuation based on demand forecasts and product life cycles—the company preserves its system integrity and performance under internal and external variations, adapts its estimates and asset lives in response to changing circumstances, and thus reinforces its capacity to absorb strain and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

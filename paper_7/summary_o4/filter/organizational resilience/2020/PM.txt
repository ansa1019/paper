we are leading a transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smoke-free future and ultimately replace cigarettes with smoke-free products to the benefit of adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, society, the company and its shareholders; we are building a future on a new category of smoke-free products that, while not risk-free, are a much better choice than continuing to smoke; through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation, we aim to ensure that our smoke-free products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements; we manage our business in six operating segments spanning more than 175 markets with a portfolio comprising both international and local brands, and in addition to the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, we are engaged in the development and commercialization of reduced-risk products (“RRPs”), which present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continuing smoking; net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors, including the volume of products sold, product mix, pricing, currency exchange rates and geographic mix, with costs of sales and marketing, administration and research—including estimated warranty provisions and new product development costs—structured to absorb strain and preserve functioning under varying internal or external pressures; as a holding company, our principal sources of funds are dividends and debt repayments from our subsidiaries, and our principal wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to make cash distributions compliant with law; net revenues of $28.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased by $1.1 billion, or 3.7%, compared to 2019, driven by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, unfavorable volume/mix and deconsolidation impacts, partially offset by favorable pricing variances.

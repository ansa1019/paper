Throughout fiscal 2021, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic the Company focused on maintaining business continuity and supporting employees, customers and communities by implementing a global work-from-home policy, limiting business travel, providing allowances for home-office equipment, expanding leave programs, offering temporary financial flexibility to some customers and changing billing frequencies for new business, and sourcing personal protective equipment for medical personnel. Management recorded impairments to real estate leases as it continued to evaluate office space needs, redirected resources from areas that no longer align with business priorities into key growth and go-to-market initiatives, and invested in data center capacity, cybersecurity and privacy risk management, professional services and technology infrastructure to scale operations, facilitate customer adoption and preserve performance under disruption. Strategic realignments and acquisitions—including the integration of Vlocity and Tableau and the pending acquisition of Slack—have enabled service innovation, resource reconfiguration and the reconstitution of operational trajectories toward future growth. The launch of solutions such as Work.com, Work.com for Schools and Vaccine Cloud illustrates organizational adaptation and transformation, while ESG initiatives like renewable energy procurement, supplier science-based targets and emergency community support reflect systemic strategies to absorb strain, mitigate external pressures and maintain organizational integrity and long-term performance.

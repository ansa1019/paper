As the global response to novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) continues to evolve, our primary focus has been the safety and wellbeing of our employees and their families, as well as the seamless functioning of the firm in serving our limited partner investors and our shareholders. In accordance with local government guidance and social distancing recommendations, the majority of our employees globally have been working remotely, and our technology infrastructure has proven to be robust and capable of supporting this model. We have implemented rigorous protocols for remote work across the firm, including increased cadence of group calls and updates and frequent communication across leadership and working levels, and we are leveraging technology to ensure our teams stay connected and productive and that our culture remains strong even in these unusual circumstances. While we are generally not meeting with our clients in person, we continue to actively communicate through videoconference, teleconference and email, our investment committees continue to convene as needed, and the firm continues to operate across investment, asset management and corporate support functions. Since July 2020, employees in our U.S. and European offices began returning to the office on a voluntary basis, consistent with local government guidelines, with testing, contact-tracing, social distancing and other safety protocols in place, and we continue to closely monitor applicable public health and government guidance. We maintain multiple sources of liquidity to meet our capital needs, including annual cash flows, accumulated earnings, proceeds from issuances of senior notes, investments in corporate treasury securities and access to our committed revolving credit facility, and we believe these sources will be more than sufficient to fund working capital requirements, general partner and co-investment commitments, operating expenses, capital expenditures, borrowings, taxes, share repurchases and dividends. In our real estate segment, the majority of our aggregate global portfolio in BREP and core+ real estate businesses is in sectors we believe are more resilient to the impact of COVID-19, and in our private equity segment, the majority of our non-energy portfolio is in sectors we likewise view as resilient. Our hedge fund solutions segment largely recovered from first-quarter composite losses and benefited from the recovery of liquidity later in the year, and our credit & insurance segment has continued to actively manage portfolios to limit downside and protect capital, reflecting operational flexibility, risk mitigation and adaptability under challenging conditions.

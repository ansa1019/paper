During fiscal year 2020, we experienced COVID-19-related production and supply chain disruptions that impacted the timing of revenue recognition and gross margin, while improvements in our operations and those of our suppliers have begun to materialize amid ongoing pandemic-related risks. We maintain sufficient liquidity reserves—including $7.0 billion of cash, cash equivalents and investments, a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility with a $600 million expansion option and a back-stopped $1.25 billion commercial paper program—to support sustaining investment in research and development, capital infrastructure and operational continuity through at least the next twelve months, and we believe anticipated cash flows and capital market access will enable resource generation and risk mitigation. Our strategy to effectively leverage cycles of learning from our broad installed base, sustain engineering programs, product and process development and concept feasibility, and collaborate with ecosystem partners supports our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite external perturbations. The execution of multi-product solutions throughout semiconductor manufacturing, delivery solutions tailored to customers’ technical requirements and productivity needs during the equipment lifecycle, and our strong global presence with core competencies in nanoscale applications, chemistry, plasma and fluidics underpin our operational flexibility and adaptability in a competitive landscape marked by environmental turbulence and uncertainty. We recognize revenue upon transfer of performance obligations, allocate transaction prices to multiple performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis, and establish variable consideration estimates to maintain accounting integrity under uncertain conditions. Inventory is assessed each period for obsolescence or excess relative to management’s estimated usage requirements to preserve gross margin under market volatility, and warranty and long-lived assets are periodically evaluated for adjustments or impairments based on actual cost experience, customer demand shifts and fair value assessments. Deferred tax assets are monitored and valuation allowances adjusted to reflect realizability under evolving tax and market conditions, and long-term debt instruments, including convertible senior notes due 2041 and various senior notes due through 2060, retain redemption and conversion features that provide financial resilience. Non-cancelable operating leases and residual value guarantees for facilities, along with indemnification agreements and defined purchase obligations, ensure contingency support across our operations. Collectively, these capabilities and strategic tools reflect our systematic approach to risk assessment, resource reconfiguration, adaptation strategies and business continuity practices to maintain integrity and performance when facing adverse and exceptional conditions.

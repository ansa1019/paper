In fiscal 2020, the company leveraged its improved operating capabilities and resource flexibility to maintain continuity and performance under extreme conditions, rapidly reprioritizing objectives to protect associates and customers during the COVID-19 pandemic, deploying nearly $1.3 billion in safety and support measures (including discretionary bonuses, temporary wage increases and emergency paid leave), and extending $109 million in community and small-business relief; it quickly rolled out curbside pickup, mobile check-in, touchless buy-online-pickup-in-store lockers and an internal order-picking app, re-platformed lowes.com to the cloud to enhance site stability and achieve triple-digit online growth, reset U.S. stores to localize assortments and accelerate shopping speed, and launched a data-driven pro CRM tool to deepen relationships with professional customers; these operational adaptations were underpinned by strong cash flows from operations ($11.0 billion), undrawn revolving-credit capacity ($3.0 billion), strategic capital expenditures focused on omni-channel and store modernization initiatives, disciplined inventory and self-insurance reserve management to mitigate risk, and the introduction of the Total Home strategy to broaden products and services, all of which reflect the organizationâ€™s ability to absorb strain, reconfigure resources, innovate service delivery and preserve or improve functioning in a dynamic and uncertain business environment.

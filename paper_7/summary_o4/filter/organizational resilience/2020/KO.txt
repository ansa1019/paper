Throughout the report, the company describes numerous practices and initiatives that support the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including its “progress toward emerging stronger from the covid-19 pandemic” and its priorities of ensuring the health and safety of employees, supporting communities, keeping brands in supply and maintaining product quality, serving customers across all channels as they adapt to shifting consumer demands, and deploying global and regional teams to monitor local markets and recommend risk mitigation actions such as travel restrictions, social distancing, enhanced cleaning routines and remote work.  It emphasizes that “during times of crisis, business continuity and adapting to the needs of our customers are critical,” noting the development of “systemwide knowledge-sharing routines and processes, which include the management of any supply chain challenges,” partnerships with bottlers and retailers to ensure adequate inventory levels in key channels while prioritizing core brands and consumer affordability, and rapid investments in e-commerce, fit-for-purpose package sizes for online sales and digital consumer and trade promotions.  The company states its belief that it “will come out of this situation a better and stronger company,” having identified key objectives—winning more consumers, gaining market share, maintaining strong system economics, strengthening stakeholder impact and equipping the organization to win—and having leveraged the crisis as a catalyst to accelerate strategy through focused priorities such as optimizing its portfolio of global, regional and local brands, establishing a disciplined innovation framework, increasing consumer-centric marketing effectiveness and efficiency, strengthening data-driven revenue growth management and execution capabilities, enhancing system collaboration and capturing supply chain efficiencies, and evolving the organization and investing in new capabilities.  In August 2020, the company further announced strategic steps to transform its organizational structure into a networked global organization designed to combine the power of scale with the deep local knowledge required to win, and it underscores its commitment to remain flexible in adjusting to near-term uncertainties while continuing to execute those initiatives.  The report also highlights the company’s strong cash-flow generation from operating activities, its prudent debt management and supply-chain finance programs, extensions of payment terms with suppliers to enhance working capital efficiency, and a liquidity position it deems sufficient to support its operations, investing and financing activities through 2021 and beyond—all of which collectively illustrate the company’s ability to absorb strain, preserve core functions and adapt its structures and processes to sustain performance under adversity.

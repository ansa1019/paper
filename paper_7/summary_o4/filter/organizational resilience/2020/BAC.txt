In response to the pandemic, the corporation invoked its enterprise response framework to execute business continuity plans and processes, centralize crisis management and integrate its response across all businesses and functions, convening the CEO and an executive response team of senior executives to drive decisions, communications and consistency, while coordinating with authorities such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization; it implemented a global work-from-home posture supported by pre-planned contingency strategies for site-based operations, continuously evaluated and refined these continuity plans and remote-work strategy, and leveraged its business continuity capabilities to service clients and meet their financial needs, including through consumer and commercial loan modifications, repayment deferrals, forbearance programs and participation in SBA-guaranteed PPP and Main Street Lending programs; employees were supported with health and safety protocols, and the corporation managed increased operational risk tied to the execution of its business continuity plans under the enterprise response framework; liquidity management is underpinned by contingency funding plans and a capital contingency plan, including scenario-based stress testing, diversification of global liquidity sources and the establishment of NB Holdings to support a single-point-of-entry resolution strategy; strategic, capital and financial operating plans incorporate risk appetite limits approved by the board and the enterprise risk committee, which oversees an enterprise risk framework that integrates strategic, credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance and reputational risks; the corporation conducts forward-looking capital scenario management, stress forecasting and scenario analyses, and manages interest-rate and foreign-exchange exposures through asset-liability management activities that hedge cash-flow variability; an enterprise-wide IBOR transition program led by senior management and monitored by the enterprise risk committee mitigates operational disruptions; and together these multifaceted measures—from business continuity protocols and contingency planning to stress testing, governance and diversified funding and hedging—form a resilience strategy designed to preserve the organization’s integrity, functioning and performance under challenging and unexpected conditions.

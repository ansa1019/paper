During the significant challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company demonstrated its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning by focusing on the health and safety of patients, customers, communities, and employees through continuous updates to health and safety policies; by supporting customers’ clinical, operational, and economic priorities with an April 2020 customer relief program that provided service fee credits, deferred lease payments, and extended payment terms while monitoring and mitigating credit risks; by working closely with suppliers and distributors to ensure continuity of supply and by building inventory buffers to address potential trade- or supply-chain disruptions; by securing its workforce economically and retaining key personnel deemed critical to the recovery phase; and by continuing to invest in priority development programs while eliminating avoidable spend. The Company also maintained positive adjustment under challenging conditions by offering flexible system leasing and usage-based models to provide customers with operational and financial agility, leveraging internet-connected system logs and telementoring tools to access real-time utilization data for financial and operational decision-making, and by using metrics such as installed base, shipment volumes, and procedure utilization as leading indicators of adoption and future recurring revenue. In its product development and manufacturing operations, the Company pursued design and production investments—exemplified by its Extended Use program, which increased instrument durability through enhanced quality and production capabilities—and continued to optimize training pathways and supply chains to enable measured, phased rollouts of new systems and platforms. Furthermore, within its integrated ecosystem, the Company took a holistic, systems-oriented approach to decrease variability in minimally invasive surgery by offering dependable, consistent functionality and user experiences, thereby reinforcing organizational resilience through system integrity, operational continuity, adaptability to fluctuating procedure volumes, and ongoing strategic investment in manufacturing automation, informatics platforms, and workforce capabilities.

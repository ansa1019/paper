During 2020, Abbott demonstrated organizational resilience by mobilizing cross‐functional teams across its diagnostics platforms to rapidly develop and launch multiple molecular, serology, antigen and multiplex tests under emergency use authorizations while simultaneously executing comprehensive business continuity plans—shifting office‐based work to remote and rotational on‐site arrangements, enforcing strict travel restrictions and enhancing facility safety in alignment with evolving governmental directives—to maintain integrity and performance under exceptional conditions. The company’s diversified portfolio and operational flexibility enabled significant volume growth in diagnostics and nutritional products despite pronounced declines in routine laboratory testing and cardiovascular and neuromodulation procedures, with recovery trajectories varying by geography in response to the local progression of COVID-19. Abbott reconfigured its manufacturing capacity to meet surging demand for COVID-19 diagnostics, proactively managed working capital and cash flows to achieve record net cash from operations, preserved liquidity through investment-grade debt ratings and committed credit facilities, and strengthened its balance sheet by issuing and repaying long-term notes to optimize its capital structure. Concurrently, Abbott reallocated research and development resources—immediately expensing acquired R&D assets and focusing investments across medical devices, diagnostics, nutritionals and established pharmaceuticals—while executing integration and restructuring initiatives to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs, thereby supporting positive adjustment under challenging conditions, risk mitigation, resource reconfiguration and sustained firm performance in a turbulent environment.

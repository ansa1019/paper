In 2020, Stryker’s organizational resilience was evidenced by its ability to maintain operations and adjust resource deployment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic’s severe disruptions to global suppliers, vendors, distributors and manufacturing facilities and the postponement of elective medical procedures that negatively affected its business, cash flows and financial condition. The Company implemented operating expense savings actions, suspended its share repurchase program, charges related to in-process asset impairments and other exit costs resulting from pandemic-related constraints, and exercised its credit facility acquisition clause to increase permitted leverage to 5.0:1, thereby reconfiguring its capital structure to absorb strain, preserve liquidity and fund strategic acquisitions of Wright and OrthoSensor. Stryker’s systemic perspective on business continuity was reflected in sustained cash generation from operations, supplemented by debt issuance and maintained revolving credit facilities with strong investment-grade ratings to support short-term liquidity, operational flexibility and emergency funding. The use of non-GAAP financial measures—such as adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating income and percentage sales growth in constant currency—provided a baseline for trend analysis and risk mitigation, while continued investments in research, development and engineering, integration of recent acquisitions and critical accounting policies on inventory reserves, impairment testing, legal contingencies and uncertain tax positions underpinned its capacity to absorb external pressures, preserve integrity and maintain performance under challenging conditions.

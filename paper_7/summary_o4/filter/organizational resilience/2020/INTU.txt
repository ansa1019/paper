In fiscal 2020, following the World Health Organization’s declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic, the Company conducted business with substantial modifications to employee work locations, travel and platform operations to maintain continuity and preserve functioning under adversity, even as the full impact of the pandemic on demand, customer and partner operations, and government actions remained uncertain and subject to the Company’s disclosed risk factors. Management has underscored the critical importance of ongoing operation and availability of its platforms and those of its external service providers, reflecting a systemic perspective on resilience, and continues to allocate significant resources and attention to its information technology infrastructure, privacy and security capabilities, including enhanced security and industry-wide anti-fraud measures in collaboration with state and federal authorities. Seasonal shifts prompted by IRS deadline extensions required operational adaptability and reconfigured revenue and working capital trajectories between quarters, while the Company’s generation of substantial cash from operations and its access to amended unsecured and secured revolving credit facilities and term loans have fortified its liquidity to absorb strain, fund research and development, selling and marketing activities, capital projects, acquisitions (including the pending Credit Karma transaction) and debt service, and to respond rapidly to strategic opportunities. The issuance of $2 billion of senior unsecured notes for general corporate purposes, the temporary suspension of share repurchases, the quarterly review of legal proceedings and uncertain tax positions, and the ongoing evaluation of potential business combinations and strategic investments further demonstrate the Company’s proactive resource reconfiguration, risk mitigation mechanisms and strategic agility to foresee, confront and benefit from disruptive events, thereby preserving system integrity and enabling positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

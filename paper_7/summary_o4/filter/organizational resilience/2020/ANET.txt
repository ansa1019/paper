Arista Networks emphasizes the importance of evolving and adapting to a rapidly changing environment, noting that “our future success is dependent upon our ability to continue to evolve and adapt to our rapidly changing environment” through investments in research and development to “enhance the functionality of our existing cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features, and build upon our technology leadership” and by maintaining a highly scalable and programmable platform “purpose built to address the functional and performance requirements for cloud networks, including workflow automation, network visibility and analytics,” thus supporting business continuity under pressures of market volatility. The Company acknowledges the unpredictability of large customer orders and expects “continued variability in our customer concentration and timing of sales on a quarterly and annual basis,” and further highlights actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic—prioritizing employee protection by closing offices, instructing employees to work from home and implementing travel restrictions, while “working closely with our contract manufacturers and supply chain partners” and “funding additional working capital and incremental purchase commitments” to mitigate supply chain disruptions. Arista reports that although it initially experienced demand volatility, “sales activity subsequently stabilized and we experienced incremental improvements in overall demand as the year progressed,” and it has “continued to carefully review our investment and spending plans, cautiously increasing incremental spending…as overall customer demand stabilized,” reflecting resource reallocation and risk mitigation. The firm also increased inventory by $235.3 million “to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 related supply chain disruptions” and expects to “continue to invest in working capital as supply availability improves,” demonstrating foresight, preparedness and capacity to absorb strain while preserving operations. Arista maintains a strong liquidity position with $2.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and holds that these resources, together with cash from operations, “will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and our growth strategies for at least the next 12 months,” underlining its commitment to sustain performance and emerge stronger from adverse events.

Disruptions at some of our manufacturing operations and facilities due to travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns have impacted and likely will continue to impact our workforce and operations, and since the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2020 our manufacturing operations and supply chain generally stabilized at normal levels, reflecting the organization’s adaptability and operational flexibility under pressure, although the COVID-19 situation remains dynamic. We have modified our business practices, including restricting employee travel, modifying employee work locations and cancelling physical participation in meetings, events and conferences, and may take further actions as required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers and shareholders. While we are confident that our strategy and long-term contingency planning have positioned us well to weather the current uncertainty, we cannot at this time fully quantify or forecast the impact of COVID-19 on our business. We monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis and assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and alignment of expenses with revenues, and as a result have undertaken various restructuring actions, including repositioning our global workforce to better align with our long-term strategic plan and redeploying reductions in salary and benefits to other areas of the business, as well as consolidating wafer and test facility operations acquired in business combinations—actions we expect will result in estimated annual salary, variable compensation and employee benefit savings of approximately $60.0 million. We believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential to maintain product leadership and to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore expect to continue to make significant R&D investments in the future. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, transaction costs associated with our proposed acquisition of Maxim and dividend payments (if any) in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, diversify across high-credit-quality counterparties to minimize credit risk and manage worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds held by our foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness of repatriation. The planned suspension and reinstatement of our common stock repurchase program and our revolving credit facility, which provides for up to $1.25 billion of borrowings maturing in 2024 with a leverage covenant of 3.5 to 1.0, further demonstrate our strategic agility, resourcefulness and preparedness to manage uncertainties, preserve operational continuity and sustain performance under pressure.

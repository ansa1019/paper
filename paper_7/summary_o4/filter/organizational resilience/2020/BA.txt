Boeing’s management reports that in response to the unprecedented demand shock from the COVID-19 pandemic and the residual impacts of the 737 MAX grounding, the company has strategically reduced production rates across its Commercial Airplanes programs based on ongoing assessments of market demand and financing availability, maintained a disciplined rate-management process with adjustments to delivery schedules and accounting quantities, and implemented enhanced safety protocols—such as remote work, physical-distancing schedules and increased facility cleaning—to safeguard employees while managing higher operating costs. To fortify business continuity and organizational resilience, Boeing launched a multi-year business transformation structured around five pillars—consolidating infrastructure to align facilities and office space with reduced demand, rightsizing the workforce and simplifying organizational layers, prioritizing its portfolio and investments by reducing R&D and capital expenditures, stabilizing supply-chain health through indirect-spend reductions and streamlined logistics, and driving operational excellence via quality improvements, rework reduction and strategic vendor partnerships—all aimed at optimizing processes and emerging stronger when markets recover. In parallel, the company has taken significant liquidity-preservation actions, including securing $36 billion of new debt under revolving and term facilities, suspending share repurchases and dividends, and substituting equity for cash contributions to pension and 401(k) plans to conserve over $1 billion of cash, while continuing to monitor global trade developments, contract contingencies and certification timelines to mitigate risks, absorb strain, preserve integrity and performance under adversity, and position itself to rebound more robustly from disruptive events.

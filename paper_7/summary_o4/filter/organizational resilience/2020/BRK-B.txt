Through an unusually decentralized management structure with few centralized or integrated business functions, our diverse operating subsidiaries have demonstrated adaptability by implementing comprehensive business continuity plans in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including temporary closures of non-essential retail stores, manufacturing facilities and service centers, work-from-home protocols, staggered or reduced work schedules, enhanced sanitation and health screenings, elimination of non-essential travel and meetings, and general health reminders to protect employees and customers.  In parallel, actions such as employee furloughs, wage and salary reductions, capital spending cuts and other measures were taken to mitigate economic losses, preserve capital and liquidity, and maintain critical service levels, while certain businesses have undertaken and may continue restructuring activities to resize operations in line with expected customer demand.  Underwriting results in 2020 reflected pandemic-related impacts, including premium credits under the GEICO Giveback program, reduced claims frequencies, increased loss estimates for commercial and casualty reinsurance, provisions for uncollectible premiums and incremental operating costs to sustain customer service, with the GEICO Giveback program alone reducing premiums written by approximately $2.9 billion through a 15% credit on renewals and new policies between April 8 and October 7, 2020.  As an essential business, BNSF continued operating throughout the pandemic, leveraging ample liquidity to absorb volume declines and economic disruptions, while railroad operating expenses in 2020 declined through cost control initiatives, productivity improvements and favorable weather conditions.  We cannot reliably predict the pandemicâ€™s future economic effects, the timing of normalization across our numerous and diverse operations or the potential alteration of consumption patterns, underscoring our ongoing commitment to flexibility, risk mitigation and the preservation of organizational integrity under extreme and evolving conditions.

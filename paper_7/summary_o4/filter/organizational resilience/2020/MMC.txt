The Company’s MD&A discloses a range of measures and capabilities that support its ability to maintain performance under challenging conditions, including Marsh’s and Guy Carpenter’s provision of innovative risk management and reinsurance capital strategies, the rapid implementation of travel restrictions, remote-work capabilities and flexible work policies to safeguard colleagues and ensure business continuity during the COVID-19 pandemic, the disciplined expense management and cost containment actions that partially mitigated revenue declines, and the dynamic reopening of offices in accordance with evolving governmental guidelines. It describes the ongoing integration and restructuring of the JLT acquisition, which has generated significant cost savings and improved operational efficiency through severance, real-estate rationalization, technology investments and consulting engagements, as well as the use of foreign exchange, interest rate and other derivative contracts to hedge against currency and interest rate fluctuations and preserve capital. The Company highlights its maintenance of diversified liquidity and capital resources— including multi-currency revolving credit, term loan and commercial paper programs, senior note issuances and share repurchase authorizations—designed to provide financial flexibility and support strategic initiatives. It further outlines its pension funding and asset-allocation approach to meet statutory requirements and optimize long-term returns, the management of contractual obligations and contingent liabilities, and the recognition that the ultimate impact of external uncertainties, including government-imposed restrictions and evolving pandemic conditions, cannot be precisely predicted, all of which collectively illustrate its systemic perspective on resilience, adaptability and preservation of operational integrity in a dynamic and uncertain environment.

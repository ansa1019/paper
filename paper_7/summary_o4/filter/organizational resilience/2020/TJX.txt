During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company temporarily closed all of its stores, online businesses, distribution centers and offices for approximately 24% of fiscal 2021, furloughed the majority of its hourly store and distribution associates while maintaining benefits coverage and deployed remote work arrangements, actions which reflect its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adverse conditions. Upon reopening, the Company implemented enhanced health and safety practices—including personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning regimens, social distancing and occupancy limits, protective shields at registers, modified merchandise handling and signage protocols—to maintain continuity and mitigate risks in a rapidly changing environment. It established global task force teams, continues to monitor government requirements and consumer behaviour, and realigned its European division’s supply chain to address new Brexit regulatory and compliance requirements, thereby reconfiguring operational processes and resource deployment to sustain performance amidst external pressures. Financially, management generated $4.6 billion of operating cash flows, increased liquidity through a $500 million 364-day revolving credit facility and the issuance of $7.75 billion aggregate principal amount of notes, negotiated rent deferrals and extended payment terms on merchandise orders, suspended share repurchases, deferred dividends and optimized accounts payable and inventory positions, demonstrating dynamic capability and resourcefulness in maintaining system integrity and mitigating asset impairment risks. Capital spending plans were adjusted to allocate $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion for investments in infrastructure, distribution centers, new and renovated stores, illustrating proactive measures for future orientation and resilience engineering. Inventory valued under the retail method was marked down to reflect temporary store closures and perishable write-offs, and impairment assessments were triggered for operating lease right-of-use assets and store fixed assets, further evidencing risk assessment and impact management. The continued operation and planned expansion of its e-commerce platforms—including marmaxx.com, sierra.com and the forthcoming homegoods.com—along with real-time mark-to-market hedging of inventory-related foreign currency derivatives, underscore the Company’s strategic agility, service innovation and commitment to business continuity in the face of internal and external disturbances.

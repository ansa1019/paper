During the pandemic, we directed our teams to work from home, suspend travel and replace in-person events such as Adobe Summit and MAX with digital events through July 2021, thereby “promoting employee health and safety, serving our customers and ensuring business continuity,” while capitalizing on the accelerated macro trend toward digital engagement. We completed the acquisition and integration of Workfront, Allegorithmic, Marketo and Magento into our digital experience and digital media reportable segments, allocating purchase price to tangible and intangible assets via significant estimates and assumptions to align resource deployment with our strategic priorities. Our subscription-based business model, with ratable recognition of Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Adobe Experience Cloud services, and our cash flow hedging program mitigate revenue volatility and support operational flexibility. We regularly evaluate critical accounting policies and estimates related to revenue recognition judgments, deferred revenue obligations and income tax provisioning, and maintain sufficient liquidity through a diversified investment portfolio, a $1 billion revolving credit facility and structured stock repurchase agreements to meet working capital, capital expenditure, acquisition and shareholder return requirements. The realignment of our advertising cloud offerings into a new publishing and advertising segment further reconfigures our organizational structure to reflect strategic shifts and sustain system integrity under evolving market conditions.

Boston Scientific’s management detailed how, as the COVID-19 pandemic spread and disrupted hospital operations globally, many elective and semi-emergent procedures were postponed or banned while other jurisdictions developed protocols to conduct such procedures safely, negatively impacting net sales and operating results. In response, the company implemented cost-reduction initiatives including decreases in travel, meetings, customer events, hiring, clinical programs and certain R&D projects, instituted a temporary four-day work week and executive compensation reductions, and temporarily closed or reduced production levels at certain manufacturing sites to align build plans with demand. As COVID cases declined mid-year, a careful, tiered approach was adopted for employee site returns—first bringing back those needing onsite resources and enabling remote work to maximize social distancing—and by year-end all plants had resumed more normalized manufacturing levels. Since the onset of the pandemic, a global crisis management team has focused on protecting employees and customers, optimizing operations, securing the supply chain and successfully implementing business continuity plans that included establishing a medical advisory group, leveraging work-from-home infrastructure, limiting sales visits to critical cases and accelerating remote physician support capabilities. Recognizing the uncertainty of the pandemic’s duration and economic impact, management also took proactive steps to preserve liquidity and support recovery, including managing outstanding borrowings, amending financial covenants, slowing planned capital expenditures, completing public offerings and senior-note issuances to increase liquidity, creating a cross-functional strategic cash management team to optimize funds, investing excess cash in diversified short-term instruments to mitigate principal risk, and maintaining full access to credit facilities. Despite near-term challenges, management affirmed that long-term fundamentals remain strong and the company will manage through disruptions with strategic focus and the collective spirit of its global team, presuming its existing balance of cash, future cash flows, capital market access and credit facilities will fund operations, infrastructure investments, legal and tax liabilities and debt service for at least the next 12 months.

During 2020, AMD demonstrated operational flexibility and adaptability by delivering strong financial results and extending its industry-leading product portfolio despite the Covid-19 pandemic, experiencing limited financial disruption while maintaining normal business operations under local health measures; although many offices remained open for critical on-site functions, most employees worked from home throughout the year and, during the second half of 2020, the majority in China returned on-site, with management continuing to monitor and take measures to protect employee health and safety and support remote productivity. Management monitored demand signals and adjusted supply chain requirements, product schedules and roadmaps to support remote-working requirements and address geographic and market demand shifts caused by the pandemic. In its liquidity and capital resources planning, AMD believed that cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and its revolving credit facility would be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and anticipated access to capital markets if required. Net cash provided by operating activities of $1.1 billion in 2020 was primarily driven by net income adjusted for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities, reflecting resource allocation to support working capital needs. As part of its strategic resilience initiatives to reinforce its high-performance computing leadership, AMD entered into a definitive agreement in October 2020 to acquire Xilinx, Inc. in an all-stock transaction.

In response to the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, the company has maintained near-full staffing and normal capacity at its global sites while remaining prepared to curtail production or alter business operations as necessary to safeguard employees, customers, suppliers and stakeholders and preserve operational continuity.  The company has implemented health screenings, physical distancing, team separation protocols, facility equipment upgrades, visitor prohibitions, reduced business travel and work-from-home requirements, along with thermal scanning and mandatory masking on site, to protect organizational health and enable safe, continued functioning.  To adapt to shifting demand patterns, the company has reallocated supply from markets experiencing declines (smartphones, consumer electronics, desktop PCs, automotive and enterprise) to those with increased demand (data center infrastructure, cloud servers, notebooks and gaming), evaluated its supply chain to identify gaps, engaged alternative suppliers and increased on-hand raw material inventories, and added assembly and test capacity through captive operations and external partners to provide redundant manufacturing capability.  Management has developed and is implementing strategies to address a variety of potential economic scenarios, including limitations on new hiring, business travel restrictions and reductions in discretionary spending, while working closely with government authorities to monitor operations, comply with regulations, industry standards and best practices, and safeguard team members and communities.  The company continuously evaluates alternatives to fund capital expenditures and operations, expects its cash and investments, operating cash flows and available financing to be sufficient through the next twelve months, and plans capital expenditures of approximately $9 billion in 2021 focused on technology transitions and product enablement.  In addition, the board has authorized a discretionary repurchase of up to $10 billion of common stock, providing financial flexibility and strategic agility to support business continuity, performance maintenance and growth under challenging and uncertain conditions.

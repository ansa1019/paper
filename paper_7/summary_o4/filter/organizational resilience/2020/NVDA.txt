Management’s discussion acknowledges that our products are manufactured based on estimates of customers’ future demand and extended manufacturing lead times, which may give rise to significant mismatches between supply and demand, and in periods of constrained capacity and component availability we may place non-cancellable orders, pay premiums or provide deposits to secure future supply. The report describes the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic as prompting unprecedented travel restrictions, business closures, quarantines and shelter-in-place orders that have significantly disrupted global economic activity and financial markets, and it notes that since March 2020 most employees have worked remotely with most business travel prohibited. The company cites stronger demand in its gaming and data center market platforms as people work, learn and play from home, continued benefits to mobile workstation demand in professional visualization, and a partial recovery in desktop workstation demand, while warning that ongoing pandemic conditions may materially and negatively affect customer demand, supply-chain availability and logistics. In response to environmental perturbations and external pressures, we changed our reportable segments to Graphics and Compute & Networking, reassigning goodwill based on relative fair values and confirming no impairment, while preserving unchanged market platforms across gaming, professional visualization, data center, automotive and OEM. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources—including existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $11.56 billion as of January 31, 2021 (including $1.38 billion held outside the U.S.), our unused $575 million credit agreement and $575 million commercial paper program, and access to public debt markets with notes maturing through 2060—to ensure sufficient funds for working capital, capital asset purchases, dividends, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months and to adapt our capital structure in changing conditions. In estimating demand, evaluating trends, recognizing revenue and accounting for business combinations, inventory, goodwill, income taxes and customer programs, we employ significant judgments and ongoing assumptions based on historical experience, internal and external data, and risk-adjusted discount rates, subject to periodic reassessment and measurement-period adjustments, thereby preserving financial integrity, operational continuity and the ability to absorb strain and maintain performance under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

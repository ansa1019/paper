Throughout 2020 and 2019, Schwab maintained structured processes and resources to preserve its operational integrity and performance amid internal and external disruptions, including the rapid escalation of the COVID-19 pandemic and the integration of multiple acquisitions. Management’s enterprise risk management framework, approved by the board, incorporates defined risk appetite statements and a global risk committee—supported by functional sub-committees for operational, compliance, financial, model, and conduct risk—to identify, assess, monitor, and mitigate emerging risks and ensure business continuity. Schwab’s operational resilience is further supported by its backup and recovery infrastructure, geographically dispersed workforce, routine testing of disaster-recovery and business-continuity plans, and incident-management program. Through comprehensive liquidity and capital stress testing, along with contingency planning and regular scenario analyses (including parallel and non-parallel interest-rate shocks), Schwab ensures sufficient funding and capital buffers to absorb balance-sheet strains, maintain integrity of its banking and broker-dealer subsidiaries, and meet regulatory requirements. The company has established detailed policies for interest-rate risk management—covering net interest revenue and economic value of equity limits—and has enacted a firm-wide LIBOR transition plan to secure appropriate fallback provisions. Schwab also deploys tightly controlled processes for managing credit exposures in its investment and lending portfolios, while maintaining diversified funding sources that include client deposits, repurchase agreements, and committed credit facilities. Information-security, fraud-prevention, data-privacy, and internal-controls programs, together with mandated training and contractual requirements for third parties, preserve system integrity under cybersecurity and operational threats. Specialized policies address model-risk governance, incentive-compensation risk, fiduciary duties, and regulatory compliance, with structured escalation to the board’s risk and compliance committees. Throughout unprecedented market volatility and remote-work conditions, Schwab responded by increasing technology investments, expanding client-service staffing, and executing strategic initiatives to drive scale and segmentation, thereby preserving client engagement, service levels, and financial performance under challenging conditions.

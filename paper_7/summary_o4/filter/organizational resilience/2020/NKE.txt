Since fiscal 2018, through the consumer direct offense and our triple-double strategy, we have focused on doubling the impact of innovation, increasing our speed and agility to market and growing our direct connections with consumers. In June 2020, we announced consumer direct acceleration, which will focus on three areas: creating the marketplace of the future through more premium, consistent and seamless consumer experiences; aligning our product creation and category organizations around a new men’s, women’s and kids’ construct to better meet individual consumer needs; and unifying investments in data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering, inventory management and other areas against an end-to-end technology foundation to accelerate our digital transformation. To manage future inventory growth and ensure a return to normalized levels, we are modifying our buying plans and canceling certain pre-COVID-19 factory purchases, shifting product offer dates to meet near-term demand, reallocating available inventory into our digital channel and increasing digital fulfillment capacity, while investing in targeted promotions and markdowns to accelerate liquidation of excess inventory and protect the long-term health of our product franchises. In response to the uncertainty of the pandemic, we enhanced our liquidity position by issuing $6 billion in senior unsecured notes, temporarily suspending our share repurchase program and entering into a new committed credit facility agreement for an additional $2 billion of borrowings. Throughout the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020, our digital commerce remained open, supported by employees in our distribution centers, and Nike brand digital grew 79 percent on a currency-neutral basis even as physical stores gradually began reopening. We continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation and guidance from public health authorities, may take additional actions based on their recommendations and acknowledge that developments outside our control may require us to adjust our operating plan. Despite material adverse impacts on revenue growth, profitability and inventory levels, we remain committed to executing our long-term financial goals by optimizing country operating models, shifting to a distributor operating model in certain Latin America markets to better serve consumers and drive profitability, streamlining our operating model to optimize effectiveness and investing in end-to-end digital capabilities—including a new enterprise resource planning tool—to accelerate growth, unlock efficiency and drive speed and responsiveness as we serve consumers globally.

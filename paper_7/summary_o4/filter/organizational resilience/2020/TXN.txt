The company has long maintained a business continuity plan for unforeseeable situations, like the COVID-19 pandemic, and has invested in building inventory and expanding its global internally owned manufacturing footprint to provide flexibility, such as the ability to build products across multiple manufacturing sites, thereby helping to minimize disruptions; its strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth is built on a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology that provides lower costs and greater control of the supply chain, a broad analog and embedded processing portfolio that offers more opportunity per customer and deeper insight into customer needs, and the diversity and longevity of its products, markets and customer positions to reduce single-point dependency and extend returns on investments, all of which collectively serve to absorb strain and preserve performance under external pressures; management applies discipline in allocating capital to research and development projects, manufacturing capacity, digital capabilities and acquisitions while returning cash to shareholders, and remains diligent in pursuing efficiencies to strengthen its systemic capabilities and adaptability; the company continuously monitors and assesses uncertainties affecting its business, supply chain and customer demand and relies on cash flow from operations, cash and short-term investments and an undrawn $2 billion revolving credit facility to ensure sufficient financial resources and operating plans to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividends and debt-related payments for at least the next twelve months; in 2020 it reorganized its analog segment into power and signal chain product lines to simplify its business structure without impacting consolidated financial results, demonstrating operational flexibility and resource reconfiguration; and in its inventory valuation process it establishes quarterly statistical and specific allowances based on historical disposals, current backlog and estimated future sales to identify items at risk of obsolescence, thus preserving organizational integrity and performance across varying demand conditions.

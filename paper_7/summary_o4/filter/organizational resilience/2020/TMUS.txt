The MD&A describes multiple initiatives that embody the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions by demonstrating the company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity, including the post-merger integration that enhanced our spectrum portfolio, increased our customer base, altered our product mix and created opportunities for synergies in network, retail, information technology and back-office operations, with an anticipated initial increase in operating costs expected to decrease as we realize those synergies; restructuring activities to achieve cost efficiencies through the rationalization of retail stores, severance of redundant processes and functions, decommissioning of small cell sites and distributed antenna systems, and ongoing evaluation of additional initiatives dependent on counterpart consultations; the designation as critical communications infrastructure provider driving a systemic focus on business continuity and organizational health during the COVID-19 pandemic by ensuring crucial connectivity for customers and impacted communities while protecting employee well-being through remote work arrangements, supplemental pay and health and sanitation protocols; crisis response measures to maintain service under economic pressure, including not terminating service or imposing late fees on residential or small business customers, providing unlimited high-speed data and additional mobile hotspot allowances, empowering digital learning programs, free international calling and creative COVID-safe solutions such as virtual selling, curbside pickup and temporary deployment of additional spectrum to double LTE capacity; ongoing monitoring and adjustment of marketing, capital, travel and third-party spend in light of uncertainty; and the deployment of diversified liquidity and financing tools—including vendor financing, credit facilities, debt issuances and cash-flow measures—to support operational flexibility, resource reconfiguration, network expansion, spectrum acquisitions and overall resilience in the face of internal or external disruptions.

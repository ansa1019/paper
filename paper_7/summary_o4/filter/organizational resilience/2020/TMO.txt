In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company mobilized in early 2020 to support the global response with products and services that help analyze, diagnose and protect from the virus, while simultaneously noting significant reductions in customer activity in several businesses by late March 2020 that materially affected the analytical instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, other segments, with the extent and duration of negative impacts depending in part on the success of global efforts to control the pandemic and economic activity ramping up. Despite these uncertainties, management believes the impacted businesses’ long-term prospects remain excellent given attractive markets served, its industry-leading position and proven growth strategy. Resources were reallocated to ramp production of testing and treatment-related products, resulting in $6.63 billion of COVID-19–related product sales in 2020, and strategic growth investments—targeted spending to enhance commercial capabilities including geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, focused research and development projects and employee incentives—combined with productivity improvements from its practical process improvement business system, global sourcing initiatives, restructuring actions and low-cost region manufacturing, supported performance maintenance and future orientation. The company strengthened its liquidity and operational flexibility, increasing consolidated working capital to $11.65 billion (including $10.33 billion of cash and cash equivalents) as of December 31, 2020 compared with $5.70 billion a year earlier, and maintaining access to a $3.00 billion unsecured revolving credit facility while reserving undrawn capacity equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to ensure business continuity. Its strategy to augment internal growth with complementary acquisitions and selective divestitures enabled reconfiguration of its four segments and improved resource deployment, while continuous risk assessment—through quarterly and annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing, evaluation of indicators such as unexpected adverse business conditions and economic factors, and accruals for contingencies based on probabilistic judgments—helps preserve system integrity under internal or external variations. Forward-looking capital and tax planning actions, including foreign tax credit planning in Sweden, judicious management of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and intent to reinvest non-U.S. earnings indefinitely, are designed to optimize financial resources and support the firm’s ability to absorb strain, adapt to disruptions and maintain functioning under challenging conditions. The company anticipates that its existing cash and cash equivalents, future operating cash flow and borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months, and expects capital expenditures of $2.2–$2.4 billion in 2021.

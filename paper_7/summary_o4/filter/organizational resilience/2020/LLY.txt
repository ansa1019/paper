In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, management has focused on maintaining a reliable supply of medicines, reducing strain on the medical system, protecting employee health, supporting communities, and ensuring affordability and access to medicines while adapting clinical trial starts by pausing and resuming enrollment as conditions permitted, actions that reflect the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions. The company navigated decreases in new prescriptions and changes in payer mix, incurred increased development expenses for COVID-19 therapies, and shifted to virtual interactions to protect healthcare providers and employees, yet largely maintained normal operations without material impairments to assets or liquidity. Liquidity and financial resilience have been bolstered by generating operating cash flow, increasing cash and cash equivalents, access to committed bank credit facilities and commercial paper markets, and managing the balance between fixed and floating rate debt as well as hedging foreign currency exposures to mitigate fluctuations in interest and exchange rates. Strategic resilience initiatives include continuous evaluation of business development transactions, acquisitions of companies such as Loxo, Dermira and Prevail to strengthen the pipeline, dynamic allocation of research and development spending to balance risks across projects, and disciplined risk management processes for product litigation accruals, asset impairment reviews, and critical accounting estimates. The company’s proactive risk mitigation mechanisms extend to protecting its global supply chain, adjusting manufacturing and distribution systems, and employing derivative instruments to offset financial exposures, all supporting the maintenance of performance under environmental disruptions and uncertainties while preserving operational flexibility, resource deployment, and future orientation toward sustainable business continuity and system integrity.

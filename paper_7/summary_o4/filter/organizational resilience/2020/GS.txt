We prepare a balance sheet plan that combines our projected total assets and composition of assets with our expected funding sources over a three-year time horizon, which is reviewed quarterly and may be adjusted in response to changing business needs or market conditions, and we conduct various scenario analyses—both short- and long-term—using macroeconomic and firm-specific assumptions to dynamically manage our assets and liabilities. As part of our capital planning and stress testing process, we project sources and uses of capital under a range of business environments, including severely stressed conditions, and maintain a contingency capital plan that provides a framework for analyzing and responding to a perceived or actual capital deficiency by identifying drivers, mitigants and potential actions. In liquidity risk management, we hold unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash in our global core liquid assets to meet potential cash and collateral needs in a stressed environment, pre-funding estimated outflows over a 30-day horizon, and maintain a contingency funding plan that outlines risk factors, key metrics and detailed responses—such as pre-funding cash needs and utilizing secondary liquidity sources—and assigns clear responsibilities for execution and communication during a liquidity crisis. Our business continuity response to the COVID-19 pandemic was managed by a central team, enabling the majority of our employees to work remotely without disruption; strict protocols were established for safely re-opening offices, including physical distancing, enhanced cleaning and on-site testing, and our systems and infrastructure remained robust, allowing us to conduct all activities without interruption. Throughout the pandemic, senior management maintained regular and active communication with employees and the board and disciplined decision-making, while we granted payment forbearance to eligible corporate and other borrowers and provided relief programs to help consumers manage financial challenges. Our enterprise risk management framework, overseen by the board and its risk committees and supported by independent risk, compliance and model risk functions, employs firm-wide stress tests covering financial and non-financial risks, risk appetite statements, limits and continuous monitoring to ensure that we remain adequately capitalized and liquid, absorb strain and preserve core operations under adverse and uncertain conditions.

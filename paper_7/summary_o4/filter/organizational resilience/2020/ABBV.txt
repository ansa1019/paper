Following the closing of the Allergan acquisition, Abbvie implemented an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization and realize more than $2 billion of expected annual cost synergies over a three-year period—approximately 50 percent in R&D, 40 percent in SG&A and 10 percent in cost of products sold—supported by severance, retention and other integration expenses through 2022. The company’s strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, maximizing the benefits of the Allergan acquisition, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Abbvie continues to closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources around the world to help ensure that patients continue to receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines, while monitoring new patient starts, assessing the uncertainty of future impacts and maintaining robust liquidity through a $4 billion five-year revolving credit facility and access to commercial paper. Abbvie pursues strategic initiatives to diversify its revenue base with multiple long-term growth drivers, leverage commercial strength and international infrastructure across therapeutic areas, expand operating margins via productivity and efficiency programs, optimize combined research, development and manufacturing operations, invest in and expand its pipeline through collaborations and acquired in-process R&D arrangements, and return cash to shareholders while reducing debt. Risk mitigation mechanisms include establishing allowances for credit losses, managing rebate and chargeback accruals, revaluing contingent consideration liabilities at fair value to reflect updated probabilities, discount rates and projected sales, conducting annual or event-driven impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, performing actuarial adjustments for pension and post-employment benefit obligations, and defining contractual obligations and capital commitments to support ongoing debt service requirements. Through these measures, Abbvie demonstrates its capacity to maintain operational continuity, adapt resource deployment and preserve or improve functioning amid both nominal and exceptional external disturbances.

S&P Global’s MD&A describes a series of organizational responses and resource strategies consistent with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including a revised methodology for allocating centrally managed technology expenses to better reflect segment usage, continuous monitoring of the COVID-19 outbreak’s impact on all aspects of the business while acknowledging the uncertainty of its ultimate effect on operations and cash flows, and the reduction of travel and entertainment expenses through non-essential travel restrictions. The company emphasizes strong liquidity and capital resources—cash on hand, robust free cash flow, and a committed credit facility—sufficient to fund internal investments, disciplined acquisitions (such as the RobecoSAM ESG ratings business, Greenwich Associates LLC and Kensho), share repurchases, and capital expenditures that bolster foundational capabilities and support strategic priorities. Under its “Powering the Markets of the Future” framework, S&P Global seeks to enhance core businesses, pursue growth via adjacent markets, execute integration through an integration management office, and build team cohesion, trust and operational flexibility by standardizing technology, reimagining work environments, encouraging employee participation in reshaping how they work and serve, and advancing a risk culture through matured compliance and cybersecurity processes. Customer-first initiatives entail prioritizing customer preferences across multiple channels, pursuing partnerships to meet evolving needs, improving tools and processes for end-user productivity, and leveraging innovation teams and advanced technology to advance shared data processes and technical capabilities. The company also describes strategic portfolio reconfiguration through selective dispositions and alliances, the pursuit of ESG disclosures and sustainability targets, execution against regulatory milestones, and disciplined resource deployment—all of which support adaptability, risk mitigation, strategic foresight and the preservation or enhancement of performance under internal and external variations and disturbances.

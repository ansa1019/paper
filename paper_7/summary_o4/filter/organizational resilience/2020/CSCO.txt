Cisco’s management reported that in fiscal 2020 the company delivered growth in margins and earnings per share in a very challenging environment with the COVID-19 pandemic, continued to operate in a challenging macroeconomic and highly competitive environment and remained focused on accelerating innovation across its portfolio and executing strategic priorities to drive profitable growth over the long term. In response to the pandemic, the company prioritized supporting employees, customers, partners and communities by seamlessly transitioning most of its global workforce to remote work under a long-standing flexible work policy while ensuring the health and safety of on-site personnel, introduced free offers and trials for its Webex and security technologies to support rapid workforce digitization, committed significant funds to global and local pandemic response efforts, and launched a $2.5 billion business resiliency program offering up-front 90-day payment holidays with most payments deferred until calendar 2021 to enable business continuity for customers and partners. The company maintained strong liquidity and capital resources, with cash, cash equivalents and investments available for strategic investments, acquisitions, customer financing activities, working capital needs, stock repurchases and dividends, entered into a $2.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facility through May 2021, and managed supply chain flexibility and inventory obsolescence risk through purchase commitments and contract manufacturer agreements. It also engaged in secured securities lending with high-quality collateral, offered financing arrangements and guarantees to channel partners to facilitate working capital requirements while deferring revenue recognition, and initiated organizational realignment and cost savings of approximately $900 million through a voluntary early retirement program and other restructuring actions, expected to generate over $1 billion of annualized savings reinvested in key priority areas—all measures that support the organization’s ability to absorb external pressures, preserve performance under adversity, adapt resources to shifting conditions and maintain continuity of operations.

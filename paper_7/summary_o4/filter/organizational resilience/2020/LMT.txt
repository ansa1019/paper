We operate in an environment characterized by both complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures and have adopted a strategy to focus on program execution, improve the quality and predictability of delivery, and place security capabilities quickly into customers’ hands at affordable prices, recognizing that our customers are resource constrained and requiring disciplined portfolio development, innovation investments and people development to maintain organizational health and competitive strength. In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, which has presented unprecedented business challenges—including increased pandemic-related costs, supplier delivery delays, travel restrictions, site-access and quarantine requirements and remote-work adjustments—we have taken measures to protect the health and safety of our employees; worked with customers, suppliers and communities to minimize disruptions; proactively monitored and mitigated supply-chain risks; accelerated payments to impacted suppliers (prioritizing small businesses) by leveraging increased progress-payment rates; and implemented personal protective equipment programs, minimum-staffing and social-distancing policies, enhanced workspace sanitization, alternate work schedules and flexible teleworking policies to sustain production and services while managing the risks of transmission. Although staffing levels and supplier operations continue to fluctuate and the long-term impacts of prolonged remote work on operational continuity remain uncertain, our proactive actions—including temporary scheduling adjustments on key production programs, accelerated contract award timing, strong operational performance and lower overhead expenditures—have partially offset pandemic impacts on our financial results. We continue to work with the U.S. government to support essential infrastructure operations under varying local responses, assess potential second-source suppliers where fragility exists, and develop mitigation alternatives to preserve functioning and recover from internal and external disturbances, thereby maintaining integrity and performance under exceptional conditions.

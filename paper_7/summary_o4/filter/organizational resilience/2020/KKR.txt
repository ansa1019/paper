In the face of economic disruptions, most notably the COVID-19 pandemic that continues to cause business interruptions and volatility, the firm underscores the maintenance of positive adjustment by monitoring global and regional economic conditions, diversifying its investment strategies across private equity, core, growth and impact funds, real assets, infrastructure and alternative credit vehicles, and expanding into new strategies and investor segments to ensure operational flexibility and resource reallocation. It manages liquidity and capital through committed credit facilities, debt issuances, repurchase agreements, cash-flow matching and near-term commodity price hedges to mitigate the impact of adverse commodity price movements and capital-markets dislocations, thereby preserving financial flexibility and operational continuity under internal or external variations. The organization consolidates investment entities to maintain system integrity and oversight, employs a multi‐level valuation process—combining market comparables and discounted cash flow analyses with independent review—and incorporates dynamic adjustments such as carry reversals and clawback provisions to absorb strain and correct for negative returns. By aligning dividend policy, capital allocation-based income recognition, non-GAAP performance measures and capital-commitment frameworks with its underlying cash flows and strategic objectives, it ensures ongoing risk assessment, resource deployment and adaptability under challenging conditions, reinforcing its ability to absorb external pressures, reconfigure trajectories and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

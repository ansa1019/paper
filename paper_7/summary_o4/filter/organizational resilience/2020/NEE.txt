NEE and its subsidiaries have implemented a range of financial and operational mechanisms to preserve system integrity and maintain continuity under adverse and unexpected conditions, consistent with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. FPL’s service area was impacted by hurricanes Dorian, Isaias and Tropical Storm Eta, and storm restoration costs were absorbed through available reserve amortization and storm reserves in lieu of customer surcharges, thereby ensuring uninterrupted service and rapid recovery. Management continues to direct substantial investments in plant in service and other property—growing FPL’s retail rate base by approximately $3.9 billion in 2020 and adding 2,299 MW of new wind, 1,412 MW of wind repowering and 625 MW of solar capacity at NEER—to enhance operational flexibility and support evolving customer needs. NEE maintains approximately $10.9 billion of net available liquidity as of December 31, 2020, through cash flows from operations, committed revolving credit facilities and capital markets access, ensuring resiliency to funding constraints and market disruptions. The company employs derivative instruments across fuel, energy, interest rate and foreign currency portfolios to mitigate market volatility, and adjusts non-qualifying hedge impacts in its non-GAAP adjusted earnings measure to present a clearer view of underlying performance. NEE and FPL are closely monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and have taken steps to mitigate potential risks to operations. Regulatory-approved accrual and funding of nuclear decommissioning obligations, periodic impairment assessments of long-lived assets and equity investments based on projected cash flows and fair value techniques, and maintenance of investment grade credit ratings with specified debt-to-capitalization covenants collectively support the organization’s ability to absorb strain, adapt to environmental perturbations and preserve performance under both nominal and extreme conditions.

PepsiCo’s response to the once-in-a-generation Covid-19 crisis demonstrates the firm’s ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite extreme adversity: it protected the health of associates to maintain operations, secured its supply chain, ensured continuity in manufacturing, distribution and sales, strengthened e-commerce and digital capabilities, reimagined marketing and delivered positive outcomes for people, shareholders and the planet.  These actions were accompanied by targeted resource allocation to sustain or improve growth in high-return businesses, accelerated investments in manufacturing capacity, go-to-market systems and digital initiatives, and the deployment of a highly agile and flexible end-to-end value chain.  The Company renewed its focus on holistic cost management, precision revenue management and data analytics to enhance consumer insights, expanded global business services to enable better support at lower cost, diversified its workforce and reinforced a culture in which employees act like owners to drive rapid decision-making.  To manage the ongoing environmental turbulence and external pressures, PepsiCo implemented health and safety protocols, business continuity plans and crisis management protocols; it monitors economic, operating and political conditions in more than 200 markets; and it leverages an integrated risk management framework—including board oversight, a PepsiCo Risk Committee, Division and Country Risk Committees, a Risk Management Office, internal audit and compliance functions—to identify, assess, prioritize and address strategic, financial, operating, compliance, safety and reputational risks.  Further, the Company employs productivity initiatives and hedging strategies to mitigate volatility in commodity prices, foreign exchange and interest rates, maintains liquidity through cash from operations, revolving credit facilities and capital market access, and commits to supporting agricultural resiliency and sustainable practices, all in service of maintaining system integrity, operational continuity and long-term competitive advantage under challenging and rapidly changing conditions.

In fiscal 2020, the company’s operational continuity was tested by the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused temporary closures of company-operated and licensed stores, modified business operations and reduced customer traffic, prompting rapid deployment of health and welfare measures for partners—such as catastrophe pay, enhanced pay programs and benefit provisions—and a subsequent phased reopening that yielded sequential improvements in comparable store sales across Americas and International segments, thereby reflecting the resilience of the business model and brand strength. Concurrently, the company initiated strategic portfolio optimization in North America by blending store formats to address evolving customer tastes and preferences, which involved closing approximately 100 stores in the U.S. and Canada during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and planning for an additional 700 closures within 18 months, with related restructuring and impairment costs recorded in line with anticipated closure timelines. To support licensees’ recovery, the company extended more flexible development and financial terms—including waiving royalty payments—and invested in technologies and innovations to elevate customer and partner experiences, reimagining store formats and expanding contactless services, digital capabilities and beverage innovation to adapt to shifting consumer behaviors. From a financial resilience standpoint, the company strengthened liquidity through the issuance of short- and long-term debt, maintenance of revolving credit facilities and the suspension of share repurchases, managed its cash and highly liquid investment portfolio to fund operations, capital expenditures and shareholder returns, and deployed hedging instruments—including commodity, foreign currency and interest rate swaps—to mitigate the impact of market volatilities. Despite a significant revenue decline of 11% and operating margin contraction, the company’s systematic utilization of resource allocation, operational flexibility, risk mitigation mechanisms and strategic initiatives supported partial maintenance of performance under challenging external disturbances and positioned the organization to regain positive business momentum absent material relapses of the pandemic or global economic disruptions.

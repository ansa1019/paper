Bristol-Myers Squibb has responded to significant disruptions in global healthcare and economic environments by actively monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions, reinforcing workforce safety directives, implementing mandatory work-from-home policies, restricting travel and in-person meetings, adapting field-based personnel engagement through a remote model to maintain patient care and access to medicines, and ensuring that internal manufacturing facilities and key contract manufacturers operate with proper safety measures and without supply interruptions despite raw material scarcity. The company paused and safely recommenced clinical development activities—carefully restarting new and ongoing studies after feasibility assessments, rigorous planning and selected protocol simplifications—and continues to closely monitor patient enrollment, regulatory compliance and scientific integrity of trial data to preserve performance under challenging conditions. It evaluates economic and market factors such as financial market volatility, foreign currency fluctuations, interest rate changes, healthcare reform initiatives, pricing pressures, the creditworthiness of customers and the impacts of Brexit, and believes these external pressures will not have a material effect on its liquidity, cash flows or financial flexibility. Through the integrations of Celgene and MyoKardia, including restructuring activities and evolving its operating model to focus commercial, research and development and manufacturing resources on prioritized portfolios, strengthen R&D capabilities in tumor biology and biomarkers, streamline administrative functions and manufacturing networks, and realize $3.0 billion of cost synergies through 2022, the company is reallocating resources, reconfiguring its infrastructure and enhancing strategic and operational flexibility to absorb strain, preserve integrity and maintain performance in the face of adversity.

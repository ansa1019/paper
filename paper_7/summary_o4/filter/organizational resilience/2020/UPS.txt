During 2020, UPS implemented a “customer first, people led, innovation driven” strategy to transform nearly every aspect of its business, enhancing capabilities—speed, ease of access, digital access deployment and U.S. ground network upgrades—to maintain service continuity despite unexpected business shutdowns and government restrictions resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic; it adapted to a significant mix shift from business-to-business to business-to-consumer shipping, captured increased market rates and demand after a reduction in global air cargo capacity, and reconfigured its portfolio through the definitive agreement to divest UPS Freight in order to concentrate resources on core high-value businesses and improve operating margin and return on invested capital. The company updated activity-based expense allocation methodologies to better reflect operational activities, applied pricing flexibility through net base rate increases, residential and demand surcharges and capacity surcharges on international lanes, and employed foreign currency hedging and non-GAAP performance measures for ongoing resource allocation, incentive compensation and trend analysis. Acknowledging continued uncertainty regarding the duration and severity of the pandemic and economic recovery, UPS believes it is well positioned for long-term growth, supported by $6.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, access to commercial paper programs and capital markets, the use of a voluntary supply chain finance program to improve working capital efficiency, disciplined pension and postretirement funding, strict self-insurance reserve practices, committed capital expenditure plans, suspension of share repurchases to conserve liquidity, and rigorous risk mitigation frameworks for fuel, currency, interest rate exposure and contingent liabilities—all of which underpin its ability to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning and emerge stronger under challenging conditions.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its “materially adverse impact” on consumer demand and partner operations, the company “has taken and are taking various actions to address the impact of the pandemic on our business,” raising $4.1 billion in debt and amending its revolving credit facility to bolster financial flexibility, participating in government aid programs, eliminating non-essential travel and events, significantly reducing marketing spend worldwide, implementing a company-wide hiring freeze and undertaking restructuring activities across all brands to optimize efficiency and achieve approximately $370 million in annualized personnel cost savings. It also “worked with travelers and our travel service provider partners to deal with reservation cancellations and other disruptions,” exemplified by booking.com’s commitment to free cancellation of certain non-refundable bookings and OpenTable’s waiver of fees for restaurants, increased its provision for expected credit losses on receivables and cash advances, and shifted resource allocation toward domestic and mobile travel bookings amid volatile cancellation rates and uncertainty about vaccine availability. Long before the crisis, the company pursued a systemic perspective on resilience by increasing collaboration, cooperation and interdependency among its six primary brands—sharing resources and technological innovations, co-developing new services and coordinating market activities—as part of a strategic “connected trip” initiative to integrate multiple elements of travel and enhance operational flexibility. Confronting intense competition, regulatory scrutiny, macroeconomic turbulence and rapid digital transformation, it employs risk-mitigation practices such as hedging foreign-currency exposures with derivative instruments, dynamically adjusting performance marketing spend based on expected cancellation rates and return-on-investment metrics, and closely monitoring seasonal and booking-window shifts—efforts designed to preserve system integrity and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions while adapting to external disturbances and sustaining firm performance.

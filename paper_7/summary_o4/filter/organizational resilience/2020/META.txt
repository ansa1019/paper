In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have focused on helping people stay connected, assisting the public health response, and working on the economic recovery, while continuing to invest in our business based on our company priorities to address major social issues, build new experiences, support the millions of businesses that rely on our services, and communicate more transparently about our role in the world. We experienced significant increases in active user growth and engagement across multiple regions, followed by a return to pre-pandemic trends subject to ongoing volatility, and we expect future advertising revenue growth to depend on shifts in commerce from offline to online, consumer demand for products versus services, the economic recovery, and regulatory changes affecting ad targeting and measurement. We intend to continue to invest in our data center capacity, servers, network infrastructure, and office facilities, as well as scale our headcount to support growth, and anticipate capital expenditures of $21–23 billion and total expenses of $68–73 billion in 2021. We identify and manage risks through forward-looking statements and risk factor disclosures, collectibility assessments under Topic 606 that consider probability of default, customer financial strength, geography, and industry sub-vertical risks, and expected credit loss modeling under Topic 326 which incorporates past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. We evaluate legal, regulatory, tax, and other contingencies on a regular basis, accruing a liability when probable and reasonably estimable, and review goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or upon trigger events. Our principal sources of liquidity—cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations of $38.7 billion in 2020—have funded $15.7 billion of capital expenditures, $6.4 billion of equity investments, $6.3 billion of share repurchases, and $3.6 billion of taxes paid related to equity awards, and we currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs and fund our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements likely to have a material current or future effect, maintain operating lease commitments for offices, data centers, and equipment, and have entered into multi-year renewable energy agreements to secure volume and price, thereby preserving organizational integrity and performance under challenging conditions.

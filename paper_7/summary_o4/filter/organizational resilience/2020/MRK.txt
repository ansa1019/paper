Merck continued executing its strategic priorities, reporting year-over-year sales growth despite the business challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating operational flexibility and positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Roughly two-thirds of Merck’s pharmaceutical segment revenue is derived from physician-administered products, sales of which were negatively affected in 2020 by patients’ inability to access health-care providers, fewer well visits and social-distancing measures; however, in the latter part of the year the company experienced a partial recovery in underlying demand across its key growth pillars, reflecting adaptive reconfiguration of commercial operations. Despite pandemic-induced disruptions, employees across the organization enrolled and maintained clinical studies, progressed the pipeline and ensured the supply of and patient access to the company’s portfolio of medically important medicines and vaccines, illustrating business continuity, resourcefulness and resilience in the face of external pressures. In response to the pandemic, Merck remained focused on protecting the safety of its employees, ensuring that its supply of medicines and vaccines reaches its patients, contributing its scientific expertise to the development of antiviral approaches and supporting health-care providers and Merck’s communities, embodying emergency management and crisis response capacities. The company actively monitors the business development landscape for growth opportunities that meet its strategic criteria, allocating resources to expand its oncology presence through acquisitions and strategic collaborations, and plans to invest more than $20 billion in new capital projects from 2020 to 2024 to increase manufacturing capacity for its key products, demonstrating long-term orientation, resource deployment and adaptability to environmental turbulence. Additionally, Merck remains on track to complete the spin-off of Organon in the second quarter of 2021, creating two companies each focused on their strengths and portfolios to pursue respective market opportunities and business strategies, reflecting a systemic perspective and strategic agility in organizational change processes. Merck’s global restructuring program, which is expected to generate approximately $900 million in annual net cost savings by the end of 2023 through optimization of its manufacturing and supply network and reduction of its global real estate footprint, further illustrates proactive measures and operational efficiency that reinforce organizational resilience.

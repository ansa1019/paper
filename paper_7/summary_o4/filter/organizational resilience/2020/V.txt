Visa Inc. reports that, in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, it has actively monitored the outbreak, prioritized the safety of employees, clients and communities, implemented remote working arrangements for most staff, scaled back hiring, restricted travel, lowered marketing spend and reduced use of external resources, while maintaining close and regular contact with stakeholders to navigate these challenging times and continuously evaluating the nature and extent of the impact on its operations. To mitigate financial and operational risks and preserve system integrity under external disturbances, the company employs a hedging program to offset foreign exchange volatility, maintains treasury policies designed to ensure adequate liquidity for operating expenditures, contingency scenarios, settlement obligations and planned capital investments, and invests excess cash in U.S. Treasury and government-sponsored agency debt securities. Visa also maintains a $5.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and a $3.0 billion commercial paper program to support working capital requirements and general corporate purposes, has issued fixed-rate senior notes totaling $7.3 billion with maturities between 7 and 30 years, and holds approximately $7.7 billion of available liquidity globally to fund daily payment settlement in the event clients are unable to settle. Under its U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the company funds a litigation escrow account to insulate shareholders from monetary liabilities arising from specified litigation, indemnifies financial institution clients for settlement losses backed by global settlement risk policies and collateral requirements, and believes that cash flow from operations, its investment portfolio and access to committed credit arrangements will be sufficient to meet its projected liquidity needs for more than the next twelve months.

In 2020, Comcast materially adapted its operations to preserve functioning under exceptional conditions by securing additional liquidity through the issuance of $18.6 billion of long-term debt to repay existing indebtedness and maintain $11.7 billion of cash on hand; by managing cash conservatively through reductions in costs and capital expenditures; by maintaining significant availability under its revolving credit facilities and commercial paper programs to meet short-term liquidity requirements; and by continually evaluating the impacts of COVID-19 on its businesses to assess potential impairment charges. The company absorbed strain on its distribution network as it performed well under the stress of increased traffic and peak usage driven by remote work and learning; incurred costs to keep customers connected—compensating frontline personnel, waiving certain fees, forgoing disconnections for nonpayment and providing flexible payment options for internet services; and adapted its service offerings, notably by launching Peacock, to respond to shifting consumer needs. Capital expenditures decreased 4.4% to $6.6 billion, reflecting lower spending on customer premise equipment and support capital, partially offset by increased investment in scalable infrastructure and network capacity, while construction of certain theme-park projects was deferred to balance resource deployment with market uncertainty. The company also implemented cost-savings initiatives, including targeted severance programs, to refine its operating cost base; preserved business continuity in its theme parks and entertainment segments through staggered reopenings, contractual adjustment provisions for professional sports and revised distribution strategies; and maintained dividend increases to support stakeholder confidence. Throughout these actions, Comcast demonstrated a multifaceted resilience approach—anticipating future conditions, mitigating risks, reconfiguring resources, and preserving integrity and performance despite the unprecedented external shocks of the pandemic.

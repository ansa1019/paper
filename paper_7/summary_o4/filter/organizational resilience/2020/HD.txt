In fiscal 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic the company demonstrated maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions—absorbing strain and preserving or improving functioning—by adapting its operations and resource deployment, including changing store operating hours, limiting customer counts, rolling out curbside pickup, transitioning store support operations to remote or virtual platforms, and adopting a localized approach to store-level demand management while expanding hours and mandating masks for associates and customers. Cross-functional collaboration and strategic investments in interconnected and digital assets, supply chain capabilities, associates, and the merchandising organization enabled real-time adjustments to product assortments, the introduction of alternative products, and prioritization of high-demand categories to mitigate supply chain disruptions and sustain performance under external pressures. The acquisition and integration of HD Supply was positioned to accelerate sales growth by better serving MRO customers, illustrating the reconfiguration of resources and capabilities to emerge stronger from a disruptive event. Financial resilience was bolstered through an elevated cash position, expanded commercial paper and credit facilities, issuances and repayments of long-term debt, disciplined capital allocation and the deferral and prioritization of strategic in-store investments, while temporary and subsequent permanent enhancements to associate pay and benefits underscored the company’s commitment to human capital resilience. These combined actions reflect the company’s operational flexibility, risk mitigation, strategic response and systemic perspective essential for sustaining organizational integrity and performance in a turbulent environment.

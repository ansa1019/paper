In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company focused on maintaining business continuity, supporting employees, customers and communities, and preparing for the long-term success of its operations, releasing four emergency response applications—including management and safe workplace suites—to help customers navigate the return to the workplace and support health and safety, canceling its in-person annual knowledge user conference in favor of a digital event experience, temporarily closing most offices and encouraging remote work, and implementing operational changes that have not affected—and are not expected to affect—its ability to maintain operations, including financial reporting systems, internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. The company’s subscription-based business model yields relatively predictable revenues, billings and earnings, and it continues to invest in the development of its services, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth; it allocates resources to expand data center capacity, enhance infrastructure hardware and software, and deploy strategic advisory, implementation and consulting services to accelerate platform adoption and drive customer outcomes. The discussion acknowledges that the ongoing uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic—such as potential curtailment of customer demand, reduced spend or contract duration, delayed collections, lengthened payment terms or sales cycles, competition on pricing and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations—could cause variability in results, yet the company’s data-driven monitoring of these effects, its systemic perspective on remaining performance obligations and contract renewals, and its operational flexibility to adjust staffing, marketing events and service delivery demonstrate its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adverse conditions.

In our management’s discussion and analysis, we describe a company-wide transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smoke-free future by replacing cigarettes with smoke-free products, leveraging multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation to meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements; to support this transformation and provide operational flexibility, effective January 1, 2018, we reorganized into six reportable segments to focus resources on both combustible and reduced-risk products; we note that our net revenues and operating income are affected by external pressures such as product volume and mix, pricing variances across markets, currency exchange fluctuations and geographic mix, prompting ongoing adjustments in pricing strategy and market focus to mitigate adverse impacts; we optimize our capital structure—such as using existing cash to repay the $2.5 billion principal of our matured ten-year U.S. bond—and manage cost of sales components including tobacco leaf, raw materials, labor, manufacturing, shipping and warranty provisions, while our marketing, administration and research expenditures reflect targeted investments in new product development and innovation; our adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, retrospectively to all prior periods and our comprehensive analysis and adjustment of provisional estimates under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act demonstrate our capacity to absorb regulatory changes and maintain financial performance; finally, as a holding company whose principal sources of funds are dividends and debt repayments from subsidiaries that are not subject to restrictive long-term debt covenants, we preserve business continuity and resource accessibility to support resilience under challenging conditions.

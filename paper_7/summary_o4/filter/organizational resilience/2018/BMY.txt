Cost savings resulting from our transformation initiatives continue to be redeployed in R&D and other areas of higher priorities and, through our operating model transformation, our commercial infrastructure is uniquely leveraged for potential growth as we focus commercial, R&D and manufacturing resources on prioritized brands and markets, strengthen our R&D capabilities in tumor biology, patient selection and new biomarkers, streamline administrative functions and manufacturing networks to reflect portfolio priorities and maintain a disciplined approach in marketing, selling and administrative expenses that delivers the strategic, financial and operational flexibility necessary to invest in the highest-priority opportunities. We continuously evaluate our capital structure to ensure efficient financing, which may include the repurchase of common stock and debt securities, termination of interest rate swap contracts prior to maturity and the issuance of debt securities, and have entered into bridge commitment facilities and forward-starting interest rate swap option contracts to hedge future interest rate risk associated with anticipated long-term debt issuances. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with cash generated from operations and the issuance of commercial paper, will satisfy normal cash requirements for at least the next few years, including dividends, capital expenditures, milestone payments, working capital, the deemed repatriation transition tax and debt maturities. Acquisitions, divestitures, licensing and collaboration arrangements allow us to focus resources on growth opportunities that drive the greatest long-term value and foster inter-organizational collaboration, and our investment policy establishes limits on investment amounts and maturities to manage risk. We have established a company-wide policy and governance processes to monitor and limit sales to direct customers in accordance with the SEC consent order, escalated review of potential compliance concerns and regular monitoring of inventory levels, thereby mitigating risk, preserving operational continuity and enhancing our capacity to maintain functionality and performance under external variations and disruptions. Looking ahead, we will continue to implement our biopharma strategy by driving growth of prioritized brands, executing product launches, investing in our diverse and innovative pipeline, focusing on priority markets, increasing investments in manufacturing capabilities and maintaining a culture of continuous improvement to adapt to environmental disruptions and sustain organizational performance.

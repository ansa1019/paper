The discussion acknowledges that our results may differ materially from forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties, including macro-economic conditions, political events, regulatory changes, technological developments, consumer behavior shifts and competitive pressures that can unpredictably impair travel demand and alter operating performance. We recognize the need to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under these adversities by investing in marketing, technology, personnel and new service offerings such as expanded accommodations, alternative payment options and merchant transactions to enhance operational flexibility, resource deployment and service innovation. We adapt our reporting and resource management practices―for example, evaluating constant-currency metrics, employing derivatives and euro-denominated debt as hedges, and maintaining a $2 billion revolving credit facility―to mitigate currency and liquidity risks, support business continuity and sustain long-term growth even under internal or external disturbances. We also pursue strategic initiatives including brand and performance marketing, selective acquisitions, share repurchases and capital expenditures for data-center capacity and international expansion, balancing growth priorities with margin pressures. In response to legal and tax contingencies, such as the French tax assessments and U.S. transition tax under the Tax Act, we have made precautionary payments to preserve contestation rights and recorded provisions to manage our exposure, demonstrating resilience through crisis management and risk mitigation measures.

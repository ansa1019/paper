The disclosures describe an organization that operates amid complex global security and economic pressures by focusing on disciplined program execution, improving the quality and predictability of its products and services, and placing security capability quickly in the hands of resource-constrained customers at affordable prices, thereby enabling positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Portfolio shaping activities through independent research and development, selective acquisitions, divestitures and internal realignments are pursued to strengthen core capabilities, access new technologies and reconfigure the enterprise in adjacent markets, supporting continuity and adaptability. The company invests in technology innovation, sustainment services, cybersecurity, and human capital—ensuring the technical skills necessary to respond effectively to evolving mission requirements—while also returning cash to investors. Risk management practices include identifying and monitoring technical, schedule and cost risks on long-term contracts, employing percentage-of-completion accounting and profit booking-rate adjustments (risk retirements or loss provisions) to reflect improved or deteriorated conditions, recognizing contract losses when estimated costs exceed transaction price, and maintaining reserves for performance matters on key programs. Financial resilience is maintained through stringent environmental remediation monitoring under FAR regulations, recording receivables for costs probable of recovery, managing offset agreements within contract cost estimates, deploying foreign currency and interest rate hedges to mitigate earnings and cash flow volatility, and actively managing liquidity via strong operating cash flows, a balanced cash deployment strategy of capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, debt refinancing and a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility to ensure operational continuity amid budget uncertainty and government funding risks. To stabilize postretirement benefit costs and reduce volatility, defined benefit pension plans for non-union employees have been frozen, substantial pension contributions were made, and buy-in and buy-out insurance contracts were executed to lock in obligations, with recoveries through contract pricing under CAS harmonization. Capital investments in equipment, facilities infrastructure and information technology support higher production volumes, modernization and operational flexibility. The company’s ongoing sustainment volume for major defense and space programs, disciplined cost recovery, and strategic initiatives collectively support its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite external disturbances and adversity.

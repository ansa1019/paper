Our fiscal 2018 results reflect the impact of certain restructuring and streamlining efforts, beginning in Q4 2017, designed to accelerate growth in high-return businesses and remove non-core, slow-growth activities; these efforts included the acquisition and consolidation of our East China joint venture, the conversion of Singapore, Taiwan and Brazil operations to licensed models, the sale of our Tazo brand, the closure of certain company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada, and the licensing of our CPG and foodservice businesses to Nestlé, and spanned all segments and corporate functions. Concurrent with those actions, we realigned our organizational and operating segment structures in support of the newly established global coffee alliance and revised the classification of certain costs to better align expenses with revenue-generating activities. Starbucks’ 2018 performance continued to demonstrate the strength of our global business model and our ability to make disciplined investments in our business and our partners, as evidenced by 10 percent revenue growth, improved operating cash flow driven by the upfront payment from Nestlé, and targeted capital expenditures of $2.0 billion primarily for new and existing store investments and strategic store-related initiatives. Looking forward to fiscal 2019, we expect moderate revenue growth reflecting implementation of our streamlining activities and comparable store sales growth, a slight decline in operating margin, continued capital deployment of approximately $2.0 billion, and disciplined long-term investments to accelerate growth in the U.S. and China, expand the global reach of our brand, and increase shareholder returns. We actively manage our cash, investments and borrowing capacity—through a $2 billion five-year revolving credit facility, a $1 billion 364-day credit facility, a $3 billion commercial paper program and periodic long-term debt issuances in compliance with covenants—to ensure liquidity for working capital, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividend payments and unforeseen contingencies. We employ market-risk management policies and hedging transactions to mitigate commodity price volatility, foreign currency fluctuations, equity-price exposure and interest-rate risk, and we maintain investment portfolios of high-quality, liquid securities to support business continuity. Our critical accounting policies for property, plant and equipment, goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and income taxes provide for regular assessment of impairment and tax positions, ensuring the integrity of reported results under varying economic conditions and reinforcing our capacity to preserve or improve functioning despite internal or external variations and disturbances.

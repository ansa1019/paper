Cost reductions resulting from our process improvement programs and restructuring programs were the primary factors contributing to the increase in our gross profit margin for 2018, partially offset by negative impacts from foreign currency fluctuations, and our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to leverage from increased sales and targeted initiatives such as end-to-end business process streamlining and automation, including functional expansion of global shared service and robotic process utilization. We have increased our investment in infrastructure in emerging markets in order to maximize opportunities, and we invest excess cash on hand in short-term financial instruments that earn at market interest rates while mitigating principal risk through instrument and counterparty diversification, limiting our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer. Based on our current business plan, we believe our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents, future cash generated from operations, access to capital markets and existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations, invest in our infrastructure, pay our legal-related liabilities, pay taxes due, fund possible mergers and acquisitions and service and repay our existing debt, supporting operational continuity under internal or external variations and disturbances. In November 2018, the board approved a new global restructuring program expected to result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $200 million to $300 million and reduce gross annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately $100 million to $150 million by the end of 2022, with a substantial portion of the savings reinvested in strategic growth initiatives. We continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine amounts that may be paid as a result of such claims and litigation, which could materially adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and/or ability to comply with debt covenants, and our liquidity plans remain subject to macroeconomic conditions, adverse litigation outcomes and other risks and uncertainties outside our control. Our critical accounting policies for revenue recognition, inventory provisions, valuation of intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilities, goodwill impairment testing, legal and product liability accruals and income taxes reflect our systemic perspective on risk assessment, resource allocation and preservation of performance, and our adoption of ASC Topic 606 and COSOâ€™s 2013 framework underscores our commitment to maintaining the integrity of financial reporting systems, which we believe is effective as of December 31, 2018 based on our assessment.

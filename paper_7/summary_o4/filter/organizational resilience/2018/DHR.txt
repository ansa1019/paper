Consistent with organizational resilience conceived as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” and the ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite internal or external disturbances, Danaher’s geographic and industry diversity, along with its broad array of products, software and services, helps limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results. Operating in highly competitive, regulated and volatile global markets, the company’s long-term growth and profitability depend on its ability to expand in high-growth geographies, identify, consummate and integrate acquisitions, reconfigure organizational structures through separations such as Fortive and the planned dental spin-off, and drive innovation with differentiated new products and services—exemplifying dynamic capabilities, system resilience and a systemic perspective. Significant investments, both organic and through acquisitions, to globalize manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources, particularly in high-growth markets, demonstrate proactive adaptation to rapid technological development, environmental perturbations and shifting customer needs. The ongoing application of the Danaher Business System has yielded incremental year-over-year cost savings, improved productivity, operating efficiency and quality, and enhanced operational flexibility—all mechanisms for risk mitigation and resilience strategies. The company monitors and manages exposures to external disturbances, including Brexit-related uncertainty, foreign currency translation risk, interest rate fluctuations and commodity price volatility, through normal operating and financing activities, cross-currency swap contracts and a diversified debt portfolio, thereby preserving system integrity and business continuity. Strong operating cash flows, supplemented by committed credit facilities and commercial paper programs, support resource generation and deployment for capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends and debt service, ensuring the firm’s capacity to reconstitute resources, maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

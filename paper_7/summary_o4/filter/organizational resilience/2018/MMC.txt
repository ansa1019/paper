In its risk and insurance services segment, the company offers risk advice, risk transfer and risk control and mitigation solutions to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite internal and external pressures, and has initiated a program to simplify the organization through reduced management layers and more common structures across regions and businesses to more closely align with its segmentation strategy, thereby increasing efficiencies and additional capacity for reinvestment in people and technology. To manage financial volatility and safeguard business continuity, the company entered into a deal contingent foreign exchange contract to hedge GBP-denominated acquisition costs and treasury lock contracts to hedge interest rate risk prior to senior note issuances, established a $1.5 billion commercial paper program, expanded its $1.5 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility to $1.8 billion and issued bridge loans and senior notes aggregating over $5 billion. In response to evolving regulatory and demographic conditions, defined benefit pension plans in Canada and the U.S. were amended to discontinue further benefit accruals in favor of defined contribution arrangements, and post-retirement benefits were modified to better match future obligations, while ongoing case-level reviews by inside and outside counsel and internal actuarial analysis support the estimation and adjustment of errors and omissions liabilities on a quarterly basis. The company also capitalizes certain incremental costs to obtain and fulfill contracts and amortizes them over the expected life of customer relationships under the new revenue recognition standard, repatriates non-U.S. earnings in light of U.S. tax reform and targets contributions to maintain funded status in its defined benefit plans. These measures collectively reflect the firmâ€™s dynamic capabilities, operational flexibility and resource reconfiguration to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations.

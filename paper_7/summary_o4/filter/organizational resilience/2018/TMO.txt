The company expands its product lines and services by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses, augmenting internal growth with acquisitions financed through debt and equity, and deploying cash and borrowing capacity to meet requirements for at least the next 24 months while leaving undrawn revolver capacity equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to ensure continuity if markets are unavailable. Strategic growth investments include targeted spending to enhance commercial capabilities—expanding geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, service and operational infrastructure, focused research projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience—while productivity improvements arise from the practical process improvement business system, global sourcing initiatives, headcount reductions, facility consolidations and low-cost region manufacturing. Restructuring and other actions—severance, facility abandonments and integration costs—have been recorded to streamline operations and are expected to yield annual cost savings, with further measures identified for 2019 once specified criteria are met. Approximately half of cash balances and cash flows are sourced outside the U.S., deployed for acquisitions and intercompany debt repayments, and repatriated through non-taxable returns of capital and dividend planning to mitigate tax exposure and preserve liquidity. Investing activities are guided by projected returns on acquisitions and capital expenditures of $800-$850 million for property, plant and equipment, while financing activities manage maturities of senior notes, commercial paper obligations, share repurchases and dividend programs to optimize capital structure. Management’s critical accounting policies and estimates—based on historical experience, current market and economic conditions, peer trading multiples and weighted average cost of capital assumptions—support fair-value determinations, annual and interim impairment evaluations triggered by unexpected adverse conditions, and assessments of income tax positions, all to maintain the integrity and performance of assets under internal or external variations and disturbances. Accruals for legal, environmental and other contingencies are established using judgments about probability of loss and experience, and off-balance-sheet arrangements—letters of credit, guarantees and indemnities—are maintained to cover performance risks, none of which management believes will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Together, these measures reflect the company’s multifaceted capacity to absorb strain, adapt to environmental disruptions and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions.

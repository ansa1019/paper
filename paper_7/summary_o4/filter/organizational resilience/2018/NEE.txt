In managing the impacts of Hurricane Irma, FPL employed reserve amortization to offset nearly all storm restoration costs and plans to partially restore the reserve through tax savings under the 2016 rate agreement, thereby preserving operational continuity despite extreme weather conditions. NEE’s adjusted earnings framework, which excludes volatility from non-qualifying hedges and certain nonrecurring items, reflects a strategic choice to maintain positive adjustment under challenging market conditions and enhances comparability of operating performance. The deconsolidation of NEP in January 2018 delivered a gain of approximately $3.9 billion, evidencing strategic reconfiguration of corporate holdings to bolster NEE’s capital structure. NEE and its subsidiaries allocate resources for growth and risk mitigation through diversified funding sources—including cash flows from operations, short- and long-term borrowings, equity issuances and asset sales—and maintain robust liquidity supported by revolving credit facilities and investment-grade credit ratings to ensure business continuity and absorb financial strain. Through established risk management policies and derivative instruments, including value-at-risk analysis for commodity positions and collateral arrangements, NEE manages market, interest-rate and counterparty credit risks to sustain system integrity and performance under environmental and economic perturbations. Strategic investments in plant in service and incremental renewable generation capacity, coupled with regulatory mechanisms such as base-rate and cost-recovery clause adjustments, further demonstrate NEE’s systemic perspective and adaptability in aligning resource deployment and operational flexibility with evolving customer needs and regulatory frameworks.

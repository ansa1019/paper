In fiscal 2018, the company undertook a comprehensive strategic reassessment of the business, installed a new leadership team and developed action plans to improve performance under challenging conditions by sharpening its focus on retail fundamentals, aligning decision-making and execution, rationalizing store inventory to eliminate lower-performing SKUs, and investing in top-selling items for its pro customers; during the year it committed to exit Orchard Supply Hardware operations, close under-performing stores in the U.S. and Canada, exit non-core activities such as Alacrity Renovation Services and Iris Smart Home, pursue the exit of Mexican retail operations, eliminate the Project Specialists Interiors position, and change its accounting treatment of shipping and handling costs, collectively resulting in $1.1 billion of pre-tax charges and a $952 million goodwill impairment in Canada in response to a softened housing market; as it transitioned into 2019, Lowe’s defined four key resilience-oriented focus areas—driving merchandising excellence through improved productivity, localization and digital experiences; transforming its supply chain to enhance fulfillment and delivery capabilities; delivering operational efficiency via simplified store operations and better in-stock execution; and intensifying customer engagement by winning the pro customer with competitive pricing and differentiated service—while deploying $1.2 billion of capital expenditures, generating $6.2 billion of operating cash flow, maintaining $1.98 billion of committed credit facilities, and managing self-insurance reserves, lease obligations and non-GAAP measures such as return on invested capital and adjusted diluted earnings per share, all of which reflect the organization’s capability to absorb strain, reconfigure resources and preserve or improve functioning under external pressures.

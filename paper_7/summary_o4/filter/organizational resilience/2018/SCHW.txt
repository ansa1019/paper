The report discloses a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework, approved by the board, that incorporates the firm’s purpose, vision and values to set the tone for a resilient corporate culture and defines risk appetite for pursuit of strategy, with senior management and a global risk committee overseeing policies and procedures across business and control units to identify, measure, monitor and mitigate operational, credit, market, liquidity and compliance risks. It describes regular liquidity and capital stress testing under both business-as-usual and stressed conditions and contingency funding and capital plans to ensure ongoing access to diversified funding sources and maintenance of regulatory ratios, as well as net interest revenue simulation modeling to manage interest rate sensitivity by aligning the duration and repricing profiles of interest-earning assets and funding liabilities. The firm maintains backup and recovery infrastructure, geographically dispersed workforces, routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans, and a formal incident management program to ensure operational continuity in the event of natural disasters, technological failures, cyber attacks or other external shocks. An information security program employs layered controls, advanced monitoring, restricted data access, employee training and collaboration with law enforcement and industry peers to detect and deter unauthorized access and protect client and company information. Third-party risk is managed through contractual provisions, control standards, ongoing performance monitoring and regular testing, while model risk is governed via a centralized registration process, risk-rating of models, and oversight of development and use. Compliance and fiduciary risks are addressed through policies, procedures and supervisory controls designed to uphold legal and regulatory obligations. The firm also invests in technology projects, campus expansion and talent acquisition, allocates capital for strategic growth while maintaining expense discipline, and issues clear forward-looking statements regarding its ability to adjust client deposit rates, manage the duration of sweep cash and trading assets, and reconfigure capital deployment to benefit from rising rates and limit exposure to falling rates—all efforts that support positive adjustment under challenging conditions and the preservation of organizational integrity and performance.

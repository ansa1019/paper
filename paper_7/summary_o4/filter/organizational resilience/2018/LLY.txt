The Company regularly reviews and adjusts its cost structure through asset impairments, restructuring charges, and the suspension of commercial activities for certain products, such as Posilac and Imrestor, to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adverse market, regulatory, and competitive pressures. It manages research and development spending across its portfolio and strategically invests in external collaborations and acquisitions—including Armo, Dicerna, and LOXO Oncology—to reconfigure resources, pursue innovation, and mitigate the high-risk nature of drug development. The suspension of promotion for Lartruvo and ongoing engagement with global regulators exemplify immediate reconfiguring of strategic trajectories in response to clinical setbacks. Financial resilience is maintained through a controlled risk-management program that balances fixed and floating debt, hedges interest rate and foreign currency exposures, and maintains significant unused credit facilities and liquidity to support business continuity. Dividend distributions for 133 consecutive years alongside share repurchase programs demonstrate commitment to organizational strength and stakeholder value. The Company monitors and adapts to evolving geopolitical, legislative, and economic dynamics—such as the Venezuelan financial crisis, healthcare policy reforms, and loss of patent exclusivity—and employs exchange offers, spin-offs of its Elanco Animal Health subsidiary, and proactive debt and equity transactions to ensure system integrity, operational continuity, and performance maintenance amid disruptive change.

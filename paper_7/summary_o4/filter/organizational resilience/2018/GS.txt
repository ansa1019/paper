Goldman Sachs describes an integrated suite of measures designed to support its ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including a formal business continuity plan, information-security program and comprehensive risk-management and liquidity policies; a resolution plan and strategy underpinned by resolution capital and liquidity models and a triggers-and-alerts framework; and the oversight of a global business resilience committee and firmwide asset-liability and contingency funding plans that pre-fund potential cash and collateral needs through a pool of unencumbered, high-quality liquid assets. The firm employs dynamic balance‐sheet planning—including scenario analyses, stress tests (short‐ and long-term, intraday and resolution-specific) and risk limits—to manage market, credit, liquidity and operational exposures; integrates capital planning and stress testing under CCAR and DFAST to project capital usage under severely adverse scenarios; and holds diversified deposit, secured and unsecured funding lines at both parent and subsidiary levels. Governance is provided by board oversight and a risk appetite statement and is operationalized through a network of firmwide committees covering new activities, conduct, technology risk, model risk, capital, commitments and operational risk, all supported by independent model-risk and operational-risk management functions that perform self-assessments, control validations and independent reviews. Together these measures reinforce organizational resilience through adaptability, resource allocation, operational continuity, crisis management and the capacity to maintain critical functions and stakeholder service through systemic disruptions, environmental perturbations and evolving regulatory requirements.

Cisco describes its resilience in terms of ongoing investments in evolving intent-based technologies that are constantly learning and adapting to provide customers with a highly secure, intelligent platform for their digital business; by operating in a challenging and highly competitive environment while continuing to aggressively invest in priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term; through productivity improvements—including component redesign, value engineering, lower warranty expenses, and operational efficiencies—to mitigate adverse impacts from pricing pressure and constrained component supply; by initiating a restructuring plan in fiscal 2018 to realign the organization and enable further investment in key strategic initiatives; by maintaining a strong liquidity position—cash, cash equivalents, and a high-quality investment-grade fixed income portfolio—to support working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, customer financing programs, and returns to shareholders; by defining a capital allocation strategy that returns a minimum of 50% of free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases; by actively managing inventory and supply chain flexibility to ensure competitive lead times while controlling the risk of obsolescence; by employing rigorous risk assessment and allowance processes for receivables based on credit quality, economic conditions, and concentration risks; by offering financing guarantees and monitoring contingent liabilities; by disclosing forward-looking statements and risk factors to inform stakeholders of uncertainties and assumptions underpinning forecasts; and by articulating strategic priorities—accelerating innovation, increasing the value of the network, and transforming the business model—that reflect a systemic perspective, dynamic capabilities, and strategic agility to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under adverse and unexpected conditions.

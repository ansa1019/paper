The company’s resilience initiatives are evident in its continued focus on safety and risk mitigation, exemplified by programs such as “courage to care,” total safety culture and UP Way that leverage technology, risk assessment, training and employee engagement to reduce personal injury and derailment incidents and maintain operational integrity under adverse conditions. Confronted with network congestion and excessive equipment inventories, the railroad implemented its Unified Plan 2020 in late 2018—reconfiguring transportation plans, reducing variability in network operations, optimizing resource utilization by retiring 625 locomotives and cutting car inventory by over 10%, and improving terminal dwell times by 14% in the fourth quarter—to enhance service reliability and operational flexibility in the face of internal and external disturbances. Revenue management via fuel surcharge mechanisms further enables the company to absorb price shocks and sustain financial performance amid volatile fuel markets. A disciplined capital plan of approximately $3.2 billion, with 75–80% dedicated to renewing existing infrastructure and the balance to new capacity investments, supports long-term business continuity, network efficiency and future growth. To safeguard liquidity and business continuity, the company maintains a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, a receivables securitization program and diversified access to capital markets, enabling prompt responses to cash requirements and market fluctuations. These integrated actions—spanning safety culture, operational reconfiguration, strategic resource allocation, infrastructure renewal, revenue adaptability and proactive liquidity management—demonstrate the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under challenging and variable conditions.

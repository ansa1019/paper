Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities, managing our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis with essentially no centralized or integrated business functions and minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses, while our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the chief executive to head each of the operating businesses. Our long-held philosophy of acquiring securities and holding those securities for long periods leads us to consider investment gains and losses as non-operating, based on the belief that such gains and losses are not necessarily meaningful in understanding our operating results, even though they have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. In our insurance operations, the timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses, yet we engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property/casualty, life and health risks, assume defined portions of risk and adjust estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts for prior years’ events, to reflect changes in the timing and amount of future claim payments. Our railroad business generated a 31.8% increase in after-tax earnings in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting an increase in unit volume, higher average revenue per car/unit and a lower effective income tax rate, partly offset by increased fuel and other operating costs, demonstrating operational flexibility in response to changing volumes, rates and cost pressures. Our regulated utilities and energy businesses passed the benefits of lower income tax expense attributable to the TCJA to customers through various regulatory mechanisms, including lower rates, higher depreciation and reductions to rate base, which produced lower revenue and pre-tax earnings in 2018 but preserved system integrity and performance under new statutory conditions. Across our manufacturing, service and retailing operations, segment results reflect ongoing adjustments to income tax rates, raw material cost increases, product mix changes and competitive market pressures, as evidenced by a 7.2% increase in Lubrizol’s revenues despite significant raw material cost increases, a 20.7% increase in Clayton Homes’ home-sale revenues and a 33.7% increase in TTI’s electronic component distribution revenues, while margin management and expense control offset cost pressures. In highly competitive distribution environments such as McLane’s grocery and foodservice businesses, significant pricing pressures and evolving customer needs continue to challenge current operating results, underscoring the need for continual reassessment of liabilities, resource deployment and strategic responses to unexpected and adverse external conditions.

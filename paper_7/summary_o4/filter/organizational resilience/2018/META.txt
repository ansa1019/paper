The Company’s 2018 annual report highlights a series of strategic initiatives and resource allocations that support its ability to preserve or improve functioning under varying internal and external pressures. In its executive overview, the Company states that it “continued to invest, based on our roadmap, in … long-term technology initiatives, such as connectivity, artificial intelligence, and augmented and virtual reality,” and that it “intends to continue to invest based on this roadmap,” including “expanding our data center capacity, network infrastructure, and office facilities as well as scaling our headcount to support our growth, and … investments in safety and security, marketing, video content, and our long-term technology initiatives,” all of which underpin operational flexibility and continuity. To secure financial resilience, the Company maintains substantial cash and marketable securities, has established a $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, and implemented a multi-currency notional cash pool that provides overdraft credit, believing that “our available funds, credit facility, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future.” In addition, the Company enters into multi-year agreements to purchase network components to secure either volume or price commitments, and it routinely evaluates and adjusts its estimates, assumptions and provisions for loss contingencies, including legal proceedings and uncertain tax positions, to reflect evolving circumstances. These practices, together with continued share repurchases under board authorization and proactive tax planning following the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, demonstrate the Company’s ongoing efforts to allocate resources, mitigate risks, and maintain performance under challenging and changing conditions.

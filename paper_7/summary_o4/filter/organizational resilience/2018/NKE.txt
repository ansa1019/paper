In June 2017, we announced the consumer direct offense, a new company alignment designed to allow Nike to better serve the consumer personally, at scale, leveraging the power of digital to drive growth by accelerating innovation and product creation, moving even closer to the consumer through key cities and deepening one-to-one connections, and through this organizational realignment, beginning in fiscal 2018, we focused on our triple double strategy with the objective of doubling the impact of innovation, increasing our speed to market and growing our direct connections with consumers. While foreign currency markets remain volatile, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the long-term by executing against the operational strategies outlined above. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows; we manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to Nike, Inc., taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and, where practical and material, hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options, with a hedging policy designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged and without holding or issuing derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations and electing to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, and to minimize the impact of translating foreign currency-denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. dollar-denominated available-for-sale investments and utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of forecasted future purchases and sales of these investments, thereby partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures such as wholesale equivalent revenues and currency-neutral revenues when evaluating the companyâ€™s performance, including when making financial and operating decisions, and believes these measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. In the current marketplace environment, we believe there has been a meaningful shift in the way consumers shop for product and make purchasing decisions, with consumers demanding a constant flow of fresh and innovative product and expecting superior service and real-time delivery, all fueled by the shift toward digital; specifically, in North America we anticipate continued evolution within the retail landscape driven by shifting consumer traffic patterns across digital and physical channels, and although the evolution of the retail environment has resulted in third-party retail store closures, we are currently seeing stabilization and momentum building in our business, fueled by innovative product and Nike brand consumer experiences leveraging digital. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds such as committed credit facilities and commercial paper programs, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future. In fiscal 2019, we plan to continue investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, including corporate facilities, expanding our digital capabilities and new Nike Direct stores, and, beginning in fiscal 2019, we anticipate the functional currency of our Argentina subsidiary within our APLA operating segment will change from the local currency to U.S. dollars as the subsidiary will be operating in a hyper-inflationary market, resulting in non-U.S. dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities being subject to re-measurement and recorded in other expense (income), net.

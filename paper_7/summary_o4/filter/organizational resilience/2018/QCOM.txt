In fiscal 2018, in response to adverse conditions including regulatory investigations by the European Commission and Taiwan Fair Trade Commission, legal disputes with key licensees such as Apple and its contract manufacturers, the termination of the proposed NXP acquisition, and volatility in global tax and trade environments, we executed a comprehensive cost plan designed to realign our cost structure to long-term margin targets—targeting $1 billion of annual savings through a series of targeted actions across our businesses, which resulted in $687 million of restructuring and restructuring-related charges and anticipates up to $100 million more—to preserve operational continuity and maintain performance under pressure.  At the same time, we continued to absorb market strain and deploy resources to sustain innovation and business continuity by investing significant resources in 4G and 5G technologies, RF front-end modules via our RF360 Holdings joint venture, and adjacent industry segments such as automotive, Internet of Things and networking; we realigned segment reporting to reflect pre-commercial research and development activity and revised segment cost allocations to support future growth trajectories.  We also preserved system resilience by proactively managing liquidity and capital resources—redeploying over $22 billion to share repurchases, repaying $5.5 billion of debt, maintaining access to our $5 billion revolving credit and commercial paper facilities, and adjusting our global tax structure in response to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act—to ensure integrity and partial performance maintenance while positioning the organization to absorb future disturbances, adapt to evolving competitive landscapes and emerge stronger from challenging and unexpected conditions.

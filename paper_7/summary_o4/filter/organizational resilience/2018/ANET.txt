We intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization to enhance the functionality of our existing cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features, and build upon our technology leadership; we have and may continue to accelerate our investment in infrastructure, such as enterprise resource planning software and other technologies to improve the efficiency of our operations. We engineer our products to be agnostic to the underlying merchant silicon architecture, combining our eos software with merchant silicon into a family of switching and routing products, which enables us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve cost-effective solutions. We currently procure certain merchant silicon components from multiple vendors, and we continue to expand our relationships with these and other vendors, working closely with third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture our products, deliver them to our direct fulfillment facilities, and then perform labeling, final configuration, quality assurance testing and shipment to our customers. We have experienced unpredictability in the timing of large orders, especially with respect to our large end customers, due to the complexity of orders, the time it takes end customers to evaluate, test, qualify and accept our products and factors specific to our end customers; due to these factors, we expect continued variability in our customer concentration and timing of sales on a quarterly and annual basis. We believe that our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and our growth strategies for at least the next 12 months, and our marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly-rated securities with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. We record a provision when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand, or obsolete, to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value, and we record a liability and a corresponding charge for non-cancellable, non-returnable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers or suppliers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts; we use significant judgment in establishing our forecasts of future demand and obsolete material exposures and regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and adequacy of our contract manufacturer liabilities. We generate revenue primarily from sales of our switching products which incorporate our eos software and from post contract support, or pcs, which end customers typically purchase in conjunction with our products; pcs is offered under renewable, fee-based contracts and we initially defer pcs revenue and recognize it ratably over the life of the pcs contract as there is no discernable pattern of delivery related to these promises. For contracts which contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate revenue to each distinct performance obligation based on the standalone selling price, with judgment required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations, and our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of our spending to support research and development activities, the timing and cost of establishing additional sales and marketing capabilities, the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings, our costs associated with supply chain activities, our costs related to investing in or acquiring complementary or strategic businesses and technologies, the continued market acceptance of our products, and costs incurred related to outstanding litigation claims. We believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, although we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different.

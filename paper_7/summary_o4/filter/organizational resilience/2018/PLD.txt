In 2018, operating fundamentals remained strong for our O&M portfolio and we ended the year with occupancy of 97.5%, historic low vacancies, strong customer and investor demand, record-long lease terms and a strong balance sheet, and with these dispositions we completed our O&M disposition program of non-strategic assets generating approximately $14 billion in proceeds resulting in our O&M operating portfolio being focused on the highest-quality properties in the best markets. We have seen no signs of slowness based on our operating metrics and remain positive on our outlook; however, given current market volatility caused by trade and tariff disputes and uncertainty regarding the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union, we will continue to be prudent in running our business. We evaluate our business operations based on the NOI of our two operating segments, real estate operations and strategic capital, considering NOI by segment to be an appropriate supplemental measure because it helps management and investors understand our core operations, and we manage our business and review our operating fundamentals on an O&M basis to understand the entire impact to the financial statements across both segments and our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. We retained more than 70% of our customers, based on the total square feet of leases commenced, and despite increased turnover costs per square foot, longer lease terms resulted in a lower cost as a percentage of lease value, demonstrating operational flexibility and customer-focused resilience. We consider our ability to generate cash from operating activities, distributions from our co-investment ventures, contributions and dispositions of properties and available financing sources to be adequate to meet anticipated future development, acquisition, operating, debt service, dividend and distribution requirements, and while adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact refinancing, capital market activities, debt maturity management, future growth and development and acquisition activity, we were in compliance with all financial debt covenants at December 31, 2018. We assess the carrying values of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable and recognize impairment charges when carrying values exceed estimated fair values based on internal cash flow forecasts, market rent assumptions and capitalization rates. Our dividend policy balances REIT distribution requirements with the retention of cash to fund capital improvements and investment activities, and certain co-investment ventures have equity commitments from us and our partners that may be fulfilled in cash or property contributions, enabling resource reconfiguration. We use core FFO, as modified by Prologis, reconciled to net earnings and adjusted for foreign currency, deferred income tax and nonrecurring items, to assess our operating performance by segment and region, to budget and forecast future results, to provide guidance to the financial markets and to evaluate how specific potential investments will impact our future results, thereby supporting strategic foresight and resilience in a turbulent environment.

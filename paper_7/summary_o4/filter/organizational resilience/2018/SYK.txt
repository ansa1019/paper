In 2018, management pursued high‚Äêend industry sales growth while preserving positive adjustment under challenging conditions by maintaining a capital allocation strategy that prioritized targeted acquisitions of K2M and Entellus, dividends and share repurchases, thereby reconfiguring resources to strengthen core capabilities and ensure business continuity; the modified retrospective adoption of ASC 606 and the use of non-GAAP financial measures to isolate underlying performance trends under foreign-currency fluctuations and accounting changes reflected a systemic perspective on preserving integrity and comparability of operating results amid internal and external disturbances; the issuance and refinancing of senior unsecured notes across multiple currencies and maturities, together with the transfer of intellectual property to generate deferred tax assets, demonstrated strategic deployment of financial resources and access to capital markets to support future adaptability; robust operating cash flows supplemented by debt funding, global cash management, available credit facilities and a commercial paper program underpinned liquidity management and operational continuity despite economic pressures; risk mitigation and crisis-response capabilities were evidenced by provisions for product recalls, insurance recoveries, legal and tax contingencies, and pension funding uncertainties; ongoing investments in research, development and engineering, operating-expense improvement initiatives and inventory reserves illustrated efforts to absorb strain, mitigate risks, and sustain productivity and performance under adverse mix, inflationary and regulatory constraints; and rigorous goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing embodied forward-looking resilience strategies to maintain system integrity and performance in a volatile environment.

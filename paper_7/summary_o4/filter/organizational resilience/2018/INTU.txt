our growth strategy depends upon our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new markets and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market, reflecting strategic agility amid a dynamic expansion of cloud-based services where high availability and speed of service reshape customer expectations and accelerate product introductions and enhancements. we have aligned our segment reporting with our core customers and business partners, reclassified prior period segment amounts to conform to the current presentation and completed divestitures of non-core businesses with immaterial cash flows, actions that reinforce our organizational coherence and focus. recognizing that as we offer more online services, the ongoing operation and availability of our platforms and systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important to business continuity, we are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities, implementing additional security measures for our consumer and professional tax offerings and collaborating with industry and government to protect against fraud. we continuously evaluate the merits of acquiring technology or businesses and establishing strategic relationships, supported by a strong liquidity profile, undrawn revolving credit facility and disciplined cash and capital management that we expect to be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, contractual obligations and debt service requirements for at least the next 12 months, thereby preserving operational flexibility and resource deployment under nominal and extreme conditions. in assessing goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment and in estimating fair values in business combinations, we exercise significant judgment in projecting future cash flows, determining discount rates and evaluating market comparables to test recoverability in the face of changing underlying assumptions. our management of legal contingencies and uncertain tax positions, including the recording of liabilities for probable losses and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, further demonstrates risk mitigation practices designed to maintain financial integrity under evolving regulatory and fiscal environments. together, these practices underscore our capacity to absorb strain, adapt resource allocation and preserve organizational functioning despite internal or external variations and pressures, consistent with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

We believe that pursuing research in diverse areas allows us to balance the risks inherent in drug development and may provide drug candidates that will form our pipeline in future years. We closely monitor the results of our discovery, research, clinical trials and nonclinical studies and frequently evaluate our drug development programs in light of new data and scientific, business and commercial insights, with the objective of balancing risk and potential, acknowledging that this process can result in abrupt changes in focus and priorities as new information becomes available and as we gain additional understanding of our ongoing programs and potential new programs, as well as those of our competitors. Our corporate compliance program is designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems and through the promotion of a culture of compliance to support the maintenance of business continuity under extensive and complex laws and regulations. We dedicate substantial management and other resources in order to obtain and maintain appropriate levels of reimbursement for our products from third-party payors and continue to engage in discussions with numerous commercial insurers, managed health care organizations and governmental authorities in ex-U.S. markets to ensure ongoing patient access. We have entered into collaborations with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to acquire rights or license drug candidates or technologies that enhance our pipeline and our research capabilities, making upfront payments, assuming program costs, agreeing to contingent milestone and royalty payments and, where appropriate, out-licensing internally developed programs to shift development and commercialization costs while retaining potential future revenue streams. We hold strategic equity investments in publicly traded and private companies and expect their fair-value fluctuations to have material impacts on our income, reflecting our exposure to external disturbances and our ongoing adjustment of financial resources. In managing our liquidity, we intend to rely on existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash flows from product sales, may borrow under a revolving credit facility and otherwise consider all financing opportunities to strengthen our long-term liquidity profile, and expect that our cash flows from CF products together with current resources will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. We forecast and adjust our estimates of government and private payor rebates, discounts and fees, defer and recognize revenue under capped reimbursement agreements based on forecasts of distributed units, and constrain estimates of variable consideration to the amount that is probable not to reverse, recognizing that changes in these estimates and the timing or amount of net product revenues could have a material effect on our financial results. We regularly reassess our valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, and in the fourth quarter of 2018 released the majority of our valuation allowance, resulting in a non-cash benefit of $1.56 billion, and expect to utilize our net operating losses to offset income in 2019 while recording a provision for income taxes as deferred tax assets are realized. Beginning January 1, 2019, we will apply ASC 842 to our primary facility leases, requiring us to determine whether such leases are financing or operating, and anticipate significant shifts in the classification of expenses and balance sheet presentation as we adapt our accounting treatment to these new requirements.

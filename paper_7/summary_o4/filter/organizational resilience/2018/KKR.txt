KKR & Co. Inc. emphasizes maintenance of organizational resilience through continuous adjustment of its investment and liquidity strategies to preserve or improve performance under nominal, extreme or exceptional economic disturbances. Management routinely monitors global and regional financial and economic conditions—including equity and credit market volatility, interest-rate fluctuations, currency movements and trade uncertainties—and responds with operational flexibility, diversified resource allocation across private equity, infrastructure, real estate and credit strategies, and systematic hedging of exposures to sustain business continuity. By seizing market‐dislocation opportunities, strategically deploying capital, and balancing fee-based revenues, carried interest realizations, dividends, interest income and debt financing, the firm ensures it can absorb strain, fund capital commitments, service obligations and support new strategic initiatives. Robust governance and fair-value measurement policies, including global and asset-class valuation committees and consistent accounting practices for consolidated and unconsolidated vehicles, reinforce transparency, risk mitigation and adaptive capacity. Complemented by committed credit facilities, senior notes, a flexible dividend policy and share repurchase authorizations, KKR’s resilience framework enables positive adjustment and sustained functioning under challenging conditions.

The Company continues to invest in the development of its services, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth and ensure operational continuity, delivering its software via the internet through an easy-to-use, consumer-product-like interface that can be easily configured and rapidly deployed, while also supporting internal deployments or third-party hosting to meet unique regulatory or security requirements. It offers annual subscription services, priced based on subscription term, volume, product mix and discounts, that include access to ordered services, related support, updates, hosting, data backup and disaster recovery; these subscriptions are generally non-cancelable and recognized ratably over the term, with self-hosted software recognized upon delivery and related support recognized over the contract period. To manage demand and liquidity, the Company measures customer renewal rates—calculated based on ACV and adjusted for acquisitions, consolidations and other customer events—tracks total backlog of unbilled backlog, deferred revenue and customer deposits with approximately fifty percent expected to be recognized within the following twelve months, and uses billings as a leading indicator of performance, disclosing adjustments for foreign currency rate fluctuations and billing duration. It defines free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, viewing it as an indicator of operational strength, and calculates average contract terms weighted by ACV and restated for acquisitions, spin-offs and customer mapping changes to enhance comparability. Cost of subscription and professional services reflects data center capacity costs, interconnectivity, dedicated infrastructure hardware, software, IT services and support, personnel-related costs and allocated overhead, while incremental selling costs—sales commissions and referral fees—are capitalized as deferred commissions and amortized over a five-year period of benefit or over the average renewal term. To mitigate currency exposure, the Company initiated a limited hedging program using foreign currency derivative contracts with maturities of twelve months or less to hedge a portion of its net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities, and it maintains sufficient cash, cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations to meet its liquidity needs, including data center expansion, lease obligations and headcount growth, for at least the next twelve months. Seasonality in contract timing, collections and disbursements—driven by annual sales quotas, budget cycles, commission payouts and employee stock purchase plan purchases—is managed through forecasting and planning of operating and investing cash flows. Collectively, these practices are designed to absorb strain, preserve integrity and performance under varying market, currency and operational pressures and to support the Company in responding effectively to environmental disruptions while maintaining business continuity.

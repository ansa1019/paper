Boeing indicates that it remains vulnerable to exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics and increased global environmental regulations and continues to monitor the potential for any disruption and adverse revenue and/or cost impacts that may result from tariffs, trade disputes, sanctions or other geopolitical economic developments. The company continues to work with its customers to mitigate risks associated with the expiration of the Export-Import Bank’s charter by assisting them with alternative third-party financing sources and anticipates that it will not be required to fund a significant portion of its financing commitments as it continues to arrange financing through external sources. Supply chain delays were recognized as having adversely affected the timing of 737 deliveries in 2018, yet the company plans to increase production rates and improve cost performance, reflecting its adaptation to operational constraints. Boeing regularly reviews program accounting quantities, total sales and cost estimates, making cumulative catch-up adjustments and, where estimated costs to complete programs exceed estimated revenues, records reach-forward losses immediately in earnings, exemplifying dynamic contract and risk management processes. The company assesses the viability of aircraft programs such as the 747 and determined that ending production at the current accounting quantity would not have a material impact on its financial position or cash flows. In the event of further production, technical or quality issues, Boeing acknowledges the potential for additional reach-forward losses, schedule delays, certification challenges and exposure under termination provisions, and actively evaluates customer claims and requests for contractual relief. Boeing believes its borrowing capacity, including commercial paper and revolving credit lines, should provide adequate financial flexibility to satisfy commitments, fund strategic business opportunities and respond to contingency events. Through continuous investment in new products and services, research and development, cost-reduction efforts and strategic initiatives—including the launch of next-generation programs and expansion into adjacent markets—the company seeks to maintain performance and integrity under internal and external variations and disturbances, preserve operating margins and emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

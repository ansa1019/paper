During fiscal 2018, the company generated $13.0 billion of net cash from operating activities, maintained $1.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents (including $1.4 billion held by foreign subsidiaries), and issued $3.5 billion of long-term debt, supplemented by $3.0 billion aggregate borrowing capacity under commercial paper programs and fully available $3.0 billion backup credit facilities, which collectively ensure continued access to liquidity and alternative financing sources to meet operating requirements, fund planned capital expenditures of approximately $2.7 billion in fiscal 2019, support dividend payments, share repurchases, and long-term debt maturities without expected covenant impacts. The use of derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate exposures, retention of self-insured liabilities for general liability, workers’ compensation and medical claims, and quarterly impairment assessments of long-lived assets based on undiscounted future cash flows with fair value measurements further mitigate risks and preserve asset integrity. Operating cash flows reflect proactive working capital management under variable conditions—including seasonality, inventory management, vendor payment terms, and foreign exchange rate fluctuations—and inventory valuation under the retail inventory method is adjusted for current market conditions to approximate lower of cost or market, thereby safeguarding gross profit. Capital and operating leases financing stores, distribution centers and support centers, along with strategic vendor allowances accrual for volume rebates and co-op advertising, provide flexibility in resource deployment. Through consistent expense control, expense leverage, incremental investments in the business, structured share repurchase programs authorized at $15.0 billion, and supplementation of GAAP measures with non-GAAP metrics such as return on invested capital to enhance transparency and performance assessment, the company demonstrates adaptability, strategic resource allocation, and operational continuity to sustain performance under internal and external variations and disturbances.

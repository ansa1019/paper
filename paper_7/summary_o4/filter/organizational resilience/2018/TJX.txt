The Company’s management discussion and analysis underscores its systematic approach to identifying and managing risks and uncertainties—including those described in Part I, Item 1A—and employs forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions to project future performance. In anticipation of Brexit, our European operations evaluated a range of potential outcomes, identified areas of concern and operational risks, and implemented mitigation strategies by developing a plan to realign the European supply chain to reduce merchandise flows between the U.K. and the EU, establishing dedicated resources and systems to support this plan and maintaining ongoing communication with associates regarding any additional procedures. To further mitigate external disturbances, we routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments to absorb currency fluctuations on merchandise purchases, recording mark-to-market adjustments that are offset as hedged inventory is received. The Company continues to invest in existing and new distribution centers—reflected in higher supply chain costs—and leverages incentive compensation and wage investments to sustain operational flexibility and support growth across over 4,300 stores globally. Liquidity is managed through internally generated funds supplemented by short-term borrowings and credit facilities, with $3.0 billion in cash and equivalents as of February 2, 2019, deemed adequate to meet operating needs. Capital expenditures of $1.1 billion in fiscal 2019—and an anticipated $1.5 billion in fiscal 2020—are directed toward offices, distribution centers, store renovations and new store openings, reinforcing our capacity to maintain performance under varying conditions. Rigorous impairment testing of long-lived assets, goodwill and tradenames employs discounted cash flow models and cost-to-retail inventory valuation methods with shrinkage estimates, while reserves for uncertain tax positions and loss contingencies are established based on technical merit analyses and legal counsel assessments. Discretionary reinvestments of 2017 Tax Act benefits into associate bonuses, retirement plans and charitable contributions, along with the annuitization and transfer of pension obligations through group annuity contracts, further exemplify our dynamic resource reconfiguration and risk mitigation practices. Through these coordinated strategies—supply chain realignment, financial hedging, capital deployment, liquidity management, impairment and contingency reserves, and targeted reinvestments—TJX demonstrates an ability to absorb strain, adapt to external pressures and preserve or improve operational functioning in challenging conditions.

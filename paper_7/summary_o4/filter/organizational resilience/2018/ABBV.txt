AbbVie’s discussion highlights multiple facets of organizational resilience, including its strategic focus “on delivering strong financial results, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term,” the “continued added funding to support all stages of AbbVie’s emerging pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVie’s growth brands,” and its intent to “pursue strategies intended to further differentiate Humira from competing products and add to the sustainability of Humira.” The company’s approach to maintaining operational flexibility and preserving performance under market pressures is reflected in its plans to “achieve [expanded operating margins] through continued leverage from revenue growth, the reduction of Humira royalty expense, productivity initiatives in supply chain and ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses.” AbbVie’s resilience in research and development is evidenced by its response to clinical setbacks—recognizing a $5.1 billion intangible asset impairment charge related to IPR&D after stopping enrollment in the Tahoe trial due to lower probabilities of success, while simultaneously increasing “funding to support all stages of the company’s pipeline assets.” The company’s liquidity management and risk mitigation practices further demonstrate adaptive capability, as it “may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed,” believes it has “sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms,” and in 2018 replaced its existing credit facility with a new $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility. Finally, ongoing evaluation of contractual obligations, including contingent consideration liabilities and rebate and chargeback reserves, underscores AbbVie’s systemic perspective on preserving integrity and performance despite external variations, constraints and uncertainties.

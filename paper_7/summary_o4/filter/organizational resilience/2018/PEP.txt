PepsiCo has instituted an integrated risk management framework designed to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions by continuously monitoring macroeconomic, political, regulatory and competitive pressures across its global operations; this framework is overseen by the board of directors and its designated committees and executed by cross‐functional senior management risk committees, a dedicated risk management office, corporate audit and compliance functions to identify, assess, prioritize, mitigate and communicate top strategic, financial, operating, safety, reputational and compliance risks. The company addresses environmental perturbations such as civil unrest, natural disasters, currency fluctuations and shifts in consumer preferences through a combination of business continuity measures—diversified supply sourcing, authorized bottler networks and flexible distribution models—and systemic initiatives that include the reengineering of go‐to‐market and information systems, automation of processes, optimization of manufacturing and supply chain footprints, and ongoing productivity plans targeting severance, asset impairments and technology‐driven efficiency. PepsiCo further preserves integrity and performance by deploying hedging strategies for commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate exposures; executing global purchasing programs and fixed‐price contracts; managing liquidity via revolving credit facilities, commercial paper and long‐term debt financing; and pursuing structural actions such as acquisitions, divestitures, refranchising and joint ventures. Together, these strategic tools and resilience strategies enable the company to absorb strain, reconfigure resource allocation, safeguard operational flexibility and sustain competitive advantage and organizational health in nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

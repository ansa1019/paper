In response to the continuing shift from an offline to online world, we have adapted by expanding and evolving our product offerings and monetization approaches to serve changing user and advertiser needs across diverse devices and modalities, and we continue to develop localized versions of our products and relevant advertising programs in emerging markets to absorb environmental and currency pressures. We maintain a foreign exchange risk management program to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates and use non-GAAP constant currency metrics to evaluate period-to-period performance, thereby mitigating external disturbances. We plan to invest heavily in research and development, capital expenditures for data centers, facilities and IT infrastructure, and strategic acquisitions that enhance the breadth and depth of our offerings and expand our engineering and functional expertise, reflecting our commitment to reconfigure resources, foster innovation and preserve operational continuity. We bolster our financial resilience through diversified cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, short-term commercial paper and revolving credit facilities, which we believe will satisfy anticipated cash requirements, capital expenditures, working capital needs and potential acquisitions for at least the next 12 months. Our employees are among our best assets, and we continue to hire and provide competitive compensation programs to support ongoing service innovation and business continuity. We regularly assess the likelihood of litigation and loss contingencies, adjust reserves and disclosures as appropriate, and review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable, ensuring ongoing risk assessment, partial maintenance of performance under pressure and future orientation toward positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

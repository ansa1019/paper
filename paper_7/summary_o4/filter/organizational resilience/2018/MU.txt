Management reported that total net sales for fiscal 2018 increased 50% year-over-year driven by strong execution in delivering high-value 1xnm DRAM and 64-layer 3D NAND technologies amid favorable market conditions across key markets, with increases in DRAM and NAND volumes enabled by higher manufacturing output resulting from improvements in product and process technology and solid execution. The overall gross margin percentage improved to 59% for 2018 from 42% for 2017 primarily due to favorable market conditions, advanced technology delivery and manufacturing cost reductions. To reflect extended equipment reuse and lengthening periods between technology node transitions, the estimated useful lives of equipment in the Company’s DRAM wafer fabrication facilities were revised from five to seven years in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company continues to invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities and equipment, and research and development to support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality, sharing the cost of certain product and process development activities under agreements with partners including Intel for joint development of NAND and 3D XPoint technologies, while in the second quarter of 2018 agreeing to independently develop subsequent generations of 3D NAND and, in the fourth quarter of 2018, ceasing joint development of further 3D XPoint generations to better optimize technology and products for each party’s business needs. The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations—highly dependent on selling prices for its products—and financing from capital markets and financial institutions, and management continuously evaluates alternatives for efficiently funding capital expenditures and ongoing operations, maintaining an undrawn $2.00 billion revolving credit facility and expecting that cash, investments, cash flows from operations, and available financing will be sufficient to meet requirements at least through the next 12 months. To mitigate credit risk, investments are placed through high-credit-quality financial institutions with limited concentration per obligor. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with write-downs recorded to cost of goods sold when analyses of projected selling prices and volumes indicate values below manufacturing cost, reflecting the volatile nature of memory and storage markets and the need to preserve financial performance. Property, plant, and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that carrying values may not be recoverable from expected undiscounted cash flows, recognizing charges when fair values are lower, and contingent commitments and contractual obligations are continuously monitored to ensure operational continuity. Management judgments and estimates are applied to consolidation decisions for variable interest entities, accounting for acquisitions, income tax provisions and deferred tax assets, and critical accounting estimates, all requiring assumptions about future performance, market conditions, and regulatory outcomes to preserve the integrity of financial reporting under changing environmental and operational conditions.

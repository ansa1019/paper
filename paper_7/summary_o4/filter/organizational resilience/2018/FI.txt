Our enterprise priorities and management actions reflect a multifaceted approach to sustaining performance under internal and external disturbances by actively reviewing and reconfiguring our portfolio to acquire businesses that address compelling strategic needs—such as products, services or technologies that meet client demand or change industry dynamics—and divest those that no longer align with our market, product or financial strategies, thereby reallocating resources to preserve and enhance operating effectiveness. We focus on enhancing the overall value of existing client relationships, differentiating our products and services through innovation, and achieving economies of scale in infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks to remain competitive amid a challenging operating environment shaped by evolving regulatory and cybersecurity pressures and rapid technological change. Our recurring, transaction-based revenue model, diverse client base and integration of offerings create operational flexibility and strategic foresight that mitigate the impact of consolidation, client attrition and market volatility. We maintain liquidity and capital resilience through strong operating cash flow, cash and cash equivalents of $415 million and available borrowings under our $850 million revolving credit facility, which we have amended to extend maturity to 2023, permit increased leverage post-acquisition and enable timely drawings for our pending First Data merger. In support of that merger, we secured $17 billion of bridge financing and $5 billion of term loan commitments to refinance indebtedness, fund merger consideration and cover transaction costs, illustrating our proactive resource generation and risk mitigation strategies. Furthermore, our use of transition services agreements for joint ventures, disciplined capital allocation to capital expenditures, debt repayment and share repurchases, improvements in cost of processing and services through operating leverage and expense management, and rigorous evaluation of performance obligations underscore our systemic perspective on maintaining integrity and performance in both nominal and exceptional conditions.

The Bank’s 2018 Form 10-K disclosures emphasize a comprehensive, enterprise-wide resilience framework designed to sustain functioning and performance under internal or external perturbations. Management articulates a formal risk appetite and seven key risk categories—strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational—overseen by the board and its committees, supported by three lines of defense (front-line units, independent risk management and corporate audit) to continuously identify, measure, monitor and control exposures. The corporation employs forward-looking stress testing and a capital adequacy assessment (ICAAP) to project capital and liquidity needs under baseline and severely adverse scenarios, and maintains contingency funding, capital contingency and financial recovery plans that invoke pre-approved actions such as asset sales, de-risking strategies and access to central bank facilities. Liquidity resilience is reinforced through Global Liquidity Sources—cash and high-quality unencumbered securities available across legal entities—and diversified funding via stable deposit growth, secured financing, securitizations and long-term debt issuances. Operational flexibility and business continuity measures include Brexit preparations to “minimize transition risks and retain operational flexibility,” a global information security program to combat cyber-attacks, and resolution planning (single-point-of-entry) supported by intercompany credit facilities and subordinated notes. Management’s discussion of strategic risk emphasizes the need to “respond effectively to environmental disruptions,” realign resource deployment, and adapt business models, pricing and operating structures, while capital management integrates risk-adjusted returns, capital allocation and stress buffer requirements to preserve integrity and emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

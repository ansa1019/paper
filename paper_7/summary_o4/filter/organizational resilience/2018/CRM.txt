Our forward-looking statements concerning our outlook and future plans reflect our recognition that maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions requires the ability to absorb strain, reconfigure resources and preserve functioning despite internal and external pressures.  Key elements of our strategy—to extend existing service offerings, reduce customer attrition, expand and strengthen our partner ecosystem, extend go-to-market capabilities, ensure strong customer adoption and encourage third-party application development—are designed to promote business continuity, operational flexibility and competitive advantage in turbulent markets.  We identify factors that could impede our objectives, including customers’ willingness to migrate to cloud services, service availability, performance and security, successful integration of acquired technologies, evolving privacy regulations, competitive product offerings, data-center capacity and location, third-party developer participation, talent attraction and retention, and general economic conditions; we mitigate these risks through substantial investments in data-center expansion, cybersecurity measures, high-quality technical support, strategic partnerships and customer-retention programs.  Our growth investments—increasing data-center capacity via internal build and third-party infrastructure, hiring additional personnel in sales, customer success and research and development, expanding domestic and international marketing, developing new community and industry clouds, integrating acquisitions such as MuleSoft and Datorama, and pursuing further complementary business combinations—support our ability to adapt, transform and emerge stronger from disruptive change.  We likewise capitalize costs to obtain customer contracts, amortized over the average benefit period, deploy overhead and third-party technology fees, and allocate resources across operating segments to promote resilient resource deployment and system integrity.  Our continued R&D focus on new features, security enhancements and a scalable, single-tenant architecture, together with disciplined acquisition processes and a robust capital expenditure program for global infrastructure and office build-outs, underpin our dynamic capabilities and absorptive capacity.  We maintain a $1 billion credit facility, manage substantial unearned revenue and remaining performance obligations to fund working-capital needs, and expect existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, operating cash flows and borrowing capacity to suffice for the next twelve months.  In support of organizational resilience and sustainability, we commit to carbon neutrality, net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, 100 percent renewable energy by fiscal 2022 through virtual power purchase agreements, and integrate environmental, social and governance initiatives—equal pay analyses, diversity and inclusion “ohana” groups, the 1-1-1 philanthropy model and stakeholder impact reporting—to foster long-term adaptability, stakeholder engagement and positive adjustment under adverse conditions.

Nee’s rate-regulated electric utility business mitigates commodity price volatility and extreme weather impacts by deferring changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions as regulatory assets or liabilities until settlement and passing gains or losses through fuel and storm-recovery clause mechanisms, while maintaining securitized storm-recovery costs, a storm fund and storm reserve to support restoration efforts following hurricanes. The company’s policy of funding nuclear decommissioning and plant dismantlement costs over the service lives of the assets, investing restricted funds in liquid and longer-term fixed income and equity securities, and periodically updating actuarial and escalation assumptions demonstrates a systemic perspective on preserving system integrity under internal and external disturbances. NEE, FPL and NEECH rely on diversified liquidity sources—including operating cash flows, short- and long-term borrowings, equity issuances and differential membership investments—supported by substantial revolving credit and term loan facilities, letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees, investment-grade credit ratings and compliance with funded-debt-to-capitalization covenants, to ensure operational flexibility, business continuity and rapid resource deployment in response to regulatory, legal and market developments. Oversight by an exposure management committee and use of master netting agreements, credit enhancements and value-at-risk monitoring for energy, interest rate and equity exposures enable rigorous risk assessment, mitigation and reconfiguration of financial trajectories, thereby reinforcing the organization’s ability to absorb strain, maintain performance and adapt its strategic and financial structure under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

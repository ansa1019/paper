Management observes that “our cash generated from operations continues to be a significant source of funds for investing in our growth, including acquisitions and strategic alliances, managing our contingencies and reducing our debt levels,” and that “our investment grade credit profile reflects the size and diversity of our product portfolio, our leading share position in several of our served markets, our strong cash flow, our solid financial fundamentals and our financial strategy.”  Based on our current business plan, “we believe our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents, future cash generated from operations and access to capital markets and credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations, invest in our infrastructure, pay our legal-related liabilities, pay taxes due, fund possible mergers and/or acquisitions and service and repay our existing debt.”  We invest excess cash on hand in short-term financial instruments that earn market interest rates while mitigating principal risk through instrument and counterparty diversification.  We remain committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses in order to maintain a healthy pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growth.  The primary factor contributing to the increase in our gross profit margin for 2016, as compared to 2015, was the positive impact of cost reductions as a result of our restructuring and other process improvement programs, and the 2016 restructuring plan is expected to result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $175 million to $225 million and reduce gross annual expenses by approximately $115 million to $150 million by the end of 2020 as program benefits are realized.  On December 12, 2016, we completed the acquisition of certain manufacturing assets and capabilities of the Neovasc, Inc. advanced biological tissue business and made a 15 percent equity investment in Neovasc for a total upfront cash payment of $75 million; with this acquisition, we will integrate certain manufacturing assets and biologic tissue capabilities into our structural heart business for use in the manufacturing of the Lotus valve system and future heart valve technologies within our interventional cardiology business, and we expect this integration to be substantially completed by the end of 2018.  On December 31, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the interventional radiology business of Celonova Biosciences, including drug-eluting microspheres and spherical embolic products, and we are in the process of integrating Celonova into our peripheral interventions business with substantial completion expected by the second half of 2017.  On November 22, 2016, we completed our acquisition of EndoChoice, began the process of integrating EndoChoice into our endoscopy business in the fourth quarter of 2016 and expect to be substantially complete by the end of 2017.  On August 3, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the American Medical Systems male urology portfolio, which was integrated with our formerly named urology and women’s health business to form our urology and pelvic health business, with the integration substantially complete by the end of 2016.  On July 27, 2016, we acquired Cosman Medical, Inc., expanding our neuromodulation portfolio and offering physicians treating patients with chronic pain a wider choice of non-opioid therapeutic options; we are in the process of integrating Cosman into our neuromodulation business and expect the integration to be substantially complete by the end of 2017.  As part of our strategic imperative to drive global expansion, we have increased our investment in infrastructure in emerging markets in order to maximize opportunities.  Our liquidity plans, which include maintaining full access to our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility and $240 million of available borrowings under our credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables, are designed to support our operations and strategic initiatives but remain subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including macroeconomic conditions, adverse litigation outcomes and other risk factors that could limit our ability to successfully execute our business plans and adversely affect our liquidity plans.

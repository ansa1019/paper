Lam Research has actively mitigated the cyclicality of the semiconductor capital equipment industry through market-driven consolidation among its customers and by maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves to support sustained levels of investment in research and development and capital infrastructure, as reflected in cash, cash equivalents and investments balances growing from $4.2 billion to $7.1 billion, and by deploying $1.4 billion of operating cash flow in fiscal 2016 toward principal debt payments, capital expenditures, dividends, treasury stock purchases and equity-based compensation obligations to preserve operational flexibility under varying economic conditions. The company responds to technology inflections such as 3D NAND, multiple patterning, FinFET and advanced packaging by expanding its served addressable market and continuing to gain market share, while making significant R&D investments focused on leading-edge deposition, plasma etch, single-wafer clean and other semiconductor manufacturing requirements, with increased headcount, facility and IT spending, supplies, depreciation and lab maintenance, and campus consolidation costs. Lam’s revenue recognition policies for multiple-element arrangements, extended maintenance service contracts, and lapsing customer acceptance periods, together with periodic assessments of inventory valuation, warranty reserves and deferred revenue, ensure that disruptions in customer demand or adverse market conditions prompt timely write-downs or adjustments, thereby supporting the maintenance of integrity and performance under internal or external variations. The company’s critical accounting estimates, including valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on a more-likely-than-not realization threshold, uncertain tax positions recognized only upon sufficient technical merit, and annual goodwill impairment analyses driven by discounted cash flow forecasts, enable it to reconfigure its balance sheet, manage risks of global economic weakness or industry downturns and adjust its capital structure through convertible senior notes, senior notes due 2020, 2021, 2023 and 2026, a $1.53 billion term loan facility and a $750 million revolving credit agreement, all featuring covenants, redemption provisions and hedge and warrant structures designed to provide access to capital markets on adequate terms and to support strategic initiatives, risk mitigation and business continuity in the face of evolving technological, economic and regulatory pressures.

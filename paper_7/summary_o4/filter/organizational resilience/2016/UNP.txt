During 2016, the company demonstrated its capacity to maintain positive operations under challenging conditions by sustaining a “continuous improvement culture” through programs such as courage to care and total safety culture, achieving record‐low personal injury and derailment incident rates and deploying a multi‐faceted approach to safety that utilizes technology, risk assessment, training, employee engagement, quality control, and targeted capital investments to further detect rail defects, improve or close crossings, and educate the public and law enforcement about crossing safety.  Network fluidity and operational flexibility were enhanced as average train speed increased 5% and terminal dwell time decreased 4% year-over-year, reflecting resource realignment and improved network operations that, together with core pricing gains and productivity initiatives, partially offset a 7% volume decline and supported our third-best earnings performance despite the second lowest carload volumes since 1998.  Looking ahead, we will continue to align resources with customer demand, maintain surge capability, and adapt our capital plan—expected at approximately $3.1 billion in 2017 and subject to revision if business conditions or regulatory developments warrant—to balance renewal and improvement of existing assets, invest in technology enhancements (including positive train control), and support commercial growth while preserving financial resilience.  Free cash flow of $2.3 billion, defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities and dividends, underscores our ability to generate cash without additional external financings, and we maintain adequate resources and committed credit capacity—via a $1.7 billion revolving credit facility, a $650 million receivables securitization facility, commercial paper and capital markets access—to meet foreseeable liquidity needs.  We expect continued margin improvement driven by pricing opportunities, ongoing productivity initiatives, and the ability to leverage our resources and strengthen our franchise, while managing uncertainties such as energy market outlook, fuel price volatility and potential rating downgrades, and preserving system integrity and performance through proactive risk mitigation, resource realignment, and operational efficiencies.

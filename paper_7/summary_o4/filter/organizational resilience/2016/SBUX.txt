During fiscal 2016 and in preparing for fiscal 2017, Starbucks demonstrated its ability to absorb strain and preserve performance under challenging conditions by actively managing liquidity, capital and risk in order to maintain positive adjustment when faced with internal and external disturbances.  The company internally funded operating needs, acquisitions and shareholder returns through disciplined cash and investment management—growing cash and investments from $1.9 billion to $3.4 billion—while complying with covenants on a $1.5 billion unsecured credit facility, a $1 billion commercial paper program and long-term debt issuances earmarked for sustainability projects in its coffee supply chain.  Capital expenditures of $1.4 billion in fiscal 2016 and $1.6 billion planned for fiscal 2017 on new stores, remodels, system and technology investments amplified operational flexibility and resource reconfiguration.  Sales leverage and lower commodity costs, partially offset by partner (employee) and digital platform investments, drove margin expansion and exemplified adaptive resource allocation.  The company’s market price risk management policy employs embedded pricing features, commodity hedges and foreign-currency and interest-rate derivatives to mitigate volatility in green coffee, dairy, currencies and debt financing, preserving system integrity under environmental perturbations.  Strategic acquisitions and joint venture ownership changes—including the full consolidation of Starbucks Japan—reconstituted its international operating model, balanced the mix of company-operated and licensed stores, and reallocated resources toward sustained growth.  By indefinitely reinvesting foreign earnings, monitoring counterparty credit risk, and structuring purchase and lease commitments (notably 90 percent of green coffee through binding contracts), Starbucks reinforced its organizational resilience, ensuring business continuity and competitive advantage amid disruptive change.

Danaher’s MD&A discloses that as a diversified, global business, its geographic and industry diversity as well as the range of its products and services help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results, reflecting a systemic perspective on environmental perturbations and organizational coherence. Management monitors key competitors and customers, including their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future, and makes significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to address rapid technological developments and to globalize manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources in order to be responsive to customer needs throughout the world, improve operational efficiency and preserve firm performance under challenging conditions. The company applies the Danaher Business System to integrate acquisitions such as Pall and Cepheid, realize cost synergies, and reconfigure resource allocation through restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives, thereby enhancing operational flexibility, cost mitigation and strategic agility. The July 2016 separation of Fortive, which generated approximately $3.0 billion of net cash distributions used to repay and redeem debt and fund dividends, exemplifies the company’s capacity to reconstitute organizational structures, preserve liquidity, and reallocate financial resources to support continuity of operations and shareholder returns. To mitigate interest rate, currency exchange, equity price and commodity price volatility, the company maintains a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, high-quality cash and temporary investments, short-term commercial paper programs backed by credit facilities and currency-denominated debt that partly hedges its net foreign investments. These combined practices support the preservation of positive adjustment under challenging conditions and the maintenance of system integrity and performance.

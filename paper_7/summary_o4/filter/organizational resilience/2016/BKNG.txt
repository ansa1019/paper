Throughout our operations, we proactively monitor and respond to a range of internal and external pressures to preserve operational continuity and maintain performance under challenging conditions, including economic uncertainty in the European Union and China, sovereign default risks, geopolitical tensions, currency volatility arising from events such as Brexit, and unpredictable disruptions such as pandemics, natural disasters and terrorist attacks. We deploy various risk-mitigation mechanisms, including derivative hedging instruments to minimize the impact of short-term currency fluctuations on our consolidated results, a $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and the issuance of senior notes for flexible capital access, and we maintain significant cash balances—approximately $13.9 billion as of December 31, 2016—largely held abroad and indefinitely reinvested to ensure liquidity and operational flexibility. Seasonality and merchant transaction cash-flow timing differences are managed through strategic working capital structures whereby consumer payments precede travel service provider settlements, reducing funding pressures, and we have the ability to deploy resources rapidly for strategic acquisitions such as the 2017 definitive agreement to acquire the Momondo Group. Our strategic investments in technology, marketing, brand promotion, geographic expansion, data centers and personnel—pursued even at the expense of near-term margin pressure—reflect a systemic perspective on long-term performance maintenance and adaptation, with capital deployment calibrated through rigorous forecasting, impairment testing of goodwill and intangibles, and ongoing assessment of return objectives. We engage in continuous scenario analysis to assess and provision for potential legal and tax contingencies, including travel-transaction tax exposures and permanent-establishment assessments in France, and periodically adjust our estimates for stock-based compensation, deferred tax liabilities and derivative strategies in response to evolving market conditions. This dynamic approach to resource generation, allocation and reconfiguration across our global portfolio of brands underpins our ability to absorb strain, preserve organizational integrity and maintain positive adjustment under varying environmental perturbations.

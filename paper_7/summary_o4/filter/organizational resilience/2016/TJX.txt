During fiscal 2017, management generated strong cash flows and maintained robust liquidity through internally generated funds, cash and cash equivalents and committed credit facilities, enabling continued dividends, share repurchases and strategic reinvestments in store expansion, remodels and infrastructure—including approximately $1.2 billion of planned capital expenditures for offices, distribution centers and information systems—to support business continuity, operational flexibility and growth. Risk-mitigation practices such as routine inventory-related hedging instruments were employed to absorb strain from foreign currency fluctuations, offsetting mark-to-market adjustments when inventory is received and preserving merchandise margin. The timing and amount of share repurchases, which reduced weighted average diluted shares by approximately 3% annually, were calibrated to excess cash flow, market conditions, liquidity needs and business prospects, illustrating adaptive resource allocation. The company optimized its capital structure through issuance of $1.0 billion of ten-year notes and early redemption of higher-cost debt, while offering lump-sum pension payouts to reduce future obligations, collectively reconfiguring its financial trajectories under challenging conditions. Adjustments in inventory management and accounts payable drove a $60 million increase in cash, and favorable changes in accrued liabilities bolstered operating cash flows by $536 million year-over-year. Retained earnings of foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested to preserve cash resources and mitigate tax exposure, reflecting a systemic perspective on long-term continuity. These integrated strategies and mechanisms underscore the organization’s ability to absorb external pressures, maintain financial and operational integrity and adapt to evolving market disruptions.

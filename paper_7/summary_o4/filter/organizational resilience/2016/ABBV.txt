AbbVie’s management discussion emphasizes the company’s ability to maintain operational continuity and preserve performance under external pressures through a combination of strong cash flow generation, strategic resource allocation and adaptive financing measures. In 2016, AbbVie generated $7.0 billion of operating cash flow, which it deployed to enhance its mid- and late-stage pipeline via licensing and collaboration activities, to continue dividend payments and to repurchase shares under both open-market and accelerated repurchase agreements, thereby reconfiguring its capital structure to support long-term growth. The company augmented its competitive position and mitigated risk by acquiring Stemcentrx and the rights to risankizumab, financing these transactions and the repayment of maturing debt through the issuance of $7.8 billion aggregate principal of senior notes and €3.6 billion senior euro notes, while retaining access to a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility. AbbVie’s approach to risk management includes the use of interest rate swap agreements to hedge floating-rate debt, forward contracts for anticipated cash flows and detailed credit risk monitoring of governmental receivables in economically challenged jurisdictions, with allowances for rebates, chargebacks and foreign exchange devaluation losses—most notably a $298 million loss in Venezuela—recognized to preserve system integrity. Contingent consideration liabilities arising from acquisitions are measured and revalued at fair value based on probabilities of milestone achievement and discount rates, reflecting dynamic risk assessment. The company also adjusts pension and post-employment benefit obligations by applying yield-curve spot rates to projected cash flows and periodically revises rebate and returns reserves based on channel inventory and claims experience, demonstrating operational flexibility and a systemic perspective on sustaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

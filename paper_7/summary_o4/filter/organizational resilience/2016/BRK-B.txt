We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis, with essentially no centralized or integrated business functions and minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day activities of the operating businesses, thereby supporting operational flexibility and capacity to respond to varying conditions. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of chief executives for each operating business, and is responsible for establishing and monitoring corporate governance practices, including tone at the top messages to employees and associates, monitoring governance efforts and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed, which contributes to maintaining organizational integrity under external pressures. We believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield for cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury bills, thereby preserving resources to absorb strain, mitigate risk and preserve functioning under adverse financial market conditions. Insurance underwriting operations are conducted with significant responsibility delegated to unit managers, and investment decisions, with limited exceptions, are the responsibility of Berkshire’s chairman and CEO, enabling both local autonomy and centralized oversight to adapt to market volatility and sustain performance. Management acknowledges that investment and derivative gains and losses have caused and will likely continue to cause significant volatility in periodic earnings, and we hold substantial cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury bills, reflecting a systemic perspective and resilience strategy against market disruptions. In our railroad and utilities and energy businesses, operational initiatives such as capacity added in response to substandard service, line expansion, system improvement projects and seasonal adjustments reflect adaptive strategies to confront demand variability, environmental perturbations and service disruptions. We regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business, funded by cash flow from operations and new debt issuances, to sustain functioning under extreme conditions and support future‐oriented operational continuity. Our insurance subsidiaries record and monitor unpaid loss estimates, reestimate key assumptions such as loss emergence patterns, frequency and severity and adjust liabilities accordingly, demonstrating a learning organization’s commitment to continuous adjustment and risk mitigation in the face of emerging claim trends. We have authorized share repurchases at prices no higher than a 20% premium over book value, subject to preserving consolidated cash and liquidity above a $20 billion threshold, reflecting a strategic tool for resource management and financial resilience. Across all segments, we employ decentralization, dynamic capital allocation, intensive governance monitoring, proactive liquidity management and periodic reassessment of critical assumptions as core mechanisms enabling the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

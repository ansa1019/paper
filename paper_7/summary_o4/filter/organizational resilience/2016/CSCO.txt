Cisco reports that during fiscal 2016 it operated in a challenging environment characterized by significant volatility and a highly competitive landscape, with macroeconomic uncertainty and fluctuating business momentum across customer markets, yet it believes it is well positioned and has maintained positive adjustment under these internal and external pressures. The company has pursued productivity improvements—driven by value engineering, favorable component pricing, and operational efficiencies—and balanced supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times while mitigating inventory obsolescence risk. It completed a restructuring to realign resources, made targeted headcount additions in engineering and services, and accelerated innovation and the transition of its business model toward software and subscriptions to improve long-term resilience. With strong cash, cash equivalents, and high-quality investments, Cisco continues to invest in priority areas, make acquisitions, provide customer financing, and lead customers in their digital transition by offering highly secure, automated, and intelligent solutions that support scale, security, agility, and overall business continuity.

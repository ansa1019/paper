Our business model’s industry-leading breadth of differentiated analog and embedded processing semiconductors creates diverse and long-lived positions that reduce dependence on any single product or application, enabling the company to absorb variability in demand and maintain performance by solving a wider range of customer needs. We invest more than $1 billion annually in new product development and have been shifting resources from manufacturing support and SG&A into R&D, reflecting a future orientation and capacity for innovation and adaptation. A strong foundation of in-house manufacturing technology and low-cost production—supporting billions of semiconductors per year on 150-, 200- and 300-millimeter wafers, together with the strategic acquisition of mature assets ahead of demand—ensures consistent supply, mitigates external pressures and sustains operational continuity; in 2016 we increased factory loadings by approximately 15 percent on 300-millimeter wafers, which yield a 40 percent cost advantage per chip. Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, we maintain operational flexibility by spreading fixed costs over variable output volumes, aligning profit margins with changes in demand and absorbing internal and external variations. Our ability to grow free cash flow—30.5 percent of revenue in 2016—and to draw on $3.49 billion of cash and short-term investments, together with an undrawn $2 billion revolving credit facility through March 2021, underpins our preparedness to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, debt service and other requirements for at least the next 12 months, thereby preserving liquidity and organizational health. In addition, our systematic use of allowances for inventory obsolescence and tax contingencies—based on historical data, current economic conditions and contractual terms—demonstrates risk assessment and mitigation practices that support business continuity and resilience in the face of demand shifts, technology changes and other disruptions.

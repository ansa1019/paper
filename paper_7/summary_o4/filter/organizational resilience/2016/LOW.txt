In 2016, we remained committed to our key priorities including differentiating ourselves with better customer experiences and improving our product and service offering for the pro customer, continued to enhance our omni-channel experiences by delivering convenience, inspiration, expertise, and efficiency across the most relevant moments of the customer’s project journey, and leveraged larger store formats and expertise in customer experience design to create integrated product assortments, intuitive presentation and display, and optimal service components across all selling channels. We advanced our offerings for the pro customer by improving inventory depth, national and local brand assortment, and the strength of our service delivery through our account executive ProServices teams and enhancements to the lowesforpros.com e-commerce platform, saving time and enabling more efficient customer operations. We upgraded the Lowes.com shopping experience with refined search algorithms, expanded content recommendations, improved click-to-chat capabilities, larger images, expanded product views, and video content, and built an array of tools to help customers visualize projects on digital and social channels. The national rollout of our interior and exterior project specialist program, a critical element of our omni-channel strategy, provided a differentiated capability to capture and serve customers’ interior and exterior project demand. The acquisition of RONA enabled us to accelerate our growth strategy in Canada and integrate shared supplier relationships, enhanced scale, and private-label brand capabilities while eliminating redundant public company costs. We believe net cash provided by operating and financing activities will be adequate for operating requirements, investments in existing stores and distribution facilities, information technology, expansion plans and acquisitions, and returning cash to shareholders, supported by our amended and restated credit agreement extending borrowings to November 2021, ongoing access to commercial paper and long-term debt markets, and a board-authorized share repurchase program with $5.1 billion remaining available and $3.5 billion planned repurchases in 2017, with our ratio of debt to equity plus debt at 70.8% as of February 3, 2017. Our financial and liquidity strategies, including covenant compliance, support business continuity and mitigate the risk of external rating actions. We apply critical judgments and estimates in our accounting policies and reserves for obsolete inventory and shrinkage, impairment of investments and long-lived assets, goodwill, self-insurance liabilities, and revenue recognition for extended protection plan contracts, using historical experience, current market conditions, forecasted performance, and risk assessments to preserve system integrity and performance under both nominal and exceptional conditions. We speak throughout our forward-looking statements with caution that actual results could differ substantially due to identified risk factors, underscoring our focus on preparedness, adaptability, and resilience in a dynamic business environment.

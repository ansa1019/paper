Oracle’s integrated cloud offerings are designed to be rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to innovation; easily maintainable to reduce integration and testing work; connectable among differing deployment models to enable interchangeability and extendibility between cloud and on-premise IT environments; compatible to easily move workloads between on-premise IT environments and the Oracle Cloud; cost-effective by requiring lower upfront customer investment; and secure, standards-based and reliable, thereby facilitating operational flexibility and continuity. The Company has a deep understanding of how all components within IT environments—application, platform and infrastructure—interact and function with one another and focuses development efforts on improving the performance, security, operation and integration of these differing technologies to make them more cost-effective and easier to deploy, manage and maintain, supporting resilience under varying conditions. After the initial purchase of Oracle products and services, customers can continue to take advantage of Oracle’s research and development investments and deep IT expertise by purchasing and renewing Oracle support offerings, which may include product enhancements or by renewing their SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts, maintaining service continuity and preserving functionality amidst changing requirements. As customers deploy with the Oracle Cloud, many adopt a hybrid IT model whereby certain of their IT resources are deployed and managed through the Oracle Cloud while others remain on-premise, and both sets of resources can be managed as one; Oracle engineers its products and services to connect these different deployment models to enable flexibility, ease, agility, compatibility, extensibility and seamlessness. To support efficient resource utilization, Oracle strives to reduce costs by simplifying its manufacturing processes through increased standardization of components across product types and a “build-to-order” manufacturing process in which products are generally built only after customers have placed firm orders. Oracle enables customers to evolve and transform to substantially any IT environment at whatever pace is most appropriate for them, reflecting adaptive strategies and operational continuity. A selective and active acquisition program is another important element of Oracle’s corporate strategy: by investing billions to acquire complementary companies, products, services and technologies, Oracle enhances the products and services it can offer, expands its customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows revenues and earnings, and increases stockholder value, thereby reconfiguring capabilities to respond effectively to environmental disruptions. Each of Oracle’s businesses and operating segments has unique characteristics and faces different opportunities and challenges, and Oracle presents constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how its underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, illustrating the maintenance of performance despite external disturbances. Oracle’s services business employs a global, blended delivery model to help customers align IT strategy, plan and deploy Oracle offerings, leveraging internal knowledge, inter-organizational collaboration and strategic foresight to embed resilience into clients’ architectures. Strategic resource allocation decisions—including debt issuances, dividend payments and common stock repurchases—reflect Oracle’s ongoing management of financial resources to maintain organizational health and adaptability in turbulent markets. Continuous investment in research and development and general and administrative operations supports competitive positioning, risk mitigation, and the preservation of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Finally, Oracle executes management-approved restructuring plans—comprising employee severance, facility consolidations and contract termination costs—to improve its cost structure and integrate acquired operations, demonstrating its capacity for organizational change processes and resilience strategies.

During fiscal 2015 we integrated Fotolia into our digital media segment and, subsequent to year-end, completed the TubeMogul acquisition for our digital marketing segment, reflecting a systematic approach to business combinations and the reconfiguration of resources to preserve and improve functioning under evolving conditions. We frequently expand and improve our technology to keep pace with customer and market expectations, providing enhancements and support at each stage of the customer life cycle, and we base our revenue recognition, business combinations, goodwill impairment and income tax estimates on historical experience and regularly evaluated assumptions and judgments to mitigate risks and maintain performance under varying internal and external pressures. We employ currency hedging programs to offset foreign exchange fluctuations and structured stock repurchase agreements to optimize capital allocation by repurchasing shares at guaranteed discounts when expected returns on prepayments exceed foregone investment income. Our primary liquidity derives from operating cash flows, supported by deferred and unbilled deferred revenue representing contractually committed future billings under subscription, SaaS and managed service agreements, and we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short- and long-term investments, available credit facility and projected cash flows will be sufficient to meet working capital and operating expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. We maintain a $1 billion revolving credit agreement maturing in July 2020 that remains undrawn, and we have established reserves for income taxes and indemnification obligations to address potential exposures. We continue to invest in data center infrastructure, research and development, sales and marketing capabilities and an extensive ecosystem of partners to broaden our routes to market and support long-term competitive strength, demonstrating operational flexibility, risk mitigation strategies and resource deployment to sustain business continuity and organizational health amidst pressures and uncertainties.

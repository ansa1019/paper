Stryker has maintained business continuity and operational flexibility through its capital allocation strategy prioritizing acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases, reinforcing its portfolio and adjusting resource deployment to preserve performance under external pressures. Its global cash management strategy, which takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations, together with robust operating cash flow as the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures, enables the company to absorb strain from currency fluctuations and product recall–related payments while preserving its financial condition. The company supplements operating cash flow with debt issuances and maintains appropriate debt levels, supported by strong investment-grade credit ratings and ready access to capital markets at competitive rates, thereby ensuring resilience in meeting short-term liquidity and operating requirements, including acquisitions and recall obligations. Continued investments in internal innovation, research and development, and in project spending such as its global ERP system and dedicated additive manufacturing facility, along with cost containment initiatives and focus on operating expense improvement, underpin the organization’s ability to adapt to unexpected situations, sustain organic sales growth, and respond effectively to market disruptions. Disciplined inventory management and the net of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable processes, combined with the systematic use of non-GAAP financial measures to review operating results and project future trends, further reinforce the company’s capacity to foresee and mitigate potential constraints, preserve system integrity and maintain performance even under challenging conditions.

The company maintains operational flexibility and preserves its integrity and performance under internal and external disturbances by carefully managing research and development spending across its portfolio, such that “a delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending,” by securing access to $2.87 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities to support its commercial paper program and by believing that “amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short-term borrowing needs,” by monitoring deteriorating economies and regulatory developments to assess potential charges and by managing foreign currency and interest rate exposures “through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments,” by establishing sales return, rebate and discount reserves based on historical return rates, channel inventory levels and contract terms to maintain revenue stability, by structuring milestone and royalty obligations in its collaborations so that it may terminate development and avoid contingent payments if warranted, by depending on patents and other forms of intellectual-property protection to mitigate revenue erosion and sustain competitive advantage, by regularly reviewing and adjusting its pensions and retiree health benefit assumptions to safeguard future obligations, by integrating acquired businesses with managed severance, integration costs and asset impairment reviews to preserve system resilience, and by maintaining targeted inventories with wholesalers to support business continuity and mitigate supply-chain disruptions.

KKR recognizes that external financial and economic conditions exert pressures on its operations and influence the value, realizations and deployment of investments, requiring adaptability and resource flexibility. The firm notes that periods of market volatility and dislocation present not only risks but also opportunities to invest at more favorable valuations to position for future growth, illustrating proactive resilience strategies. Credit market fluctuations and foreign exchange volatility are actively monitored and, where appropriate, hedged to mitigate adverse impacts on valuations and to create selective investment opportunities. Commodity-price variations similarly affect the value of real asset portfolios, prompting scenario analyses to preserve and enhance performance under adverse movements. KKR’s ability to generate revenue relies on its capacity to attract and deploy capital, with a long-term investment horizon and tolerance for variable quarterly activity reflecting operational flexibility and strategic foresight. Adoption of new accounting guidance, including ASU 2015-02, and adjustments to segment reporting and performance measures demonstrate the organization’s capacity to reconfigure reporting structures and maintain integrity under changing regulatory and market conditions. Liquidity and capital resources are managed through diversified sources—including operating cash flows, carried interest realizations, dividends and interest income, asset sales and credit facilities—underscoring the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions and support for ongoing investment and distribution activities. Furthermore, the firm’s use of supplemental performance measures, tax-basis optimization and capital allocation frameworks provides additional tools for risk assessment, resource management and preparedness, thereby preserving organizational health and enabling adaptation to evolving business environments.

Bank of America’s 2016 Annual Report discloses a comprehensive risk‐management and governance framework designed to maintain organizational integrity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions by integrating strategic planning, capital planning, liquidity management, credit risk oversight and operational continuity into enterprise‐wide policies, procedures and stress‐testing routines. The Board and its committees annually approve a formal risk appetite statement, capital allocation methodology and contingency funding and recovery plans, while executive management and the Management Risk Committee oversee the identification, measurement, monitoring and control of key risks across all lines of business, including credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance and reputational risks. Centralized asset‐and‐liability management and globally coordinated funding activities ensure access to diversified liquidity sources—cash, high‐quality unencumbered securities and contingent funding from the Federal Reserve and other facilities—guided by metrics such as time‐to‐required funding and a global liquidity buffer. Robust stress‐testing under adverse macroeconomic and idiosyncratic scenarios, including simulations of parallel and nonparallel interest‐rate shocks and single‐counterparty credit limits, support resilience by quantifying impacts on net interest income, capital ratios, and the liquidity coverage ratio. Credit risk management employs statistical models, internal risk ratings and portfolio segmentation to estimate incurred loss allowances, while contingency plans address repurchase obligations under mortgage representations and warranties. Operational and compliance risk programs, comprising risk and control self‐assessments, key risk indicators, scenario analyses and independent testing, reinforce business continuity, crisis response and reputational protection. Through these systemic initiatives—spanning capital buffers, regulatory compliance, governance oversight, scenario planning, and real‐time monitoring—the corporation cultivates dynamic capabilities, adaptability and sustained performance in a turbulent market environment.

ADP’s MD&A describes a multifaceted approach to maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions through its focus on product innovation, distribution and service enhancement, and regulatory complexity management, noting that “fiscal 2016 was another exciting and dynamic year that showcased our agility as we continued to adapt to the evolving needs of our clients and the changing regulatory environment … as evidenced by our ability to respond to the challenges presented by the ACA.” The company underscores its operational flexibility by highlighting “our sales force’s ability to sell to new and existing clients as well as our implementation team’s ability to implement new clients on our solutions and implement new services to existing clients,” and by launching a multi-year service alignment initiative “intended to align our client service operations with our platform simplification strategy.” It reports a “strong business model with …the ability to generate consistent, healthy cash flows, strong client retention, and low capital expenditure requirements,” sustained by a solid balance sheet with approximately $3.2 billion in cash and marketable securities and the “introduction of long-term debt … intended to enhance total shareholder return over the longer term.” Investments in systems development and programming—“to develop, support, and maintain our products”—and increased selling, general and administrative expenses to “support our growth in new business bookings,” including ACA-compliance solutions, reflect strategic resource allocation and risk mitigation. The report acknowledges a decline in revenue retention due to “elevated losses on our legacy client platforms” and describes upgrading clients to modern cloud solutions to improve the client experience. Liquidity and crisis management mechanisms include a $9.25 billion commercial paper program, reverse repurchase agreements, committed credit facilities, and an investment strategy that “averages our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments,” with defined credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits to manage interest rate and credit risk. ADP also manages its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations “through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.” The PEO services segment utilizes “historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability” and enters reinsurance arrangements to “cover substantially all losses,” while impounding client funds “in advance of the timing of payment” to minimize liquidity and default risks. Strategic debt and capital structure decisions—such as the issuance of $2 billion of senior unsecured notes, staggered credit facility maturities, and access to both short- and long-term financing—demonstrate proactive measures, strategic foresight, and adaptive capacity to maintain system integrity and performance under varied internal and external disturbances.

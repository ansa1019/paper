Nike’s management discussion emphasizes the company’s maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions through a system of operational flexibility and risk mitigation, including investments to reduce product costs via manufacturing efficiency, product design and innovation, and to make the supply chain a competitive advantage by increasing automation, reducing waste and enhancing speed to market and customization; infrastructure investments that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operations; disciplined inventory management with warehousing efficiencies and obsolescence reserves; ordering product four to five months in advance based on futures orders to anticipate customer needs; and a centralized foreign exchange risk management program that uses standard foreign currency rates, forward contracts and options to hedge transactional exposures, non-functional currency sales and translational impacts. The company’s strategic orientation toward long-term, sustainable revenue growth and shareholder value is supported by deployment of capital to high-margin direct-to-consumer operations, consumer engagement investments in digital brand marketing and retail brand presentation, and management of working capital efficiency and credit facilities to preserve performance under significant foreign currency headwinds, volatile markets and supply-chain disruptions. These systemic initiatives, from demand creation through digital platforms and sports marketing endorsements to the use of committed credit lines, commercial paper programs and shelf registrations, reflect the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity, thereby sustaining integrity, performance maintenance and resilience in the face of internal and external variations.

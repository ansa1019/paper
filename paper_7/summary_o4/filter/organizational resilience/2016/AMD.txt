In 2016, AMD continued to closely manage our operating expenses and to improve our balance sheet by reducing our debt and extending our debt maturities, issuing $690 million of common stock and $805 million aggregate principal amount of 2.125% convertible senior notes, using the net proceeds to repay $230 million under our secured revolving line of credit and repurchase $796 million of higher-coupon debt, which lowered total debt to $1.4 billion from $2.2 billion and increased cash and cash equivalents to $1.3 billion from $785 million. We executed our roadmap by delivering new processors, GPUs and semi-custom SoC products, demonstrating operational flexibility and innovation in response to market dynamics. The sixth amendment to our wafer supply agreement established a comprehensive technology collaboration framework and provided a limited waiver and rights to contract with another wafer foundry for greater flexibility in sourcing services across our product portfolio. We implemented restructuring plans to simplify our business and better align resources, reducing global headcount by approximately 5% and aligning our real estate footprint, completed the strategic exit of the dense server systems business, and formed joint ventures to monetize intellectual property and support expansion in China, thereby reconfiguring our organizational structure. In addition, we regularly evaluate ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence based on projected demand, adjust reserves for sales returns and allowances, and employ cash flow and covenant management, including amendments to our loan agreements to permit supply chain finance arrangements, ensuring sufficient liquidity and demonstrating our ability to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning and maintain performance under challenging internal and external conditions.

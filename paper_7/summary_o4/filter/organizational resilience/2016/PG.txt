Procter & Gamble’s MD&A outlines a multi-year strategic productivity and cost-savings initiative “to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads,” under which “we strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization,” with resulting “productivity improvements being reinvested in product and packaging improvements, brand awareness-building advertising and trial-building sampling programs, increased sales coverage and R&D programs.” The company further reports that “we are improving operational effectiveness and organizational culture through enhanced clarity of roles and responsibilities, accountability and incentive compensation programs,” while its global operating model—comprising global business units, selling and market operations, global business services and corporate functions—provides “technology, processes and standard data tools to enable the GBUs and the SMOs to better understand the business and better serve consumers and customers” and delivers “company-level strategy and portfolio analysis, corporate accounting, treasury, tax, external relations, governance, human resources and legal, as well as other centralized functional support.” To mitigate volatility from commodity prices, foreign exchange and government policy changes, P&G states “we manage commodity fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions as well as through consistent productivity improvements” and that it “maintain[s] debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans and the overall cost of capital,” supported by undrawn bank credit facilities “that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements.” In response to exceptional conditions in Venezuela, the company “deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries” due to loss of exchangeability and adopted the cost method, effecting a write-off of net assets and preserving financial integrity under currency and operational constraints. Throughout, forward-looking statements concerning “our business plans, objectives and expected operating results” underscore P&G’s systemic, forward-oriented approach to sustaining integrity and performance under challenging and uncertain conditions.

Amgen has undertaken significant transformation and process-improvement initiatives to establish a more agile and efficient operating model, reconfiguring resource allocation to fund product launches, clinical programs and external business development, thereby realizing approximately $1.2 billion in cumulative savings since 2014 and incurring restructuring charges of $709 million to date; these efforts enable the company to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning under evolving external pressures and maintain operational continuity. The company has also invested in external early-stage innovation alongside internal research, advanced next-generation biomanufacturing to reduce cost and scale while ensuring reliable, high-quality supply, and innovated patient-friendly delivery systems to differentiate offerings. Management’s forward-looking statements underscore an ongoing commitment to adapt to competitive challenges—such as biosimilar competition, pricing pressures, regulatory scrutiny and demand fluctuations—through strategic planning, dynamic capital deployment and liquidity management, including a $2.5 billion commercial paper program, a multi-year revolving credit facility and interest-rate and cross-currency hedges to mitigate financial risk. Cash flows from operating activities increased 6% to $10.4 billion in 2016, enabling sustained dividends, share repurchases and reinvestment for long-term growth while preserving financial flexibility. Robust inventory monitoring, rigorous assessment of legal contingencies and periodic reviews of asset carrying values for impairment further reflect Amgen’s capacity to foresee, confront and adapt to nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions and sustain integrity and performance across its global operations.

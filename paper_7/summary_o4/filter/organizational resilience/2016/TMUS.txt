Our MD&A describes the introduction in 2013 of our un-carrier strategy “with the objective of eliminating customer pain points from the unnecessary complexity of the wireless communication industry,” and details additional un-carrier initiatives—such as the history-making #getthanked program and the JUMP! on demand device-leasing program—that have enhanced our operational flexibility, customer responsiveness and resource reconfiguration. We report that service and equipment revenues increased primarily due to strong customer response to these strategic initiatives and continued growth in new markets, underscoring our ability to adapt and maintain performance under evolving conditions. The September 2016 MVNO transaction, which transferred 1,365,000 branded postpaid and 326,000 branded prepaid customers to wholesale, “resulted in improvements to branded postpaid phone churn,” illustrating our capacity to reconstitute customer relationships for improved functioning. A handset OEM recall led us to “record no revenue associated with the device sales,” impair the devices to net realizable value and secure reimbursement for direct and indirect recall costs, demonstrating risk mitigation, crisis management and preservation of financial integrity. We further detail network expansion to utilize our 700 MHz A-block spectrum licenses, partially offset by “synergies realized from the decommissioning of the MetroPCS CDMA network,” reflecting deliberate resource allocation and reconfiguration to strengthen our network’s resilience. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased “primarily from strategic investments to support our growing customer base,” including higher commissions, additional depreciation on leased devices and continued 4G LTE build-out to sustain service continuity. Liquidity disclosures highlight that net cash provided by operating activities increased 13% to $6.1 billion and free cash flow rose 108% to $1.4 billion, supported by receivables sales arrangements and credit facilities to ensure business continuity. We anticipate $4.8 billion to $5.1 billion of property and equipment expenditures in 2017, excluding potential spectrum auction purchases, and outline scenario planning for associated debt financing. In our critical accounting policies we maintain allowances for credit losses, perform periodic depreciable-life studies and conduct annual impairment assessments of goodwill and spectrum licenses—using qualitative screening and a greenfield income approach—to preserve asset integrity under fluctuating market conditions. Under JUMP!, we estimate a guarantee liability “based on various economic and customer behavioral assumptions” and adjust those assumptions periodically, exemplifying our dynamic forecasting, risk management and absorptive capacity. These disclosures collectively illustrate our multifaceted approach to absorb strain, adapt to external disturbances and preserve or improve operational performance and organizational integrity amidst competitive pressures and unexpected events.

S&P Global has repositioned itself as a more focused company in the capital and commodity markets by exiting non-core assets and investing for growth in scalable, industry-leading, interrelated businesses, realigning its reportable segments to reflect changes in organizational structure and how the chief executive officer evaluates performance, and streamlining its infrastructure through reducing its real estate footprint and consolidating its headquarters. The company maintains a strong financial position, generating cash from its core operations, preserving liquidity through cash on hand, robust cash flows from operations and availability under a committed credit facility with covenants that have not been exceeded, and deploying free cash flow to strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends, debt repayment and infrastructure investment. In response to evolving market and regulatory pressures, S&P Global has reviewed and implemented necessary changes under new accounting and regulatory standards, continuously monitors and updates its credit ratings through surveillance and research, and provides transparent benchmarks, analytics and data to support decision making, risk assessment and mitigation strategies for its customers. During the period, the company completed significant portfolio reconfigurations—including acquisitions of SNL, PIRA Energy Group and RigData to enhance analytical capabilities and market position, and dispositions of J.D. Power, SPSE, CMA and Equity Research to focus resources—which reflect its ability to reconstitute and reconfigure resources toward its strategic objectives. The firm has emphasized operational excellence, accelerated digital transformation, stimulated innovation and enhanced leadership and accountability, while acknowledging that prolonged credit market difficulties or regulatory changes could unfavorably impact results. These measures demonstrate S&P Global’s capability to absorb strain, preserve or improve functionality and maintain performance under internal and external variations, adapt to disruptions, and allocate resources effectively to ensure continuity, resilience and sustained competitive advantage in a volatile business environment.

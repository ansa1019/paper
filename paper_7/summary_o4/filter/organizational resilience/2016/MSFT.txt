Much of our focus in fiscal year 2016 was toward transforming our organization to support our mobile-first, cloud-first strategy, as we achieved product development milestones, implemented organizational changes and made strategic and tactical moves to support our central ambitions, demonstrating our capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning under challenging conditions. We announced plans to restructure our phone business to better focus and align resources and further streamline our smartphone hardware business, reinforcing our strategy and illustrating operational flexibility and resource reconfiguration in response to market disruptions. Recognizing that our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, we must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment, pushing the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers, industry trends, and competitive forces, thereby maintaining integrity and performance amid external perturbations. Our strategic acquisition agreement to acquire LinkedIn, financed through the issuance of new indebtedness, and the sale of our entry-level feature phone business further exemplify mechanisms to reconstitute our organizational trajectory toward future growth. We employ derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit, and provide indemnifications against third-party intellectual property infringement and cloud security commitments, reflecting systemic risk mitigation and preparedness. Liquidity management, supported by substantial cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held by domestic and foreign subsidiaries, together with access to capital markets and debt issuance capabilities, ensures we have the financial resources to fund operating activities, capital expenditures, dividends, and debt maturities for the foreseeable future without impairing performance. We recorded impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses related to our phone business and consolidation of facilities, reflecting adjustments to our cost structure, while continuing to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, datacenters, and technology acquisitions to drive cloud innovation and capacity. The change in organizational structure to align segments with our strategic direction and the revised information for resource allocation and performance assessment highlight our systemic perspective and agility in reconfiguring internal processes. Our critical accounting policies, including the deferral of net revenue from Windows 10 of $6.6 billion and quarterly evaluation of other-than-temporary impairments, underpin our resilience engineering through prudent recognition and measurement practices that maintain the integrity of our financial reporting under varying conditions, reinforcing our ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions and emerge stronger from disruptive change.

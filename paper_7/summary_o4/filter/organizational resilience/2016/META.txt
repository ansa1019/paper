In our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we acknowledge that actual results could differ materially from forward-looking statements, reflecting the potential impact of external pressures, uncertainties and risk factors on our operations. We continue to invest based on our strategic roadmap—focusing on our core Facebook app and platform, video, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp ecosystems and pursuing long-term technology initiatives such as virtual reality and artificial intelligence—to drive growth, build capacity and sustain performance under rapidly evolving conditions. We anticipate significant expense growth in 2017 as we hire top engineering, technical, marketing and sales talent, invest in research and development, expand data center capacity, network infrastructure and office facilities, and enhance our operational teams to support increased user engagement and the delivery of new products and services. We believe that presenting revenue on a constant-currency basis and other non-GAAP measures provides transparency for assessing performance independent of currency fluctuations. As of December 31, 2016, we held $29.45 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and maintain a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, which, together with robust cash flow from operations, we expect will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future. We have adopted a net share settlement approach for employee equity award withholding taxes to optimize cash flow and manage share dilution. We apply critical accounting policies and estimates on an ongoing basis—recognizing provisions for probable and estimable liabilities, reviewing goodwill and intangible asset recoverability, and accruing unrecognized tax benefits—while disclosing contractual obligations for operating leases, finance commitments and capital expenditures without off-balance sheet arrangements and routinely adjusting reserves for legal and tax contingencies. These strategic investments, resource allocations, financial provisions and contingency planning collectively support our ability to absorb strain, maintain system integrity and preserve or improve functioning under internal or external variations and disturbances.

In response to mixed and challenging economic conditions, including uneven global growth, currency fluctuations and shifting trade patterns, the Company adapted its organizational structure and resources by adjusting air capacity and cost structure, leveraging flexibilities inherent in its transportation network and expanding operating facilities to improve time-in-transit performance. It has deployed technology improvements—such as facility automation and the on-road integrated optimization and navigation system (“ORION”)—to increase network capacity, operational efficiency, flexibility and reliability, pursue yield management and contain costs across all segments. By dynamically matching air and ground networks to prevailing volume levels, optimizing delivery density on vehicles, restraining growth in aircraft block hours through network modifications and reallocating resources via disciplined revenue management initiatives, the Company has absorbed strain, preserved functioning under external pressures, managed risks and sustained performance maintenance. These measures support business continuity under adverse or variable conditions and reflect a systemic, adaptive approach that reinforces competitive advantage, operational flexibility and the capacity to emerge stronger through disruptive change.

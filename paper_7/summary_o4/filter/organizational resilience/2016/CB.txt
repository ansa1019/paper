Effective the first quarter of 2016, reflecting significantly larger and expanded operations subsequent to the Chubb Corp acquisition, the company implemented organizational changes that resulted in new business segments; it now operates through six segments—North America commercial P&C insurance, North America personal P&C insurance, North America agricultural insurance, overseas general insurance, global reinsurance and life insurance—while redefining its corporate segment to include all run-off asbestos and environmental exposures, the results of run-off Brandywine business and Westchester specialty operations for years prior to 1996 and certain other run-off exposures, and adjusted prior period amounts to conform to the new segment presentation.

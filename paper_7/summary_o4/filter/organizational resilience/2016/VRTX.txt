We closely monitor the results of our discovery, research, clinical trials and nonclinical studies and frequently evaluate our drug development programs in light of new data and scientific, business and commercial insights, with the objective of balancing risk and potential, noting that this process can result in abrupt changes in focus and priorities as new information becomes available and as we gain additional understanding of our ongoing programs and those of our competitors. We believe that pursuing research in diverse areas allows us to balance the risks inherent in drug development and may provide drug candidates that will form our pipeline in future years, thereby mitigating the impact of external disturbances on our organizational performance. Our corporate compliance program is designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems and through the promotion of a culture of compliance, supporting our ability to adapt to regulatory pressures and sustain operational integrity. We have entered into collaboration agreements with multiple biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in order to acquire rights or to license drug candidates or technologies that enhance our pipeline and research capabilities, diversifying our resource base and enabling quicker adaptation to disruptions in our development programs. To support business continuity and provide operational flexibility under changing market conditions, we intend to rely on existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash flows from product sales as our primary source of liquidity, while maintaining a $500.0 million revolving credit facility that may be repaid and reborrowed without penalty and increased by up to $300.0 million subject to conditions, thereby preserving access to financial resources in the event of unexpected funding needs. We also review and adjust our estimates of rebates, chargebacks, discounts, product returns and other allowances based on evolving information to ensure accurate revenue recognition and maintain performance under pressure. Our process for assessing impairment of intangible assets and contingent payment liabilities involves probability-weighted present-value models that are reviewed on an annual and interim basis in response to clinical data or market developments, reflecting our systemic perspective on risk assessment, resource allocation and resilience strategies. As of December 31, 2016, we expect that cash flows from orkambi and kalydeco, together with our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months, indicating our preparedness and proactive measures to preserve functioning in extreme or exceptional conditions.

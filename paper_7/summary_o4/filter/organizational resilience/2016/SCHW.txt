In September 2016, the OCC issued final guidelines requiring Schwab Bank to develop and maintain a recovery plan describing how it will restore itself to financial health and viability in response to a wide range of external and internal financial and operational stress scenarios, with completion required by the end of 2017; to minimize business interruptions, the company maintains a backup and recovery infrastructure—including backup facilities, a geographically dispersed workforce, and routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans—and has implemented an information security program that integrates complementary tools, controls, and monitoring systems, restricts access to sensitive data, and collaborates with government agencies to deter unauthorized access and cyber threats. Operational risks arising from failed processes, people, systems, or external events are managed through a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework approved by the Board and overseen by a global risk committee and functional sub-committees (asset-liability management and pricing, compliance risk, credit and market risk, new products and services risk oversight, and operational risk oversight), supported by policies and procedures for risk identification, assessment, measurement, monitoring, and mitigation. The company conducts regular liquidity and capital stress testing, maintains a buffer of highly liquid assets, complies with the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, and utilizes committed and uncommitted credit lines, federal and FHLB borrowing arrangements, and contingency funding scenarios to ensure sufficient liquidity under both normal and stressed conditions. Periodic capital stress testing, a capital contingency plan, and adherence to regulatory Tier 1 leverage and risk-based capital requirements further ensure the company’s solvency and support its ability to absorb strain, reconfigure its trajectory, and preserve or improve functioning under internal or external pressures, consistent with maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

Tesla’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis describes multiple organizational initiatives and capabilities that support “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions,” including the acquisition of SolarCity and Grohmann Engineering to expand production automation and mitigate supply chain constraints; the reclassification of historic revenue streams to improve the predictability of cash flows; a 64 percent year-over-year increase in vehicle production achieved despite part shortages; targeted cost reductions through economies of scale, material cost actions and improved manufacturing efficiencies; enhanced product reliability that reduced warranty expense; over-the-air software updates to maintain system integrity; and the worldwide expansion of retail, service and supercharger infrastructure to preserve operational continuity amid rapid growth and environmental perturbations. The company has committed $2.0–$2.5 billion in capital expenditures ahead of Model 3 production, is developing Gigafactory 1 and Gigafactory 2 facilities with secured Panasonic partnerships to ensure battery and module supply, and maintains senior secured credit facilities and a warehouse agreement to underwrite its direct leasing programs and support liquidity. Management acknowledges the inherent risk of cost overruns or delays in large-scale undertakings, liquidity exposure from resale value guarantees and residual value risk, and challenges in less-experienced international markets, and addresses these through ongoing evaluation of capital needs, diversified financing sources, robust working capital management and systematic judgment in critical accounting policies—ranging from revenue recognition and inventory valuation to deferred tax asset assessments—to absorb internal and external disturbances and preserve organizational functioning.

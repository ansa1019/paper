We monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis, assessing opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues, and as a result have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years that we expect will yield annual cost savings of approximately $12.3 million and be used to make additional investments to drive future revenue growth. We maintain liquidity through $4.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments diversified among high credit quality counterparties, continually monitoring credit exposure to minimize risk, and we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and dividend payments for at least the next twelve months. In connection with our proposed acquisition, we obtained fully underwritten bridge financing commitments and amended our revolving credit facility to allow for up to $1.0 billion of borrowings, and we issued senior unsecured notes while maintaining compliance with covenants and consolidated leverage ratio requirements. We defer revenue and related cost of sales on shipments to distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers, which mitigates the uncertainty of price-adjustment credits and return rights and aligns revenue recognition with end-customer demand, and we value inventories at the lower of cost (FIFO) or market, writing down for obsolescence and demand variation. We track days sales outstanding and days cost of sales in inventory to balance production, demand and inventory levels, and we record allowances for doubtful accounts based on historical experience to address potential credit losses. We allocate resources to hundreds of R&D projects, believing continued commitment to innovative technologies and processes is essential to maintain product leadership and adaptability. We review property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing carrying values to estimated future undiscounted cash flows and test goodwill for impairment using income and market approaches. We strategically manage our tax provision by leveraging lower statutory rates in foreign jurisdictions, evaluating uncertain tax positions quarterly, and we recognize settlement charges for pension plan changes and special charges for severance, lease obligations and asset impairments as part of our risk mitigation and resource reconfiguration strategies. We also operate a common stock repurchase program, which has been temporarily suspended to prioritize strategic financing for acquisitions. These combined measures reinforce our capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under internal and external variations and disturbances.

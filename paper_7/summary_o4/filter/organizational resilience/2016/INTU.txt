Our management articulates a multifaceted approach to sustaining performance under dynamic and often adverse conditions by allocating significant resources to product development, marketing, and sales capabilities aimed at embracing disruptive technology trends and entering new markets; by transitioning to connected services and ensuring the ongoing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems in collaboration with external service providers; by proactively mitigating cyber-fraud risks through enhanced security measures, inter-governmental information sharing, and continuous investment in privacy and security infrastructure; by leveraging cash flows, investments, term-loan borrowings and revolving credit commitments to maintain liquidity, meet seasonal working capital demands, support capital expenditures and meet contractual obligations; by deploying cash to strategic acquisitions (such as the integration of Check Inc.) and disciplined divestitures of noncore businesses while reclassifying and reconfiguring assets to preserve financial flexibility; by exercising judgment and performing ongoing assessments in critical accounting estimates—including revenue recognition for multi-element arrangements, impairment testing of goodwill and intangibles, and evaluation of uncertain tax positions—to uphold integrity in financial reporting; and by maintaining dividend and stock repurchase programs that enable resource reallocation in support of our operating continuity, risk management and long-term growth objectives.

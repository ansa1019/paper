While acknowledging that sales comparisons are influenced by factors beyond its control, such as fluctuations in currency exchange rates and rapid changes in gasoline prices, the Company believes that it has been successful historically in adapting its business to these changes through adjustments to pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of private‐label items, and by leveraging its membership fee model to reinforce member loyalty with renewal rates of approximately 90% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% worldwide. The Company maintains operational continuity and mitigates risk by controlling costs—particularly through ongoing investments in information‐systems modernization, maintaining employee compensation above industry averages to reduce turnover, and accelerating vendor payments in advance of system implementations—while expanding warehouse square footage and online capabilities in domestic and international markets to ensure resource availability and competitive advantage. Liquidity and capital resources are managed via operating cash flows, cash and short-term investments and bank credit facilities with unutilized capacity, enabling funding for warehouse expansion, remodeling activities, modernization projects and scheduled debt repayments. Furthermore, management’s application of LIFO inventory valuation, deferred revenue recognition for membership fees and actuarial estimates for self-insurance liabilities underscores its capacity to preserve financial integrity and adapt reporting processes under varying operational and market conditions.

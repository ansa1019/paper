Boeing conducts operations in many countries and relies on an extensive network of international partners, key suppliers and subcontractors to support business continuity and absorb strain under adverse conditions. Its strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses—Commercial Airplanes and Defense, Space & Security—supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital, generating substantial earnings and cash flow that permit investment in new products and services. Commercial Airplanes is committed to offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, efficiency and value to customers around the world and continually finds new ways to improve efficiency and quality, while BDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security, space and services to deliver capability-driven solutions at reduced costs. This approach leverages core businesses to capture key next-generation programs and expands presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity and the recognition that the cyclicality of commercial and defense markets sometimes offset. The company continually monitors external pressures—including political unrest involving Russia and Ukraine, fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, terrorism, natural disasters and evolving environmental regulations—and works with customers to mitigate risks, such as assisting with alternative third-party financing sources when Export-Import Bank support is constrained. Complex development programs like the KC-46A tanker and new commercial derivatives involve highly complex designs and systems integration and are managed through rigorous contract and program accounting processes that include quarterly reviews of estimated costs and revenues, cumulative catch-up adjustments and reach-forward loss provisions to ensure timely recognition of potential impairments. Resource resilience is further underpinned by substantial borrowing capacity, a commercial paper program for backup liquidity, compliance with debt covenants, ongoing cost-reduction efforts, industrial participation agreements to facilitate technology transfer and supply-chain adaptability, and pension funding strategies designed to maintain financial flexibility and mitigate future contribution requirements.

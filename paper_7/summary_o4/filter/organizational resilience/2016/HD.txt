Since the data breach discovered in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we have recorded $198 million of pretax net expenses related to the breach and implemented remediation measures (see Note 13), demonstrating our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adverse conditions. In fiscal 2016 we continued to invest in interconnected capabilities—including full deployment of our omni-channel order management platform in all U.S. stores, rollout of our BOPIS, BOSS and BODFS programs and a dynamic ETA feature for online orders—to adapt our service delivery, meet evolving customer needs, improve fulfillment options and enhance end-to-end customer experience, thereby reflecting operational flexibility, resource reconfiguration and service innovation. Our multi-year supply-chain optimization initiative, Project Sync, was extended to all U.S. stores to reduce supplier-to-shelf lead times, lower transportation expenses and improve inventory turns, creating an end-to-end solution that aligns suppliers, transportation providers, RDCs, store associates and customers and supports system integrity under varying pressures. Despite a $549 million headwind from a strengthening U.S. dollar, we leveraged expense controls and positive comparable store sales to achieve operating expense leverage and maintain our gross profit margin at 34.2%, underscoring our capacity to maintain performance under external perturbations. We generated $9.8 billion of cash flow from operations and, together with $5.0 billion of long-term debt and $360 million of short-term borrowings, funded the repayment of $3.0 billion of maturing debt, $6.9 billion for share repurchases, $3.4 billion in dividends and $1.6 billion in capital expenditures; in February 2017 our board authorized a new $15.0 billion share repurchase program and increased our quarterly dividend by 29%, reflecting disciplined capital allocation, financial resilience and strategic agility. We maintain access to a $2.0 billion commercial paper program backed by a committed credit facility, employ interest rate swaps to manage our fixed/floating debt mix and monitor our capital and operating lease obligations to ensure liquidity and operational continuity, thereby reinforcing our ability to respond effectively to disruptions and emerge stronger from challenging situations.

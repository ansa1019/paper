UnitedHealth Group continually forecasts and manages its cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet its short-term and long-term obligations while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. The company leverages core competencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data; information and intelligence; and clinical care management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system. In response to evolving market, regulatory and competitive pressures, UnitedHealth frequently evaluates and adjusts its pricing approach in each local market—considering product positioning, price competitiveness and legislative, regulatory and environmental factors—with a focus on balancing growth and profitability across all dimensions, and expects broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes. Through its delivery system and payment modernization initiatives, UnitedHealth collaborates with clinicians and care providers to close gaps in care, improve quality and reduce costs by leveraging data and analytics, rewarding high-quality, affordable care and fostering collaboration under full-risk, shared-risk and bundled payment models, with contract spending totaling nearly $53 billion as of December 31, 2016. The company uses cash flows from regulated and non-regulated subsidiaries, together with financing through commercial paper and committed credit facilities, to expand through acquisitions, reinvest via capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to shareholders, while maintaining a debt-to-debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of approximately 44% against a covenant threshold of 55%. UnitedHealth periodically accesses capital markets to issue long-term debt for working capital, refinancing, acquisitions or share repurchases and cautions that adverse market conditions or credit downgrades could increase borrowing costs or limit access to capital. The company continually monitors the fair value of its available-for-sale investments and performs other-than-temporary impairment assessments based on intent to hold or sell, issuer financial condition and market dynamics, and completed its annual goodwill impairment tests as of October 1, 2016, with fair values substantially in excess of carrying values for all reporting units. UnitedHealth recognizes premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive services, with Medicare Advantage and Part D revenues subject to periodic CMS risk adjustments and corresponding estimates that may produce favorable or unfavorable adjustments to premium revenue and profitability. The company’s medical costs payable estimates reflect actuarial analyses of completion factors and per-member-per-month trend factors, yielding favorable development of $220 million in 2016, illustrating its mechanisms to absorb strain and preserve performance under uncertain claim-lag conditions.

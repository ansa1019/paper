Management’s “performance with purpose” strategy embeds sustainability and organizational health into our core objectives, integrating resource efficiency initiatives such as water conservation, energy efficiency, local sourcing and packaging reduction to streamline costs, reinforce environmental stewardship and preserve business continuity amid climate change and water scarcity. We have delivered over $1 billion in annual savings through productivity agendas that include manufacturing automation, shared services expansion, simplified organizational structures and leaner cost frameworks, while investing in skills upgrading and job retraining to build workforce adaptability and operational flexibility in the face of geopolitical uncertainty. Our integrated risk management framework—overseen by the board of directors and its committees, executed by the cross-functional PepsiCo Risk Committee and supported by dedicated risk management and audit functions—systematically identifies, assesses, prioritizes, mitigates, monitors and communicates strategic, financial, operational, compliance, safety, reputational and environmental risks, deploying hedging programs for commodity, foreign exchange and interest-rate exposures and fixed-price contracts to stabilize supply-chain costs. In response to evolving consumer and regulatory pressures, we continue to reconfigure our portfolio toward “good-for-you” products through both organic innovation and strategic mergers and acquisitions, demonstrating our capacity to absorb strain and maintain performance under disruptive external conditions. We sustain robust liquidity and capital resources—with strong operating cash flows, revolving credit facilities, commercial paper programs and long-term debt issuances—enabling dividend distributions, share repurchases and disciplined capital allocation, thereby preserving financial resilience. Our collaborative engagement with retail partners, authorized bottlers and contract manufacturers, coupled with governance over vendor and joint-venture relationships, further strengthens our systemic capacity to foresee, confront, recover from and benefit amid sudden disruptive change, ensuring the maintenance of positive adjustment and long-term sustainable growth.

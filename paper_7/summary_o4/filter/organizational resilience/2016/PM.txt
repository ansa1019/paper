In management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, the company highlights its management of the business in four segments and sales in more than 180 markets, maintaining number one or two market share positions, supported by a portfolio comprising international and local premium, mid‐price and low‐price brands and a range of reduced‐risk products (“RRPs”) in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization, which present lower quantities of harmful compounds than cigarette smoke. Net revenues and operating income are affected by product volume, price, currency exchange rate changes and product and geographic mix, reflecting the firm’s operational flexibility in resource deployment. Mix, defined as the proportionate value of premium‐price to mid‐price or low‐price brands or more profitable versus less profitable geographic shipment volume, along with the classification of net revenues to include collected excise taxes, underscores the company’s systematic resource reconfiguration for performance maintenance. Cost of sales, principally comprising tobacco leaf, non‐tobacco raw materials, labor and manufacturing costs, and marketing, administration and research costs, including costs to develop new products, illustrate the allocation of resources toward innovation, risk mitigation and strategic initiatives. As a holding company, principal sources of funds are dividends and debt repayments from subsidiaries not limited by long‐term debt in their ability to pay cash dividends or distributions, evidencing financial flexibility and resource generation capacity. The company recorded pre‐tax asset impairment and exit costs of $68 million in 2015 related to severance costs for organizational restructuring in the European Union segment, with no EPS impact in 2016, indicating adaptive organizational change processes. The unfavorable currency impact from strengthening of the U.S. dollar, especially against various currencies, has impacted profitability across primary revenue markets and local currency cost bases, reflecting exposure to external disturbances and the need for currency risk management. Interest results benefitted from lower effective interest rates on debt and higher interest income. Segment operations achieved increased diluted EPS driven by higher pricing and lower marketing, administration and research costs, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix. The 2017 forecast, excluding the impact of any future acquisitions, unanticipated asset impairment and exit cost charges, future currency exchange rate changes and unusual events, anticipates net revenue growth in excess of current annual growth targets, while acknowledging continuing risks, thereby demonstrating strategic foresight, future orientation and resilience strategies in financial planning and risk assessment.

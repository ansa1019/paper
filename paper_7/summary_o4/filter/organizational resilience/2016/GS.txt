During the challenging first half of 2016, the firm completed an efficiency initiative that reduced annual run-rate compensation by approximately $900 million and generated net savings of $500 million after severance and related costs, illustrating its capacity to adapt resource allocation and preserve functioning in a low-revenue environment. The management of The Goldman Sachs Group maintains a sufficiently liquid balance sheet, dynamically managing the size and composition of assets and liabilities through balance-sheet planning, business-specific limits, scenario analyses and routine monitoring of key metrics, to ensure operational continuity under stress. A formal contingency funding plan outlines triggers, mitigants and communication procedures for perceived or actual capital deficiencies, identifying drivers of stress, prescribing mitigants and assigning responsibilities for timely internal and external information sharing. The firm holds global core liquid assets in unencumbered, highly liquid securities and certain overnight cash deposits, across principal banking and broker-dealer subsidiaries, to pre-fund potential contractual and contingent cash and collateral outflows over a 30-day severely stressed scenario, thereby preserving payment and settlement operations even when secured financing and unsecured funding markets are constrained. Long-term stress tests, including internally developed severely adverse scenarios and comprehensive capital analyses under CCAR and DFAST, measure the firmâ€™s ability to maintain capital and liquidity while continuing to serve client needs and support core businesses through market shocks, with strategic tools such as firmwide and subsidiary recovery plans, modeling of sovereign and counterparty downgrades and back-testing of Value-at-Risk, all underpinned by a governance framework involving the board, senior management and independent control functions. Robust market risk management diversifies exposures, controls position sizes, establishes hedges and employs real-time fair-value measurements, daily reporting of VAR at multiple levels and a suite of stress and scenario tests to manage interest-rate, equity price, currency and commodity risks. Credit risk management relies on annual counterparty reviews, internal credit ratings, multi-level limits, netting and collateral arrangements to absorb credit strains, while operational risk management incorporates firmwide policies, self-assessments, incident reporting, loss data capture and independent audits to prevent and recover from internal process failures, system disruptions and external events. This multifaceted and systemic approach to risk assessment, resource generation and redeployment, strategic agility, learning from market perturbations and ongoing validation of models and processes demonstrates organizational resilience as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions and the capacity to preserve or restore functioning in the face of internal or external variability and disruptions.

We employ foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a percentage of our foreign currency exposure, record product sales net of estimated mandatory and supplemental discounts through allowances based on products sold, historical utilization rates, third-party industry information, estimated patient populations and channel inventory data, and recognize revenue only when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured, reflecting a robust information processing and management capability. We manage R&D investments by identifying anticipated activities, prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources and other considerations, and we continually review our pipeline and reallocate resources among our R&D portfolio to support future growth. Our financial and strategic decision-making relies on projections of operating cash flows, assessments of capital requirements for clinical trials performed by contract research organizations, timing and probability of regulatory approvals and the continuously updated evaluation of key metrics such as gross-to-net deductions, cost of goods sold and working capital, which inform our partnering, acquisition, financing and capital return programs. These interrelated processes demonstrate our competence in mobilizing, deploying and reconfiguring financial, human and data resources, coordinating internal processes and interfirm transactions to support and enhance our business strategies and operational flexibility.

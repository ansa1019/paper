Booking Holdings emphasizes the role of its digital platforms and technology infrastructure in supporting its global online travel and restaurant reservation services by continually investing in technology and personnel to provide “platforms, tools and insights” that make it easy for people to find, book and experience their travel desires and to help partners be successful. The company attributes growth to the continued innovation and execution by its teams to add accommodations, increase and improve content, build distribution and improve the consumer experience on its websites and mobile apps, acknowledging a significant shift of business to mobile platforms and changing consumer behavior, and it adapts its performance advertising channels—search engine keyword purchases, referrals from meta-search and travel research sites, affiliate programs and other performance-based advertisements—to optimize efficiency and support scalability. Information technology expenses, comprising software license and system maintenance fees, data communications, outsourced data center costs and payments to outside consultants, have increased in line with worldwide operations, while depreciation and amortization reflect capital expenditures for additional data center capacity and office build-outs to support growth and geographic expansion. As part of its strategy to enhance its IT capability, Booking.com is increasingly processing transactions on a merchant basis to facilitate payments and offer flexible transaction terms, and the company continues to deploy and reconfigure technology resources through platform enhancements, business analytics services such as BookingSuite, acquisitions like the Momondo Group and strategic investments in digital infrastructure to drive operational flexibility, address competitive and regulatory challenges and transform its IT function’s competence into a key source of competitive advantage.

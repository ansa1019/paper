da Vinci surgical systems are described as integrated platforms combining “computational, robotic and imaging technologies” with a surgeon’s console, imaging electronics, patient‐side cart and supporting hardware and software to extend the benefits of minimally invasive surgery by overcoming conventional limitations and filtering tremor, while the console’s immersive 3-D visualization “connects surgeons to the surgical field and their instruments.”  The company’s training technologies, including the da Vinci Skills Simulator, da Vinci Connect remote case observation and mentoring tool and dual console for collaborative surgery, illustrate the firm’s information management capability and connectivity in supporting knowledge application and mentoring.  The launch of the da Vinci X leverages existing vision cart and console architectures to provide “advanced robotic-assisted surgery technology at a lower cost,” driving operational efficiencies through set-up technology that uses voice and laser guidance and a fully integrated endoscope, and offering a clear upgrade pathway as clinical needs grow.  Integrated Table Motion further exemplifies strategic resource integration by coordinating robot arm movements with an advanced operating room table in real time to optimize patient positioning, multi-quadrant access and workflow.  Research and development investments emphasize advanced imaging and analytics, robotic-assisted catheter devices and next-generation robotics, reflecting the firm’s ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure technology resources, information systems and management skills in support of business strategies, process innovation and competitive advantage.

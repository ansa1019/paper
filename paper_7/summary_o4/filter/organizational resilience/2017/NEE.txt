The discussion describes extensive use of complex financial and operational processes—such as the deployment of derivative instruments (swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage fuel, power, interest‐rate and foreign‐currency risk; the application of discounted cash flow valuation techniques and forward price curves to estimate fair values; the use of exposure management committees to approve market‐risk policies; credit‐department monitoring of current and forward counterparty exposures; master netting agreements and collateral management to mitigate credit risk; value‐at‐risk modeling for commodity price exposure; and regulatory accounting systems to capture and defer mark-to-market energy derivative adjustments—each of which implies substantial information management capability in coordinating data acquisition, analysis, timeliness, reliability, security and connectivity in support of strategic decision‐making, operational flexibility and organizational governance across the firm’s internal processes and interfirm transactions.

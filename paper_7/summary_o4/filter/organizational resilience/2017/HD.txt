During fiscal 2017, online sales—sales generated online through our websites for products picked up in our stores or delivered to customer locations—represented 6.7% of net sales and grew 21.5%, and digital or otherwise acquisitions are included in comparable sales after ownership exceeds 52 weeks. The company deployed $1.9 billion of capital expenditures for investments in our business, including software acquisitions and license commitments, and leveraged expense control and supply chain productivity benefits driven by our inventory management systems. Working capital management, influenced by inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, and vendor payment terms, is supported by our information systems to reflect seasonality and market dynamics. We use derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies and interest rates and employ commercial paper programs and credit facilities with technology‐based monitoring to support liquidity and capital resources. Vendor allowances, including volume rebates and co-op advertising allowances, are accrued and recorded as reductions to merchandise inventories and cost of sales through our information platforms, and non-GAAP financial measures such as ROIC are calculated using data analytics and reconciled against GAAP measures to inform strategic resource allocation.

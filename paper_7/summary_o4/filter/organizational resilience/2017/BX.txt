Blackstone’s discussion, while not explicitly using the term “IT capability,” repeatedly highlights the deployment of technology-based resources to support and enhance its investment and management processes: for example, Strategic Partners “leverages its proprietary database” to acquire fund interests and complex portfolios “in an efficient and timely manner,” and the Real Estate group “capitalizes on our scale and proprietary information advantages” to inform differentiated views and active asset management, implicitly underscoring information management capabilities that deliver data with the accuracy, timeliness and connectivity necessary for effective decision-making. In its operating expense analysis, Blackstone also identifies “communications and information services” as a key component of general and administrative costs, reflecting investment in technology functionalities and infrastructure to facilitate internal coordination, interfirm relationships and reporting. References to the continuous optimization of approaches in Tactical Opportunities amid evolving market conditions, the use of monitoring systems within consolidated collateralized loan obligations and the governance of fee-earning and performance-fee calculations further imply systematic deployment of IT systems and processes—combining software, data management and managerial skills—to support strategic resource allocation, operational flexibility, market responsiveness and competitive advantage.

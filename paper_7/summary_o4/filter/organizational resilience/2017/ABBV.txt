AbbVie’s 2017 MD&A does not explicitly describe information technology capabilities but discloses a number of processes and investments whose effective execution would rely on robust IT‐enabled coordination of assets, internal processes and external relationships. For example, the company highlights “productivity initiatives in supply chain and ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses,” which imply IT‐supported process automation, data integration and connectivity across functions. AbbVie also details its use of “internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time,” evaluating “inventory data reported by wholesalers, available prescription volume information, product pricing, historical experience and other factors” to establish and adjust rebate and chargeback reserves, reflecting an information management capability that provides “data and information to users with the appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security … connectivity and access.” In its revenue analysis, the Company describes non‐GAAP measures “when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure … to facilitate analysis of the company’s results of operations,” suggesting integrated analytics and reporting systems. The discussion of actuarial valuations—employing a yield‐curve approach, spot rates and scenario probabilities in estimating pension obligations and fair‐value remeasurements of contingent consideration liabilities—underscores the firm’s ability to mobilize and deploy technology resources for complex financial modeling, forecasting and strategic resource allocation. Continuous monitoring of economic conditions, customer creditworthiness, trade receivables and global exchange-rate impacts likewise points to IT‐facilitated risk management, data analytics and decision-support infrastructures that underpin AbbVie’s operational flexibility and strategic management practices.

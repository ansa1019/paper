The MD&A emphasizes the firm’s evolution and deployment of information technology capabilities through its next-generation security platform, which “uses an innovative traffic classification engine that identifies network traffic by application, user, and content and provides consistent security across the network, endpoint, and cloud,” integrates proprietary hardware and software architecture to deliver application-level visibility and control, and simplifies security operations and infrastructure by eliminating the need for multiple, stand-alone appliances. The platform’s advanced endpoint protection software “prevents cyberattacks that aim to run malicious code or exploit software vulnerabilities on a broad variety of fixed, mobile, and virtual endpoints and servers,” while the threat intelligence cloud “provides central intelligence capabilities, security for SaaS applications, and automated delivery of preventative measures against cyberattacks.” Subscriptions grant end-customers “real-time access to the latest antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, and modern malware prevention capabilities across fixed and mobile devices,” and forthcoming offerings such as the GlobalProtect cloud service and logging service subscriptions extend data and log management without the need for local processing resources. The firm continues to invest in its platform—expanding physical and virtual firewall models, releasing PAN-OS 8.0 to enhance cloud and SaaS security, acquiring LightCyber to add behavioral analytics, and developing the Palo Alto Networks Application Framework to enable rapid, cloud-based application deployment—asserting that growth and competitive position hinge on its ability to extend technology leadership, expand platform and support deployments, and improve customer satisfaction. To support this, the company must “continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner,” and it allocates certain facilities and information technology costs based on headcount, underscoring the centrality of IT capability in transforming the firm and sustaining its competitive advantage.

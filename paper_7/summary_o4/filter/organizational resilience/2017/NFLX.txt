Netflix has built its own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) and proprietary recommendation and merchandising technology to support fast and efficient delivery of streaming content over the Internet and to tailor content suggestions to member preferences; it has architected its software and computer systems to utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other services provided by third-party cloud computing platforms, primarily Amazon Web Services, and relies on its own communications and computer hardware systems in its facilities and those of third-party web hosting providers to scale its streaming operations and support features growth. It is developing technology and utilizing third-party “cloud” computing services to expand capacity, and maintains its own content-delivery network (“CDN”) to optimize high-volume content distribution, while also employing third-party technology to market services, process payments and manage daily operations. Netflix’s technology and development expenses reflect investments in personnel, hardware, software, testing and infrastructure to continuously improve the user interface, streaming delivery technology and system reliability. The company acknowledges that any failure, unavailability or interference in its proprietary or third-party technology—such as disruptions in AWS, CDNs, ISPs or internal systems—bugs in software development or cyber-attacks could degrade service quality, impair data confidentiality, integrity and access, and adversely impact customer experience and business performance. To mitigate such risks the company has implemented systems and processes to thwart unauthorized access and protect member and corporate data, including encryption and authentication technologies for sensitive billing information, but recognizes that cybersecurity efforts are costly and may affect system functionality. Netflix collects and utilizes member data to inform content acquisition and merchandising decisions, while facing evolving legal obligations and regulatory requirements concerning data privacy, localization and transfer; failure to comply with these obligations or a material data breach could subject the company to liability, reputational harm and operational disruption. Additionally, changes in Internet regulation and network operator practices, such as alterations in net neutrality, network access policies or usage-based pricing, could restrict connectivity or increase operating expenses, thereby affecting service accessibility, investment in infrastructure capability and overall IT effectiveness.

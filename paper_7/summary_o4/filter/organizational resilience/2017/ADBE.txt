We continually expand and improve our information technology resources and digital platforms to support and enhance business strategies and work processes, as evidenced by frequent technology upgrades across our cloud offerings—including Creative Cloud’s subscription-based delivery of frequent product updates, cloud storage, file-syncing and marketplace integration; Document Cloud’s integrated desktop and mobile services for document creation, review, approval, signing and tracking; and Adobe Experience Cloud’s Marketing Cloud solutions for campaign orchestration and personalization, Analytics Cloud for real-time data capture, aggregation and customer profiling, and Advertising Cloud for cross-channel media optimization—while leveraging a direct sales force and an ecosystem of partners to license and deploy these solutions. Our cost of subscription revenue reflects ongoing investments in network infrastructure, data center hosting services, computer equipment depreciation, third-party technology royalties and dedicated personnel in network operations, implementation, account management and technical support, all designed to deliver timely, reliable, secure and scalable IT-driven services. Through structured multiple-element arrangements blending software licenses, upgrades, maintenance, hosted services and consulting, we determine delivery and fair value using vendor-specific objective evidence, third-party evidence or best-estimated selling price, demonstrating our information management capability to tailor IT resources to evolving customer and market needs. The integration of acquired platforms—such as TubeMogul’s video advertising capabilities into our Advertising Cloud and Fotolia’s marketplace into Digital Media—further illustrates our ability to acquire, deploy and reconfigure IT resources in combination with other organizational capabilities to maintain competitive agility and support end-to-end customer workflows in a dynamic digital environment.

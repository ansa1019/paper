We continue to make significant research and development investments in strategic focus areas such as advertising, cloud, machine learning and search, as well as in new products and services, with R&D expenses—consisting primarily of compensation, stock‐based compensation and facilities‐related costs for employees responsible for the development of our existing and new offerings—rising to $16.6 billion in 2017. Our capital expenditures, which amounted to $13.2 billion, have fluctuated and may continue to do so as we invest heavily in our systems, data centers, real estate and facilities and information technology infrastructure. Other cost of revenues increased by $5.6 billion, driven by data center and other operations costs—including depreciation, compensation expenses, energy, bandwidth and equipment—and by hardware costs associated with new product launches and increased content acquisition activities for YouTube. General and administrative expenses include compensation and facilities‐related costs for employees in our information technology organization, as well as professional services fees for information technology consulting, and these costs have grown modestly in line with headcount and outsourcing engagements. We have non-cancelable contractual obligations primarily related to data center operations and build-outs, digital media content licensing arrangements and inventory purchase commitments, reflecting our ongoing investment in technology operations and infrastructure.

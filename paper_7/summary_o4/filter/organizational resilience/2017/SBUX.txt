Operating margin compression in fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by increased partner (employee) and digital investments, largely in the Americas segment. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues increased due to higher partner and digital investments in the Americas, partially offset by sales leverage. General and administrative expenses were partially offset by increased salaries and benefits related to digital platforms, technology infrastructure and innovations. Looking ahead, one of the Companyâ€™s six operational priorities for fiscal 2018 is to accelerate the power and momentum of its digital platform, with growth expected to be driven by new customer acquisition through digital engagement and innovation alongside store expansion. Fiscal 2018 capital expenditures of approximately $2.0 billion are expected to fund investments in new and existing stores, the developing Siren retail business, supply chain and corporate facilities, which will include supporting information technology resources to enable these strategic objectives.

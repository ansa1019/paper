In 2017, we continued to invest, based on our roadmap, in our most developed ecosystem, the Facebook app and platform and video, in driving growth and building ecosystems around our products and features that already have significant user bases—such as Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp—and in long-term technology initiatives, such as connectivity, artificial intelligence, and augmented and virtual reality, that we believe will further our mission to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together; we intend to continue to invest based on this roadmap and anticipate that additional investments in security, video content, and our long-term technology initiatives and in scaling our headcount and expanding our data center capacity and office facilities to support our growth will drive significant year-over-year expense growth in 2018. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products, including expenses related to the operation of our data centers—such as facility and server equipment depreciation, operational salaries and benefits, energy and bandwidth costs—and costs associated with partner arrangements, reflecting the infrastructure and IT resources necessary to support our services. Research and development expenses consist primarily of share-based compensation, salaries, and benefits for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products. Payments revenue is comprised of the net fee we receive from developers using our payments infrastructure. Cash used in investing activities during 2017 mostly resulted from $13.25 billion for net purchases of marketable securities and $6.73 billion for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, office buildings, and network infrastructure; as part of the normal course of business, we may enter into multi-year agreements to purchase certain network components or renewable energy to secure either volume or price, with total estimated commitments of approximately $4.0 billion, and we anticipate making capital expenditures in 2018 of approximately $14.0 billion to $15.0 billion.

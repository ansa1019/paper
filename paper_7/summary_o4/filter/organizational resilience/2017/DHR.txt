The company’s MD&A highlights the breadth of its products, software and services and identifies rapid technological development—particularly in computing, automation, artificial intelligence, mobile connectivity, communications and digitization—as both a challenge and opportunity across its global markets. To address this rapid pace of technological change and enhance responsiveness to customer needs, the company is making significant investments organically and through acquisitions to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources and improve operational efficiency. Capital expenditures include investments in information technology systems alongside facility expansions and new product development, reflecting the firm’s commitment to strengthening its IT infrastructure and processes. In the diagnostics segment, the strategic decision to discontinue a molecular diagnostic product line resulted in noncash impairment charges for certain technology-related intangible assets and related inventory and equipment, underscoring the evolving scope and value of IT-driven assets. Separation activities in 2016 and 2015 incurred professional fees associated with information system functions, emphasizing the critical role of IT capabilities in regulatory, finance, tax and legal processes. As recently acquired businesses such as Cepheid are integrated, the application of the Danaher Business System has driven cost savings and business process improvements, demonstrating the firm’s competence in deploying management practices and IT-enabled process optimization. Research and development expenses, consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs, further reflect ongoing investments in technology-driven innovation. The product identification segment’s provision of equipment, software, services and consumables for color and appearance management, packaging design, printing, marking, coding and traceability illustrates the company’s deployment of software solutions to support customer workflows and quality management.

The MD&A discloses that the company’s additions to fixed assets and capitalized software of $302 million in 2017 and $253 million in 2016 primarily comprised computer equipment purchases, office facility modernization and software development costs, reflecting investments in technology infrastructure to support business processes and operational efficiency. It also describes the delivery of consulting and analytics services by Marsh and Guy Carpenter—including catastrophe and financial modeling—that rely on data processing capacity, analytical tools and connectivity to insurers and clients, underscoring the firm’s deployment of IT-based resources to coordinate internal and interfirm activities. The company’s global transactional capabilities, serving clients in more than 130 countries, imply an underlying information systems capability and digital infrastructure to enable timely, reliable and secure provision of analysis, advice and transaction support. Commitments of approximately $57 million to private equity funds focused on financial services may further enhance access to technology-driven resources and innovation opportunities in support of its strategic objectives.

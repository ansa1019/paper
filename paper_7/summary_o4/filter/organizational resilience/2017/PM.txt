Philip Morris International describes leveraging multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation to satisfy adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements; structuring its operations from four to six reportable segments to allocate resources and sharpen focus on combustible and reduced-risk products as part of its transformation toward a smoke-free future; defining and analyzing net revenues net of sales and promotion incentives, volume and product mix and geographic mix to inform strategic resource deployment and performance measurement; managing the collection and remittance of excise taxes as integrated elements of revenue and tax reporting; delineating cost of sales—including tobacco leaf, non-tobacco raw materials, labor and manufacturing costs and third-party IQOS device production—and marketing, administration and research expenses to support budgeting and operational control; operating under a holding-company governance framework in which dividends and debt repayments from separately chartered subsidiaries fund debt service and distributions; and projecting net revenue growth, operating cash flow and capital expenditures—all of which implicitly depend on the coordination, deployment and reconfiguration of information, data and technology resources and internal processes to support strategic decision-making, operational efficiency and the firm’s ongoing transformation.

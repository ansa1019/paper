Capital expenditure plans indicate that, to a lesser extent, capital is required for initial warehouse operations, our information systems, and working capital, with expenditures of $2,502 in 2017 and projected $2,500 to $2,700 in fiscal 2018, financed with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Central operating costs were higher by one basis point, primarily due to increased costs associated with our information systems modernization, including increased depreciation for projects placed in service, incurred by our U.S. operations. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2017 when compared to 2016 was primarily due to accelerated vendor payments of approximately $1,700 made in the last week of fiscal 2016, in advance of implementing our modernized accounting system. Operating costs related to warehouses, ancillary, and other businesses, which includes e-commerce and travel, were lower by nine basis points, primarily due to lower costs associated with the co-branded credit card arrangement in the U.S. of 18 basis points, and our e-commerce business growth both domestically and internationally has also increased our sales.

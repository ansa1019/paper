Management’s description of an “executive overview” intended to assist readers in understanding and assessing significant changes and trends in our consolidated operations and financial position implies reliance on information management capability to deliver accurate, timely and reliable data. References to our use of hedging and other risk-management techniques through derivative financial instruments, as well as foreign exchange rate monitoring and scenario modeling for short-term borrowing needs, suggest underlying IT-based analytics and connectivity for real-time financial exposures. Disclosures on acquisitions and integrations—such as the recognition and valuation of acquired in-process research and development assets and contingent consideration liabilities—presume robust information systems for project tracking, data consolidation and fair-value estimation. Our discussion of sales return, rebate and discount accruals, which involves estimating liabilities based on historical return rates, wholesaler inventory levels, contractual terms and government-mandated pricing rebates, points to IT systems for sales data collection, inventory monitoring and contract management. Statements concerning the management of research and development spending across a global portfolio of molecules, monitoring of capital expenditures and planning of capital allocation priorities—including dividends, share repurchases, business development investments and debt reduction—reflect use of IT-enabled financial planning and resource allocation tools. Descriptions of manufacturing efficiencies, site closures, cost-structure reduction efforts and process performance improvements imply deployment of ERP and process-automation systems to optimize internal processes and support business transformation. Finally, our capacity to project cash flows, assess long-term debt and contractual obligations, and evaluate tax-law changes under the 2017 Tax Act underscores the role of integrated information systems in enabling data-driven strategic decision-making and governance.

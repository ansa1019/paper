The company has expressly identified “digitizing the enterprise” as one of its five strategic priorities, and under its productivity and reinvestment program—first announced in February 2012 and expanded through 2019—it has focused on “global supply chain optimization; global marketing and innovation effectiveness; operating expense leverage and operational excellence; data and information technology systems standardization; and the integration of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.’s former North America bottling operations.”  As part of refranchising certain bottling territories, the company recorded costs associated with “the implementation of information technology systems to facilitate consistent data standards and availability throughout our bottling systems,” demonstrating its commitment to deploying IT‐based resources and standardized information management to support business strategies, enhance operational efficiency and coordinate assets and processes across its global value chain.

In 2017 our research, development and engineering expenses, which represented 6.3% of net sales, were driven by projects to develop new products, investments in new technologies and recent acquisitions, reflecting our continued commitment to innovation, while capital expenditures were primarily directed toward the development of our global ERP system and investments in new and existing plants and equipment to support sales growth. We have focused on operating expense improvement initiatives, including leverage from recent acquisitions and productivity enhancements, and maintain a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations to support our operating needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other discretionary uses. Operating cash flow provides our primary source of funding and is supplemented as necessary by debt issuances to fund acquisitions, share repurchases and other strategic activities, with excess operating cash allocated first to high-priority investments and acquisitions to further complement our portfolio of businesses.

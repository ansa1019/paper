Merck’s MD&A describes its healthcare services segment as providing “services and solutions that focus on engagement, health analytics and clinical services to improve the value of care delivered to patients,” implicitly reflecting the firm’s capability to acquire, deploy and tailor information and analytics in support of business strategies and work processes.  The company also reports that on June 27, 2017 it “experienced a network cyber-attack that led to a disruption of its worldwide operations, including manufacturing, research and sales operations,” which “prevented the fulfillment of certain product orders,” had an unfavorable effect on sales of approximately $260 million for the year, and generated approximately $285 million of manufacturing-related and remediation expenses (net of insurance recoveries of $45 million), thereby underscoring the critical importance of mobilizing and safeguarding IT-based resources in combination with other organizational assets.  Merck notes that its external manufacturing was not impacted and that it “continued to fulfill orders and ship product” to the extent possible, that it does not expect a significant impairment of intangible assets related to marketed products or inventories as a result of the incident, and that it maintains insurance coverage insuring against costs resulting from cyber-attacks and has received proceeds—while acknowledging potential disputes with insurers about coverage availability in connection with this incident.

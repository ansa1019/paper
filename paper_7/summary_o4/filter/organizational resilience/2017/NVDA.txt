Nvidia has evolved the GPU into what it describes as a “computer brain at the intersection of VR, HPC, and AI,” extending its unified GPU and CUDA architecture to create platforms for gaming, professional visualization, datacenter and automotive markets; the GeForce, Quadro, Tesla, DGX and GRID product brands leverage proprietary processors and software to deliver targeted solutions for gamers, designers, AI data scientists, big-data researchers and cloud-based visual computing users.  The Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, combining GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, cars, consoles and mobile entertainment devices.  In fiscal 2018 Nvidia released new Pascal-architecture gaming GPUs, introduced Max-Q-designed gaming laptops, enhanced GeForce Experience with tools such as NVIDIA Freestyle and Ansel photo mode, and expanded its professional visualization platform with early access to NVIDIA Holodeck, the Quadro Virtual Data Center Workstation, Project Holodeck collaborative VR, external GPU support and the NVIDIA OptiX 5.0 and VRWorks 360 software development kits.  For its datacenter platform, Nvidia announced Tesla V100 GPU accelerators available through every major computer maker and cloud provider, added 34 GPU-accelerated systems to the Top 500 supercomputer list, forged partnerships to advance AI in key verticals and launched the NVIDIA GPU Cloud Container Registry to support HPC and AI researchers.  In the automotive and edge AI markets, Nvidia introduced the Drive AI self-driving platform, the Drive Xavier autonomous machine processor, Drive PX Pegasus auto-grade AI computer, Jetson TX2 high-performance, low-power AI-at-the-edge platform, the NVIDIA Isaac robot simulator and the NVIDIA Metropolis deep-learning-based smart-city surveillance platform, thereby mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other organizational capabilities to support and enhance its business strategies and work processes.

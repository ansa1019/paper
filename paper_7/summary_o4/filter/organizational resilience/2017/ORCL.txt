Oracle Corporation describes its IT capability as an integrated suite of products and services that span applications, platform and infrastructure across on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid deployment models, enabling customers to choose the configuration that best meets their business needs. The Company’s fully integrated Oracle Cloud stack of SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings is architected to be rapidly deployable to accelerate innovation, easily maintainable to minimize integration and testing overhead, connectable across disparate environments to facilitate interchangeability and workload mobility, cost-effective by reducing upfront investment, and secure, standards-based and reliable. As a leader in core cloud IT technologies—including database and middleware software, enterprise applications, virtualization, clustering, large-scale systems management and related infrastructure—Oracle leverages its deep understanding of how diverse technologies interact to improve performance, security, operational integration and manageability, thereby enhancing customer computing efficiency relative to competitors. Customers further benefit from ongoing research and development and Oracle’s IT expertise through support renewals for on-premise deployments and subscription renewals for cloud services. In recognition of evolving regulatory, data residency and sovereignty requirements, Oracle supports hybrid IT strategies and on-premise cloud consumption via its Cloud at Customer program, which brings select PaaS and IaaS services into customer data centers, enabling organizations to evolve and transform their IT deployment model at a pace aligned with their strategic, compliance and operational objectives.

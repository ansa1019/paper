Nike’s strategic Consumer Direct Offense emphasizes leveraging the power of digital to accelerate innovation and product creation, move closer to consumers in key cities and deepen one-to-one connections, underpinned by substantial investments in new technologies and infrastructure to increase automation, reduce waste, enhance product customization and speed to market. These infrastructure investments improve operational efficiency and effectiveness by expanding consumer-focused digital capabilities across Nike-owned internet websites and mobile applications, which collectively drive growth in the higher-margin direct-to-consumer business. As a result, DTC revenues rose to approximately 28 percent of total Nike brand revenues in fiscal 2017, with digital commerce sales growing 30 percent on a currency-neutral basis and reaching $2.2 billion, while continued investments in consumer engagement and retail brand presentation through digital commerce are financed via operating cash flows and targeted capital expenditures—planned to average about 4 percent of revenues—to support future growth. Operational overhead expenses reflect the reallocation of resources toward these digital initiatives, partially offset by administrative cost efficiencies and lower variable compensation, and demand creation expense similarly reflects higher marketing and advertising spend to support key digital and brand events, all of which underscore Nike’s ongoing commitment to mobilize information-based resources in support of its business strategies, work processes and compelling consumer experiences across retail, online and mobile channels.

Prologis’ MD&A describes a sophisticated information management capability through its use of non-GAAP performance measures such as NOI by segment and same-store analyses, which “help management and investors understand the core operations of our real estate assets” by providing data that is accurate, timely and reliable; the firm’s allocation of property management and strategic capital expenses across its consolidated real estate operations and strategic capital segments based on square footage illustrates its ability to mobilize and coordinate financial, operational and portfolio data across assets and internal processes; detailed reconciliations of rental revenues, recoveries, rental expenses and property NOI—adjusting for contributions and dispositions, foreign currency effects and derivative transactions—demonstrate an integrated reporting and analytics infrastructure that underpins strategic resource allocation and market-based decision making; complex revenue recognition judgments for contributions, sales of properties and promote fees, as well as the fair-value allocation in acquisitions and step-acquisitions, reflect the firm’s capacity to deploy and reconfigure information systems and accounting processes in support of business strategies; management of debt, revolvers, term loans and unhedged derivative transactions across multiple currencies highlights real-time monitoring systems and connectivity to support financing decisions; capitalization of development and leasing costs, including incremental general and administrative expenses and salaries, underscores the use of technology-enabled cost tracking and project management tools; and the articulation of critical accounting policies—consolidation, revenue recognition, income taxes, impairment, capitalization and FFO reconciliation—reveals the firm’s competence in leveraging integrated IT-based resources and governance frameworks to transform data into actionable investments, ensure compliance, drive organizational performance and maintain competitive advantage.

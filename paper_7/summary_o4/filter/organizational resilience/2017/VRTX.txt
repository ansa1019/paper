In our revenue recognition process, we recognize net product revenues upon delivery when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the price is fixed or determinable, and we estimate net product revenues by tracking trade allowances, estimated government and private payor rebates, chargebacks, discounts, reserves for product returns and patient co-pay assistance, adjusting these estimates as new information becomes available and monitoring actual returns and distribution‚Äêchannel inventory by lot. We contract with government agencies and engage with commercial insurers and managed health care organizations to obtain and maintain appropriate reimbursement levels on a country-by-country basis, dedicating substantial management and other resources and compliance systems to identify, prevent and mitigate risk and to support negotiations. We evaluate our collaborations and variable interest entities by assessing clinical data, collaboration activities, fair value of contingent milestone, royalty and option payments using probability-weighted present-value models based on development timelines, regulatory considerations, future net cash flows, discount rates and patient population estimates, and we reassess on a quarterly basis whether we remain the primary beneficiary. We assess and capitalize inventories for anticipated regulatory approval and market launch, perform periodic recoverability analyses requiring judgments about expected reimbursements and competitive market conditions, and write down excess or obsolete inventory. We manage liquidity and capital resources by forecasting cash flows from product sales, compliance with debt covenants, employee benefit plan issuances and strategic collaborative funding commitments, and by coordinating internal processes and interfirm transactions for financing, lease obligations and contingent licensing payments to align with our business strategies.

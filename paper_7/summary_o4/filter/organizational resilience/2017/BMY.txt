The discussion of global enabling functions describes administrative, finance, legal and information technology as pooled enterprise-wide resources that support our marketing, selling and administrative activities and our research and development allocations, while intangible assets include capitalized software to reflect investments in IT systems. We rely on internal information systems and third-party data to estimate channel inventory, sales returns and government rebates, and we maintain governance processes—including formal review and certification of SEC filings and escalation procedures for policy compliance—to ensure information reliability and control. Company-wide operating model transformation initiatives have streamlined our commercial infrastructure, administrative functions and manufacturing network, sharpening our ability to focus resources on prioritized brands and markets, strengthen R&D capabilities in tumor biology and patient selection, and invest in high-priority portfolio opportunities with greater operational flexibility. Collectively, these actions underscore an evolving capability to mobilize and deploy technology and organizational resources in support of strategic decisions, process optimization and enhanced coordination of assets, internal processes and interfirm relationships.

PepsiCo’s Discussion and Analysis explains that, to address shifting market dynamics and consumer preferences, the company is “continuing our investments in e-commerce and digital solutions to meet changing consumer consumption patterns and capture cost savings while streamlining our operations,” and is actively “monitoring changes in the retail landscape— including the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications and the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers”—with the objective of “building our global e-commerce capabilities, distributing our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigating any unfavorable impacts on our future results.”  To underpin these initiatives, PepsiCo “leverages an integrated risk management framework” that provides “ongoing guidance, tools and analytical support” to its senior management, division and country risk committees and board of directors, thereby enhancing information management capability, support for strategic decision-making and integration of internal processes.  In addition, the company describes its productivity initiatives and global purchasing programs— including fixed-price contracts, purchase orders and pricing agreements—and the central management of commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate derivative instruments as means to mobilize technology-based resources, analytical insights and process efficiencies in support of its business strategies and operational flexibility.

Visa leverages its advanced transaction processing network, VisaNet, which “enables authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions” and supports the coordination of a firm’s assets and internal processes across more than 200 countries and territories by providing financial institution and merchant clients with a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. We earn data processing revenues for “authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally,” and incur network and processing expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. Depreciation and amortization expenses reflect both depreciation of property and equipment and “amortization of purchased and internally developed software,” underscoring continued investment in technology resources. Capital expenditures increased in fiscal 2017 “due to investments in technology assets, infrastructure and growth initiatives,” and we expect to “continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives.” In February 2017, we acquired a business for $302 million “to help Visa’s clients and merchant partners accelerate digital commerce,” reflecting our strategic focus on enhancing digital technologies, operational flexibility, information accuracy and connectivity to sustain competitive advantage and firm performance.

Our 2017 results reflect the benefits of targeted network investments and portfolio initiatives designed to optimize our integrated air and ground infrastructure, and we continue to deploy and utilize advanced technologies—such as our orion routing system and expanded Saturday ground operations—to enhance package sorting and delivery productivity and contain the growth of average daily vehicle miles driven. Capital spending on information technology rose significantly in 2017 to advance our smart logistics network, support targeted technology enhancements and capitalize internally developed software projects, with related depreciation and amortization expense incorporating both acquired intangible assets and longer-lived, internally developed software. These coordinated technology deployments and infrastructure upgrades underpin our operational flexibility, process automation and capacity expansion in response to sustained volume growth.

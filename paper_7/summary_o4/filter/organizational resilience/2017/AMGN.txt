Amgen has implemented significant enterprise transformation and process improvement efforts, committing “to a more agile and efficient operating model” and realizing “approximately $1.5 billion of transformation and process improvement savings” to “reallocate resources to fund many of our innovative pipeline and growth opportunities that deliver value to patients and stockholders,” thereby strengthening its capability to coordinate internal resources, processes and interfirm relationships and to approach new product development “with greater understanding, speed and confidence.” In preparation for 2018, the company “expanded our transformation activities and savings initiatives to enable investment in new products and the defense of existing products to optimize long- and short-term growth,” establishing a foundation for growth and business transformation. In managing operational risk and resource deployment, Amgen “monitors the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties” and “analyzes the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly,” adjusting for rebates, chargebacks and other deductions as market trends or significant events dictate, which underscores its information management capability to provide accurate, timely and reliable data in support of decision-making and operational efficiency. Financial governance is bolstered by “hedging our net foreign currency exposure” through derivative contracts designated as fair value and cash flow hedges, maintaining “global access to our $41.7 billion balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities” under the 2017 Tax Act to unlock additional financial flexibility, and adhering to an investment policy that “limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer,” all of which facilitate coordinated deployment of financial resources, support flexible capital allocation decisions and enhance organizational agility in response to changing business needs and market dynamics.

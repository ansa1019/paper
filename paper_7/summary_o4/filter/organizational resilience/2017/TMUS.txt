Management believes its Un-carrier strategy, coupled with ongoing network improvements, has been successful in attracting and retaining customers and improving branded customer growth and churn. Selling, general and administrative expenses include costs related to outsourced functions and managed services to support our growing customer base, such as customer support and billing. Property and equipment capital expenditures primarily relate to network transformation, including the build-out of 700 MHz a-block and 600 MHz spectrum licenses. Moreover, the implementation of the first component of our new billing system and the continued build-out of our 4G LTE network illustrate key investments in technology infrastructure and systems capability.

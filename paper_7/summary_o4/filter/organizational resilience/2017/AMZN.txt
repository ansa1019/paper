Amazon’s annual report describes extensive investments in its technology infrastructure and digital capabilities, noting that its fixed costs include “the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our websites and web services, our electronic devices, and digital offerings,” and that technology and content costs encompass “payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our websites, curation and display of products and services made available on our websites, and infrastructure costs,” including servers, networking equipment and data center depreciation, rent and utilities to support AWS. The company “seeks to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies,” and anticipates that “advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the internet,” leading to further “investments in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices.” Capitalized internal-use software and website development costs were $642 million, $511 million and $395 million in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively, with amortization of $635 million, $634 million and $545 million, and property and equipment acquired under capital leases—primarily for AWS infrastructure—totaled $4.7 billion, $5.7 billion and $9.6 billion in those years, demonstrating Amazon’s capability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources in support of its business strategies and operational scalability.

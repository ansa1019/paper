During the third quarter of 2015, the company implemented a restructuring plan focused on simplifying its business and better aligning resources around strategic priorities, which involved a reduction of global headcount and the outsourcing of certain IT services and application development to streamline internal processes and enhance operational flexibility; these actions were completed by the first quarter of 2017, eliminating related liabilities and illustrating management’s ability to reconfigure technology-based resources in support of evolving business needs. In 2017, research and development expenses increased to $1.16 billion, driven by strategic investments in product engineering and design for datacenter and other high-performance products across both reportable segments, underscoring the firm’s competence in acquiring, deploying and combining technology resources to execute its business strategies and work processes. Under the sixth amendment to the wafer supply agreement, the company established a comprehensive framework for technology collaboration with GlobalFoundries for the 7nm technology node and secured limited waivers to source wafers from additional foundries, thereby expanding coordination of assets and internal processes as well as interfirm transactions and relationships. The formation and ongoing support of equity joint ventures for advanced packaging, test and IP development—including the ATMP joint venture and the THATIC joint venture—further exemplify the company’s mobilization of physical and intangible technology resources, management skills and business process understanding to transform operations, support innovation and strengthen its competitive positioning.

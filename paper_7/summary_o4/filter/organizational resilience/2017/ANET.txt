At the core of our cloud networking platform is EOS, purpose‐built to be fully programmable and highly modular, which has allowed us to develop software applications for workflow automation, network visibility and analytics and to rapidly integrate with third‐party applications for virtualization, management, automation, orchestration and network services, reflecting our mobilization of IT‐based resources and our ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources in support of business strategies and work processes. We believe one of our greatest strengths lies in our rapid development of new features and applications, and we intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization to enhance the functionality of our existing platform, introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership, consistent with the evolving scope of information technology capabilities in coordinating a firm’s assets, internal processes and interfirm relationships. In order to support our strong growth, we have and may continue to accelerate our investment in infrastructure, such as enterprise resource planning software and other technologies to improve the efficiency of our operations, and allocate significant facility and IT costs, including depreciation, across research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative functions. Our development model focuses on enhancements to EOS and new product releases that are agnostic to underlying merchant silicon, enabling us to leverage vendor investments to achieve cost-effective switching and routing solutions. We continue to expand relationships with multiple merchant silicon vendors, channel, technology and system-level partners and work closely with third-party contract manufacturers to manage manufacturing, final configuration, quality assurance testing and shipment of our products, underscoring our integration of technology resources, organizational capabilities and interfirm processes to deliver scalable, programmable, automatable and secure cloud networking solutions. Our post-contract support service contracts, which include technical support, hardware repair and unspecified upgrades, are structured as renewable, fee-based arrangements, with revenue deferred and recognized ratably over the contract term, demonstrating our commitment to providing data and information with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access in response to changing business needs.

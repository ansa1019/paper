In our automotive segment, we continue to enhance our vehicle offerings with enhanced autopilot options, internet connectivity and free over-the-air software updates to provide additional safety, convenience and performance features, and in 2018 and beyond we expect to rollout new autopilot features following an overhaul of the underlying architecture of our software, which enabled a step-change improvement in the collection and analysis of data and fundamentally enhanced its machine learning capabilities. The aggregate of such data and learnings, which we refer to as our “neural net,” is able to collect and analyze more high-quality data than ever before. Our cost of automotive sales revenue also reflects vehicle connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our supercharger network, while our selling, general and administrative expenses include office, information technology and facilities-related costs to support the growth of our business and digital sales channels. In our energy generation and storage segment, we recognize deferred revenue and fees for remote monitoring service of solar energy systems under operating leases and power purchase agreements, reflecting our ability to deploy information management capabilities to provide connectivity, monitoring and tailored data services to customers. These initiatives illustrate our competence to deploy IT-based resources, infrastructure and management skills to support operational efficiency, enhanced connectivity, digital feature deployment and the ongoing transformation of our products and services.

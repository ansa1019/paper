We invest in manufacturing technologies and do most of our manufacturing in-house, a strategic decision that ensures a consistent supply of products, enables targeted technology deployment to differentiate product features and supports process optimization and operational efficiency; we have focused on creating a competitive manufacturing cost advantage by increasing factory loadings of advanced analog 300-millimeter wafers and by using mature assets acquired ahead of demand, reflecting deliberate resource allocation and capacity management; customers often begin their initial product selection process and design-in journey on our website, and our extensive web presence, combined with a global sales force, provides unique access to about 100,000 customers, underscoring our investment in digital infrastructure, connectivity, customer relationship management and information provision with appropriate accuracy, timeliness and access; over time, we have been allocating resources from manufacturing support and SG&A into R&D activities, with more than $1 billion invested annually to develop new products and with capital expenditures primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment, demonstrating our commitment to technology resource investment, capability enhancement, innovation partnerships and process development; our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from operations, supplemented by cash, short-term investments and a revolving credit facility, evidencing our financial resource mobilization and operational flexibility; in managing revenue recognition, we deploy information systems capability to recognize sales upon shipment or delivery, record allowances based on analysis of historical data and contractual terms, and reasonably estimate credits to distributors in a timely manner; we applied ASU 2017-07 on a full retrospective basis, reflecting our change management and systems integration in financial reporting; we maintain critical accounting policies that require judgment in provisions for income taxes, deferred tax asset recoverability and inventory valuation allowances based on statistical analysis of historical disposals and market conditions, highlighting our information processing capacity, reliability and governance practices; and we have no significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, demonstrating transparency, institutional governance and adherence to regulatory and disclosure requirements.

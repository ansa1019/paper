Cisco emphasizes that across networking, security, collaboration and the cloud, its evolving intent-based technologies are constantly learning and adapting to provide customers with a highly secure, intelligent platform for their digital business, and it is transitioning its business model toward increased software and subscription revenue—evidenced by a 50 percent increase to $5.0 billion in product deferred revenue from recurring software and subscription offerings, driven by wireless (Meraki), security (advanced threat, web and unified threat management), collaboration (Webex SaaS) and IoT products following its Jasper and AppDynamics acquisitions. The company’s strategic priorities include accelerating innovation, increasing network value through automation, security and analytics, and delivering technology in customer-preferred consumption models, supported by ongoing R&D investments, value-engineering initiatives and targeted acquisitions when internal development cannot meet market timelines. Cisco continues to invest aggressively in security, IoT, collaboration, next-generation data center and cloud, while adapting its manufacturing and supply chain to secure constrained memory supply and optimize lead times in support of current order activity. A market transition from blade to rack-based computing and growth in its hyperconverged HyperFlex offering reflect its focus on operational flexibility, IT architecture enhancement and dynamic capability development, and service gross margin improvement has been driven by higher sales volume, favorable mix and increased software support offerings, with technical support services growing through renewals and new contract initiations and advanced services expanding to meet specific customer network needs. Its strong cash, cash equivalents and investment portfolio enable strategic technology investments and acquisitions that further strengthen its IT capabilities and competitive positioning.

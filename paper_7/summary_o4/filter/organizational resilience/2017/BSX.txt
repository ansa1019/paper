Boston Scientific is actively integrating acquired businesses into its core operations—completing the integration of EndoChoice into its Endoscopy segment and expecting to substantially complete the integration of Symetis into its Interventional Cardiology business by the end of 2018—demonstrating its ability to mobilize and reconfigure resources and processes in support of strategic objectives. The company has increased its investment in infrastructure across emerging markets to maximize opportunities and has driven cost reductions and enhanced operational efficiency through targeted process improvement and restructuring programs. Many of its cardiac rhythm management offerings combine devices with the Latitude patient management system, deferring revenue on the undelivered service element and allocating arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method, which reflects an information-systems-enabled service delivery capability that relies on estimates of selling price and fair value. Management supplements GAAP measures with non-GAAP financial measures—excluding items such as amortization, impairment charges, restructuring and litigation costs—to evaluate performance period over period, assess underlying business trends, allocate resources, set operational goals and benchmark against competitors, underscoring its deployment of financial, operational and information resources to enhance decision-making. Additionally, the company invests in property, plant and equipment, strategic investments and short-term financial instruments, leverages credit facilities and a commercial paper program, and employs accounts receivable factoring and receivables de-recognition to manage liquidity, risk and resource allocation.

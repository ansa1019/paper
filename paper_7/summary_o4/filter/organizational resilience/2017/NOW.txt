ServiceNow’s annual report describes its IT capability through its role as a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions that “define, structure, manage and automate services for global enterprises,” offering subscription-based access to a scalable platform delivered over a network of data centers, with related hosting, support services, data backup and disaster recovery capabilities and ongoing software updates. The Company “continues to invest in the development of our services, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth,” adding and expanding data centers and interconnectivity to improve utilization and economies of scale, and deploying both physical hardware and intangible assets—such as platform software, management skills and business process understanding—through its research and development organization. Subscription revenues are recognized ratably over contract terms beginning on the service commencement date, while professional services for process design, implementation, configuration and optimization are recognized as delivered, reflecting the firm’s ability to deploy and combine IT resources in support of customer work processes and business strategies. Cost of subscription revenues “consists primarily of expenses related to hosting our services and providing support to our customers,” including data center capacity costs, depreciation of infrastructure hardware dedicated for customer use, amortization of intangible assets and personnel-related costs directly associated with data center operations and customer support, while research and development and general and administrative expenses include depreciation and amortization of hardware and software used for service development and corporate operations. Deferred commissions are capitalized and amortized over contract periods to align selling costs with revenue recognition, underscoring the mobilization of sales-force capabilities in conjunction with IT-enabled offerings. The Company expects that incremental infrastructure and headcount investments will continue to support subscription growth at a faster rate than cost increases, thereby enhancing gross profit margins and leveraging existing IT architecture for sustained competitive advantage.

Procter & Gamble has centralized its enabling technology and information management under its Global Business Services (GBS) organization, which “provides technology, processes and standard data tools to enable the GBUs, the SMOs and corporate functions to better understand the business and better serve consumers and customers” and is charged with “providing world-class solutions at a low cost and with minimal capital investment.” Throughout the MD&A, management relies on vendor-reported consumption and market size data alongside internal estimates to track market share and consumption, and it defines non-GAAP metrics such as organic sales growth, core EPS and adjusted free cash flow to provide investors and management with information on underlying trends and performance. The company’s multi-year productivity and cost savings plans encompass supply chain optimization, outsourcing projects (including service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management) and streamlining overhead and work processes; the benefits of these initiatives are reinvested in product and packaging improvements, brand marketing, expanded sales coverage and R&D. Capital spending is described as primarily supporting capacity expansion, innovation and cost efficiencies, reflecting an ongoing commitment to mobilizing and deploying technology and data resources in support of business strategies and processes.

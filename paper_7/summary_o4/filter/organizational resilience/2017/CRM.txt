We have continued to evolve our IT capabilities by expanding our enterprise cloud computing platform—introduced in 2000 for customer relationship management—through new editions, features and platform capabilities across cloud, mobile, social, Internet of Things and artificial intelligence technologies. Our customer success platform – which includes sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, digital commerce, community management, industry-specific clouds, analytics, application development, IoT integration, collaborative productivity tools, the AppExchange enterprise marketplace and professional cloud services – provides scalable, secure, multi-tenant IT resources designed to coordinate our assets and internal processes with interfirm transactions and relationships, delivering data and information with the appropriate accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access and tailoring these elements in response to changing business needs. Key strategic initiatives to strengthen our IT capabilities include extending existing service offerings, reducing customer attrition, expanding and bolstering our partner ecosystem, encouraging third-party application development on our platform, and expanding into new markets, supported by the continued expansion of our data center capacity both internally and through third-party providers, investments in database software and hardware, and enhancements to our global infrastructure and security measures. We also regularly evaluate acquisitions and investments—such as our acquisition of Demandware—to integrate complementary technologies, augment our commerce cloud, AI and analytics offerings and drive innovation organically. Our ongoing research and development efforts focus on adding new features, integrating acquired technologies, increasing functionality and security, and enhancing ease of use, all enabled by our proprietary, scalable multi-tenant architecture. In parallel, we capitalize qualifying internal-use software costs under ASC 350, defer and amortize commission payments over contract terms, and recognize subscription and support revenues ratably, accounting practices that reflect our ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources in support of business strategies and work processes. These investments and practices underscore our competence to mobilize IT-based resources in combination with other organizational capabilities, thereby reinforcing our operational flexibility, process optimization, market responsiveness and competitive advantage in a dynamic digital environment.

In 2017 and 2016, Schwab’s operating expenses notably reflected its ongoing investments in information technology capabilities: professional services expense increased primarily due to higher spending on technology projects and third-party technology fees tied to growth in its asset management business; occupancy and equipment expense grew as a result of increased software maintenance expense relating to information technology systems; and depreciation and amortization rose due to higher amortization of internally developed software associated with investments in software and technology enhancements. Capital expenditures increased to $412 million in 2017 (from $353 million in 2016 and $285 million in 2015), with the largest component—$157 million in 2017—attributed to capitalized costs for developing internal-use software, reflecting the firm’s focus on enhancing its digital infrastructure and supporting geographic expansion. Schwab maintains a robust business continuity and disaster recovery architecture—including backup facilities, communications redundancy, a geographically dispersed workforce, and routine testing of recovery plans—to ensure the resiliency of its critical business functions and technology systems. The company has also designed and implemented a comprehensive information security program that integrates complementary tools, controls and technologies to protect systems, client accounts and data; employs advanced monitoring systems to identify suspicious activity; limits employee access to non-public information; enforces internal authentication measures; and provides regular training on data security. To manage third-party technology and processing risk, Schwab enforces contractual provisions, control standards, ongoing performance monitoring, and appropriate testing. Finally, Schwab cites its ability to develop and launch new products, services and capabilities in a timely and successful manner as a key component of its competitive positioning and market leadership.

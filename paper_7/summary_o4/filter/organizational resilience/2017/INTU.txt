In our MD&A we describe a dynamic and highly competitive market for software and related services—particularly highly-available connected services—driven by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs and the global shift from traditional paper-based services to web-enabled offerings, which underpins our strategic focus on connected services across all businesses. As we continue transitioning to connected services, the ongoing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems, and those of our external service providers, has become increasingly important. We are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities to support the hosting, collection, use and retention of personal customer information, mitigate fraud risks and maintain compliance. We derive revenue from hosted services and online ecosystem offerings—including QuickBooks Online, online payroll and payment processing—and reflect related costs as data center and support expenses in cost of service and other revenue. Starting with the 2015 release of QuickBooks desktop products, we deliver ongoing enhancements and connected services over an extended service period, recognizing revenue as services are provided, illustrating our ability to deploy and reconfigure IT resources to align with evolving business processes and strategic objectives.

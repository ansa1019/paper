Our capital expenditure program for fiscal 2019 contemplates approximately $800 million of investment in offices and distribution centers, including buying and merchandising systems and information systems to support growth, in addition to approximately $400 million for store renovations and $200 million for new stores, reflecting the firmâ€™s ongoing deployment and reconfiguration of technology resources to enhance business processes and supply chain efficiency. Net sales from our e-commerce businesses, including tjmaxx.com, tkmaxx.com and sierratradingpost.com, represented approximately 2 percent of total sales in fiscal 2018, underscoring the role of our digital infrastructure and connectivity capabilities in meeting changing consumer preferences and expanding market reach. We continue to open new distribution centers, which has driven higher supply chain costs, and have seen corresponding systems and technology costs included in general corporate expenses to support these initiatives. Our liquidity and capital resources section notes that we believe our credit facilities and internally generated funds, along with robust information management capabilities, are more than adequate to meet operating needs, while note A to the consolidated financial statements describes investments in buying and merchandising systems and information systems as core aspects of our strategy to coordinate assets, internal processes and interfirm transactions in support of organizational goals.

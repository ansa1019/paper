In 2017, we announced strategic growth initiatives with an emphasis on growing earnings and returns and committed to continue making investments in technology and talent while exploring new opportunities; accordingly, non-compensation expenses increased, reflecting higher technology costs, including cloud-based services and software depreciation, and our total staff rose 6% as of year-end, driven in part by investments in technology and our Marcus digital lending and deposit platform to support evolving business needs, regulatory obligations and enhanced operational flexibility.

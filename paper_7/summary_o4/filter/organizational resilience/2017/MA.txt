Mastercard describes itself as a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners and other organizations worldwide via its global payments processing network, which facilitates the switching (authorization, clearing and settlement) of electronic payment transactions and delivers related products and services. Its recent acquisition of Vocalink has expanded its capability to process automated clearing house transactions and enabled a multi-rail network offering a single partner solution for both domestic and cross-border payment needs. The company provides value-added offerings—including safety and security products, information services and consulting, loyalty and reward programs, issuer and acquirer processing and real-time account-based payment services—leveraging digital infrastructure such as mobile and e-commerce gateways. Connectivity fees charged to customers for network access, equipment and message transmission, together with data processing and telecommunications charges to support its global network infrastructure and computer systems, reflect investments in technology resources and capacity growth. Transaction processing systems accumulate transactional information to calculate gross dollar and euro volumes, while Mastercard Advisors applies data analytics and research capabilities to generate consulting and information-service revenues. These combined IT-enabled resources support the firm’s ability to provide timely, reliable and secure information, tailor services in response to evolving business needs, optimize operational efficiency, manage foreign exchange transactional impacts and continually enhance its network and service offerings to sustain competitive advantage and drive business transformation.

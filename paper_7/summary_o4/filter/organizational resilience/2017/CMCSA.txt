In 2017, we increased investments in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity; continued to deploy set-top boxes for our Internet Protocol (“IP”) and cloud-enabled X1 video platform and cloud DVR technology; expanded deployment of wireless gateways combining a customer’s wireless router, cable modem and voice adapter to improve the performance of multiple IP-enabled devices and create an in-home Wi-Fi network; and broadened our network of residential, outdoor and business Wi-Fi hotspots to approximately 18.8 million, enabling customers to access our high-speed Internet services inside and outside the home. Technical and product support expenses rose primarily due to development, deployment and support of our X1 platform, cloud DVR technology and wireless gateways, as well as network operations, product development, fulfillment and provisioning activities. Customer service expenses reflected increased support for improving the customer experience and sales and support activities associated with the deployment of our X1 platform and wireless gateways, along with growth in business services and security and automation services. Capital expenditures in our cable communications segment increased 4.7% to $8.0 billion, driven by network capacity expansion, line extensions for business services and continued investment in customer premise equipment and software, which in turn drove higher depreciation and amortization expense. Other revenue increased, in part, due to revenue from our security and automation services and our X1 licensing agreements. Our cable networks and broadcast television segments include various digital properties, generating revenue from distribution and licensing across digital platforms. To address intensifying competition and shifting consumer behaviors toward online viewing, we are responding through our X1 platform and sales and marketing programs, such as promotions and bundled service offerings, to enhance connectivity, operational flexibility and market responsiveness.

The company’s MD&A highlights its role as a leading global provider of financial services technology, offering account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, internet and mobile banking systems and related software solutions to more than 12,000 clients, and notes that the rapid evolution of digital channels and growing transaction volumes have intensified data and transaction processing needs, prompting financial institutions to invest substantial capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information, maintain regulatory compliance and deliver innovative new services. It explains that it anticipates benefiting from the industry’s shift from in-house technology to outsourced, scale-based infrastructure and networks to stay current on technology changes, and emphasizes the importance of economies of scale in developing and maintaining technology infrastructure, software applications and data communication systems to achieve competitive advantage. As part of its enterprise priorities, the company is differentiating its products and services through innovation and integration, making incremental investments in innovation-based solutions that affect operating margins, and has acquired online banking solutions, internet-based mortgage software, bank payments and liquidity management solutions and a digital banking experience platform to enrich its digital leadership and transform payments infrastructure. The cost of processing and services explicitly includes infrastructure costs to maintain software applications and data communications, and its capital expenditure strategy continues to fund technology infrastructure alongside other uses of operating cash flow.

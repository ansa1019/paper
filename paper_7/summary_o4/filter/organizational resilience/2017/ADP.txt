During fiscal 2017, ADP continued to mobilize and deploy IT‐based resources through sustained investments in product innovation and cloud‐based human capital management platforms, strengthening its underlying business model by upgrading clients from legacy platforms to new cloud solutions and aligning client service operations with strategic platforms via a multi‐year service alignment initiative that incurred charges related to dual operations. The company’s systems development and programming costs rose 4% to develop, support and maintain its products and strategic projects, reflecting increased IT investment and capitalized project costs. ADP’s implementation team and service organization leveraged enhanced technology functionalities, data management and management skills to drive revenue growth and improve pays‐per‐control performance metrics, while the acquisition of the Marcus Buckingham Company augmented its digital talent management capabilities. Continuous investments in the sales organization and disciplined capital expenditures of $249.1 million in 2017 (with approximately $200 million expected in 2018) underpinned ongoing technology deployment, process automation, operational flexibility and secure connectivity essential to support business strategies and regulatory compliance. Additionally, the firm’s revenue recognition and client funds management processes rely on information timeliness, accuracy and secure data flows to collect, hold and remit payroll and tax funds, supported by a diversified investment portfolio and short‐term financing arrangements to optimize liquidity, risk management and regulatory governance. This strategic alignment of organizational resources, technological infrastructure and financial decisions facilitates innovation, enhances operational efficiency and positions ADP’s evolving IT capability as a competitive enabler of business transformation, client value creation and long-term growth.

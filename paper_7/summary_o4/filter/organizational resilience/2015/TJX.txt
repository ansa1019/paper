In fiscal 2016, the company continued to generate strong cash flows, enabling value returns through dividends and share repurchases while reinvesting in its business by adding and remodeling stores and strengthening infrastructure to support growth, thereby deploying resources to maintain operations under dynamic conditions. To mitigate the impact of sudden and significant foreign currency exchange fluctuations on merchandise purchases, the company routinely entered into inventory-related hedging instruments and recognized mark-to-market gains or losses that are later offset as inventory is received, exemplifying risk-mitigation strategies that preserve operating margins under pressure. The deliberate merchandise mix and pricing strategy, which yielded a lower average ticket to drive strong increases in customer traffic and units sold, demonstrated operational flexibility and adaptive response to market turbulence. Liquidity management relied on internally generated funds, supplemented by credit facilities and commercial paper, and the company affirmed that existing cash balances and facilities were adequate to meet forthcoming needs, reflecting preparedness and resourcefulness. Forward-looking capital expenditure plans of approximately $1.1 billion—allocated across offices and distribution centers, store renovations and new store openings—along with the centralization of support areas and the acquisition of Trade Secret in Australia, underscored strategic foresight, resource allocation and investment in organizational capabilities. Governance and resilience were further supported by periodic evaluations of long-lived asset recoverability, mark-to-market assessments of derivatives, actuarial assumptions for retirement obligations and reserves for uncertain tax positions, evidencing proactive mitigation of potential impairments. Additionally, the implementation of a phased wage initiative for U.S. hourly store associates illustrated attention to human capital sustainability under evolving operational demands.

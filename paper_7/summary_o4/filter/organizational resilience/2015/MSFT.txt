In fiscal year 2015, Microsoft pursued a series of transformational and adaptive actions aimed at maintaining performance amid evolving market conditions, including implementing organizational changes and making strategic and tactical moves to support its mobile-first, cloud-first strategy, supplementing its capabilities through 16 acquisitions to strengthen its cloud platform and invest in mobile applications, advancing Windows 10 development via the Windows Insider program to incorporate unprecedented levels of user and developer feedback, and investing in new products and services—which drove a 6% increase in research and development expenses and higher datacenter capacity to serve growing cloud demand. The company restructured its phone hardware business, recording $7.5 billion of goodwill and asset impairment charges and $2.5 billion of integration and restructuring expenses in response to underperforming operations, while also reinvesting in Surface devices, enterprise mobility services and productivity offerings that contributed to triple-digit growth in Azure revenue and significant increases in Office 365 commercial and consumer subscriptions. Operating in a dynamic, highly competitive environment, Microsoft emphasized the need to evolve and adapt in pace with changing customer preferences and technology trends, managing risk from foreign currency fluctuations that have negatively impacted revenue and expenses, and leveraging its global talent pool through selective recruitment and retention practices. The company’s ongoing investments in infrastructure and expanded distribution, combined with capital allocation through share repurchases and targeted acquisitions, reflect a systemic focus on reconfiguring resources and capabilities to preserve integrity and performance under external pressures, thereby supporting business continuity, future orientation, and resilience.

In 2015, AMD faced a challenging business environment marked by global macro-economic volatility, competitive pressures and reduced OEM demand, which led to significant declines in net revenue and gross margin; nevertheless, the Company absorbed strain and preserved functioning under these adverse conditions by focusing on resource allocation and operational flexibility, including the introduction of a more diverse product portfolio—such as its 6th generation A-series mobile processors, new graphics architectures and embedded SoC solutions—to confront disruptive change and sustain competitive advantage. Concurrently, AMD continued to simplify its structure and better align resources around its priorities and business outlook through its 2015 restructuring plan, which provided for approximately a 5% workforce reduction, outsourcing of certain IT services and application development, real estate consolidation and associated workforce rebalancing, yielding operational savings and preserving organizational health. To ensure business continuity across its supply chain, the Company entered into joint ventures for assembly, testing, marking, packing and packaging services and negotiated successive amendments to its wafer supply agreement with GlobalFoundries, thereby securing fixed pricing, volume commitments and transition support to mitigate risk and maintain system integrity. AMD also managed financial resources through debt issuances and repurchases, maintained a secured revolving line of credit to support liquidity and capital expenditures, and responsibly managed cash and marketable securities balances to navigate environmental perturbations, demonstrating both recovery and transformation strategies that reflect the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions and underscore the Company’s commitment to preserve or improve performance while projecting future resilience.

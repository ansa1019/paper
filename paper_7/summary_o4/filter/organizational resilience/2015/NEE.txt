Nee and its subsidiaries maintain business continuity and operational flexibility through diversified liquidity sources—including cash flow from operations, borrowings, short- and long-term debt issuances, equity securities and differential membership investor proceeds—which resulted in NextEra Energy’s total net available liquidity of $7.7 billion as of December 31, 2015 (with FPL’s portion at $3.1 billion) and bank revolving credit facilities maturing through 2021. FPL’s ability to absorb up to approximately $119 million in future prudently incurred storm restoration costs without seeking regulatory rate adjustments, together with the deferral of mark-to-market gains and losses on energy derivatives as regulatory assets or liabilities until settlement, exemplifies embedded risk mitigation mechanisms and the preservation of performance under external disturbances. Management’s use of adjusted earnings—excluding unrealized hedge impacts, OTTI reversals and nonrecurring items—for internal planning, board reporting and performance-based compensation illustrates positive adjustment processes under challenging conditions and a focus on fundamental earnings power. Strategic initiatives such as the modernization of the Port Everglades power plant, replacement of aging gas turbines, reinforcement of transmission and distribution infrastructure, development of three solar PV projects and FPL’s expected construction of a new 1,600 MW natural gas–fired unit reflect deliberate resource reconfiguration, operational agility and adaptation to environmental turbulence. NEER’s addition of approximately 1,207 MW of wind capacity and 285 MW of solar capacity in the U.S., expansion of its renewable development project backlog, investment in natural gas pipelines and the formation of NextEra Energy Partners to acquire and manage contracted clean energy projects with stable, long-term cash flows demonstrate forward-looking resilience strategies and resource deployment toward sustainable growth. Furthermore, guarantee arrangements, letters of credit, surety bonds, indemnifications, master netting agreements and established counterparty credit limits underpin supply chain resilience and credit risk management, while value-at-risk modeling for commodity, interest rate and equity exposures and compliance with regulatory accounting for asset retirement obligations and nuclear decommissioning funds convey a systemic approach to maintaining organizational integrity and performance amidst internal or external variations and disturbances.

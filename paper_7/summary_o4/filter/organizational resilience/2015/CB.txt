Chubb’s risk management framework and capital structure are designed to preserve operating continuity and positive performance under a wide range of internal and external pressures by maintaining a substantial capital base, diversified and highly liquid investment portfolios, extensive reinsurance protection, and robust liquidity facilities to meet unforeseen claim demands. The company actively monitors catastrophe risk accumulation worldwide, modeling probable maximum losses on U.S. earthquake and hurricane events, and regularly reviews and renews its multi-layer global property catastrophe and terrorism reinsurance programs, including structural features such as loss sharing, deductibles, transaction limits, and waiting periods to cap loss severity and support business continuity. Reserve committees comprising senior management, actuarial, underwriting, claims, and finance professionals perform quarterly and at least annual reviews of unpaid loss and loss expense reserves using a combination of paid and reported loss development, expected loss ratio, and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods, together with scenario and sensitivity analyses, to ensure the best estimate of ultimate liabilities and maintain system integrity amid volatility. The company’s corporate structure and profit-center autonomy facilitate rapid decision-making, resource allocation, product innovation, and integration of acquisitions, while global credit limits, collateral arrangements, derivative hedges on variable annuity guarantees, and multi-currency notional cash pooling programs enhance financial flexibility and operational resilience. Chubb complements these measures with extensive reinsurance audit processes, stress-testing, explicit risk transfer assessments for structured products, and continuous monitoring of reinsurer credit quality, thereby reinforcing its absorptive capacity and adaptability to extreme conditions, disruptions, and evolving market volatility.

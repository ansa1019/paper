We monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues, undertaking various restructuring actions over the past several years that we expect will result in estimated annual cost savings and enable additional investments in products; we maintain cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor credit exposure and diversify our investments to minimize credit risk and believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, dividend payments and stock repurchases in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months; we amended and restated our senior unsecured revolving credit facility to enable borrowing of up to $750.0 million and, in conjunction with a major acquisition, entered into and fully repaid a 90-day term loan facility to finance the transaction, demonstrating our operational flexibility in response to external pressures; we defer revenue recognition from sales to distributors until the distributors have sold the products to their customers to address uncertainties related to price-adjustment credits and product returns; we value inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market and record write-downs for obsolescence based on the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations informed by future demand estimates; we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, when appropriate, for estimated losses resulting from customer credit deterioration; we review property, plant, and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying values may not be recoverable, determining recoverability by comparing carrying values to future undiscounted cash flows and recognizing impairment charges when fair value is lower; we test goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting-unit level, comparing fair values derived from discounted cash flow and other valuation methodologies to carrying amounts and recognizing any shortfall as an impairment loss; in business combinations we recognize tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values and record any excess consideration as goodwill, while contingent consideration is measured at fair value on the acquisition date and remeasured each reporting period with changes recognized in operating expenses; we account for uncertain tax positions by determining if it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained and record benefits only when that threshold is met; we expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $140 million to $160 million funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations; and we determine the payment of future dividends and any stock repurchase activity based on factors including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity, thereby preserving our ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

During fiscal 2015, Lowe’s pursued initiatives to maintain operational integrity and performance under external pressures by enhancing omni-channel capabilities—improving product search, integrated product videos, presentation and simplified groupings on lowes.com—and expanding in-home selling networks with interior and exterior project specialists in all U.S. stores; by reconfiguring store environments through collaboration among merchants, stores and a customer experience design team to showcase outdoor living and holiday décor experiences; and by optimizing payroll hours against customer traffic, deploying targeted advertising spend via optimized media allocation, expanded digital and social channels, reduced print advertising and leveraging scale for cost savings on indirect spend. The company’s strategic portfolio adjustments included a $530 million non-cash impairment charge to exit its Australian joint venture—based on an income approach using projected discounted cash flows and comparable transaction multiples—and the announcement of a definitive agreement to acquire Rona Inc., financed via the debt capital markets with a C$ purchase option, illustrating resource reallocation and adaptation to evolving market conditions. Liquidity management relied on $4.8 billion of operating cash flow, a $1.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facility supporting a commercial paper program, unsecured note issuances and currency hedges; debt covenants and ratings were monitored to preserve financial flexibility and continuity. Risk mitigation practices encompassed anticipatory inventory reserves for obsolescence ($46 million) and shrinkage ($171 million); self-insurance liabilities determined actuarially ($883 million); deferred revenues for extended protection plans ($729 million) and unsettled customer transactions ($619 million); and quarterly impairment testing of long-lived assets (recording $8 million of impairment losses) and equity method investments. With a capital expenditure forecast of approximately $1.5 billion—allocated across store expansion, remerchandising, technology and distribution network investments—and a $3.5 billion share repurchase program alongside dividends of $991 million, the company demonstrated proactive measures to absorb strain, sustain operational flexibility and emerge stronger from challenging circumstances.

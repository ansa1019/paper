In the year ended December 31, 2015, the company continued to focus on investments in targeted financial assets, divesting selected non‐core assets, reducing its real estate portfolio and increasing shareholder return, thereby reinforcing operational flexibility and preserving performance under evolving market conditions. The company committed to and initiated an active program to sell J.D. Power, classified its assets and liabilities as held for sale and determined that the anticipated disposal does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on operations and financial results. In pursuit of sustainable growth, management has aligned its efforts against two key strategic priorities—creating growth and driving performance—pledging to “strive to deliver operational excellence, manage and mitigate risk and enhance leadership and accountability.” Products and services are to be delivered through customer‐centric distribution channels that enable mission-critical decisions, while cost containment efforts—such as compensation cost reductions stemming from 2014 restructuring actions and identified operating efficiencies—have been implemented to safeguard profitability. The acquisition of SNL in September 2015 was executed to create scale, synergies and diversification of data, technology and commercial capabilities, and the consolidation of the corporate headquarters in New York City was completed to streamline infrastructure and reallocate resources more efficiently. The company maintains a strong financial position, expecting that cash on hand, cash flows from operations and availability under its $1.2 billion credit facility will be sufficient to meet additional operating and recurring cash needs. In its S&P Ratings segment, management adapted to market volatility by monitoring issuance volumes, applying constant-currency comparisons to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange rates, containing legal and regulatory settlement costs and completing prior restructuring, all of which contributed to improved operating profit. Across all segments, the company will continue to seek growth by further penetrating core customer sets and geographies, enhancing core capabilities in data, technology and market approach, investing in digital capabilities to integrate its brands more deeply in customer workflows, diversifying its index offerings through asset class expansion, emerging-market initiatives and strategic partnerships, and proactively responding to evolving regulatory requirements—including implementation of Dodd-Frank changes and preparation for forthcoming European Benchmark Regulation and MiFID II—to preserve system integrity and competitive advantage.

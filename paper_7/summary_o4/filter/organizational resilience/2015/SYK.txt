Stryker maintains separate dedicated sales forces for each principal product line to provide focus and expertise and collaborates with customers to develop innovative products and services, committing to internal innovation complemented by focused acquisitions, which support its ability to adjust positively under fluctuating market demand and deliver improved outcomes and cost efficiencies. It evaluates and deploys its financial resources through disciplined capital allocation, prioritizing operating cash flow to fund operating needs and capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases while retaining access to debt markets and credit facilities for supplementary funding, demonstrating preparedness to absorb liquidity strains and maintain business continuity. The company’s global cash management strategy, geographic diversification of manufacturing facilities and use of designated forward currency exchange contracts and net investment hedges mitigate foreign currency exposures, thereby preserving performance despite exchange rate volatility. Stryker continually assesses its receivables, maintains inventory reserves for excess and obsolete stock based on historical experience and expected trends, and records contingent liabilities for product recalls, legal claims and uncertain tax positions based on best estimates, ensuring resource reconfiguration and operational flexibility in the face of adverse events. Its critical accounting policies and periodic impairment reviews of intangible assets and goodwill reflect systematic evaluation of recoverability and fair value under changing economic conditions, and its adoption of non-GAAP measures to exclude irregular items from core operating results supports trend analysis and management incentive alignment. Together, these practices illustrate Stryker’s organizational resilience in preserving and enhancing functioning under diverse pressures, constraints and disruptions through strategic resource management, risk assessment, adaptive strategies and ongoing performance monitoring.

The Company continues to strengthen its ability to absorb strain and maintain operational performance under challenging conditions by scaling and reconfiguring its production, service and charging infrastructure worldwide, including transitioning to a new final assembly line, upgrading body and paint shops, adding stamping capacity, and expanding retail, service centers and supercharger networks to support increasing vehicle deliveries.  Significant material cost reductions from engineering and commercial actions and manufacturing efficiencies have improved Model S gross margin, while ongoing process‐improvement initiatives are expected to further enhance automotive margins and support profitability goals.  To ensure business continuity and resource deployment for future growth, the Company is investing approximately $1.5 billion in 2016 capital expenditures to equip the Gigafactory for cell production, install Model 3 manufacturing machinery, open about 80 new retail and service locations and energize about 300 supercharger sites, leveraging a $1 billion revolving credit facility and convertible debt issuances structured with hedges and warrants.  Working capital and liquidity management measures include collecting fully refundable customer deposits totaling $283.4 million, assessing resale value guarantees and lease portfolios for residual value and credit risk, recording inventory write‐downs based on demand forecasts, accruing warranty costs using historical and projected claims data, and continuously evaluating critical accounting estimates, tax positions and contractual obligations to preserve system integrity and support resilience in the face of supply chain complexity, market volatility and potential project delays.

Mastercard continues to monitor political and economic conditions around the world to identify opportunities for the continued growth of our business and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry, and while the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries, the significant concentration of our revenue generated in the United States makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the United States. The company attempts to manage these foreign currency exposures through its foreign exchange risk management activities, recognizing the positive or negative translation impact on operating expenses and gross dollar volume. We need liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations, credit and settlement exposure, capital expenditures, investments in our business and current and potential obligations, and accordingly in October 2015 we entered into a committed unsecured $3.75 billion revolving credit facility and in November established a $3.75 billion commercial paper program, which may be used, among other purposes, for business continuity planning. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment securities balances, cash flow generating capabilities, borrowing capacity and access to capital resources are sufficient to satisfy our future operating cash needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations and potential obligations. Mastercard excludes special items because its management monitors significant one-time items separately from ongoing operations and evaluates ongoing performance without these amounts; Mastercard’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate its ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. We acquired two businesses for $609 million, which focus on expanding our footprint and enhancing critical capabilities, including in the area of data analytics, completed a €1.65 billion debt offering, repurchased 38 million shares of our class A common stock for $3.5 billion and continue to work with issuers, merchants and governments to help deploy standards for safe and secure transactions for the global payments system. The company guarantees the settlement of many Mastercard, Cirrus and Maestro-branded transactions between our issuers and acquirers; historically, payments under these guarantees have not been significant, but historical trends may not be an indication of the future. The company regularly reviews the status of each significant legal or regulatory matter, assesses potential financial exposure and, if the potential loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Additionally, Mastercard monitors information security risks, recognizing that although no material impacts relating to cyber-attacks or security breaches have occurred to date, there can be no assurance against future losses.

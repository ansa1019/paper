The discussion describes a range of measures and resource allocations the company has undertaken to preserve and improve performance despite economic, regulatory and environmental disturbances, reflecting the “maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” as defined by Vogus & Sutcliffe.  Foremost among these is the use of derivative instruments and forward contracts to hedge short-term currency fluctuations and the indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings to safeguard financial flexibility under shifting tax regimes.  The company also reports the continuous expansion and more consistent inclusion of its accommodation inventory, sustained investment in marketing, technology and personnel even when such expenditures put pressure on operating margins, and the rapid development of mobile platforms and partner-facing analytics tools to adapt to evolving consumer behaviors.  It maintains accruals for contingent liabilities such as travel-transaction tax disputes, monitors sovereign-debt and macro-economic risks, and stresses the difficulties of forecasting amid volatility in exchange rates, commodity prices, geopolitical tensions, health concerns and natural disasters.  Strategic initiatives including mergers, acquisitions and the establishment of a multi-currency revolving credit facility further underpin the organization’s ability to absorb strain, reconfigure resource deployment and maintain system integrity and continuity under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

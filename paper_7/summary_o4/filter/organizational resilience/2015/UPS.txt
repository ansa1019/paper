As a result of these circumstances, we continued to adjust our air capacity and cost structure in our transportation network to better match the prevailing volume levels, and our broad portfolio of product offerings and the flexibilities inherent in our transportation network have helped us adapt to these changing trends. While the worldwide economic environment remained challenging in 2015, we have continued to undertake several initiatives in the U.S. and internationally to improve the flexibility and capacity in our transportation network, improve yield management, and increase operational efficiency and contain costs across all segments. Most notably, the continued deployment of technology improvements—including several facility automation projects and the accelerated deployment of our on-road integrated optimization and navigation system (“Orion”)—should increase our network capacity, and improve operational efficiency, flexibility and reliability, and we have continued to utilize newly expanded operating facilities to improve time-in-transit for shipments in each region. Productivity improvements have continued to be realized through adjusting our air and ground networks to better match volume levels and utilizing technology to increase package sorting and delivery efficiency; the continued deployment of Orion has contained the average daily vehicle miles driven (down 0.4%) even as package volume increased (up 1.8%), and ongoing modifications to our air network restrained growth in aircraft block hours (down 1.1%) while enabling a 3.2% increase in international export volume and service enhancements. Excluding the impact of currency exchange rate changes, the total adjusted cost per piece for the international package segment decreased 4.0% in 2015, and overall we processed increased volume (up 6.4%) at a faster rate than the increase in average daily aircraft block hours (up 2.4%) and vehicle miles driven (up 4.2%). In our supply chain & freight operations, disciplined revenue management initiatives, network efficiency improvements and targeted investments in technology and infrastructure were used to contain costs, while the integration of acquisitions such as Coyote Logistics and expansions in healthcare and aerospace solutions supported service innovation. We believe these adjusted non-GAAP financial measures—used for operating profit, operating margin and resource allocation—provide a systemic perspective on resource deployment and trends in our underlying businesses. Seasonal volume fluctuations and adverse weather conditions were managed through capacity adjustments, productivity enhancements and claims management initiatives, resulting in boundary containment of cost per piece and stabilization of operating margins. Fuel expense declines due to lower prices were managed via fuel efficiency measures, hedging activities and alternative fuel credits, mitigating the impact of external pressures on operating costs. Capital expenditures on technology, vehicles and facility expansions were funded primarily from operating cash flow, ensuring our ability to absorb strain and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Liquidity was supported by funds from operations and borrowing programs to meet long-term needs, while share repurchase and dividend strategies were executed without jeopardizing financial flexibility. Changes to multiemployer health and welfare benefit arrangements transferred legacy obligations and reduced volatility, and collective bargaining outcomes were settled in a manner that preserved operational continuity. These combined actions—network reconfiguration, productivity improvements, strategic resource allocation, investment in automation and technology, financial management, risk mitigation and benefit plan restructuring—exemplify our capacity to preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity.

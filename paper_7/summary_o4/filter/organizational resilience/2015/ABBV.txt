AbbVieâ€™s strategic focus on delivering strong financial results, advancing and investing in its pipeline, and returning value to shareholders while ensuring long-term sustainable growth underpins its ability to absorb strain and maintain performance under market pressures. The acquisition of Pharmacyclics, financed through $16.7 billion of senior notes and an accelerated share repurchase agreement, was integrated to accelerate its clinical and commercial presence, diversify its revenue base, and strengthen its pipeline, reflecting adaptive resource allocation and reconfiguration of capabilities. Cash flows from operations of $7.5 billion in 2015 funded dividends, share repurchases, capital expenditures including a new biologics facility, and licensing and collaboration payments, demonstrating operational flexibility and investment in future resilience. Productivity initiatives in supply chain and efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure and administrative costs are intended to expand gross and operating margins and leverage revenue growth. The company maintains diverse liquidity sources, including a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility, commercial paper, and the ability to issue debt, while rigorously monitoring economic conditions, customer creditworthiness, and government funding, and employing allowances and factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, thus preserving continuity and systemic integrity across financial and operational domains. AbbVie also structures milestone-based R&D collaborations and license agreements to reconstitute and advance its mid- and late-stage pipeline assets, and continuously evaluates portfolio performance to reallocate resources, manage regulatory and market disruptions, and sustain innovation and organizational health despite external variations and pressures.

Consolidated revenues increased due to growth in global streaming average paying memberships, the majority of which was growth in our international memberships reflecting our expansion and focus on Netflix as a global internet TV network, and while operating income decreased 24% for 2015 as compared to 2014, this was due primarily to increased marketing and headcount costs to support our international expansion in addition to increased content expenses as we continue to acquire, license and produce content, including more Netflix Originals. We have built our own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the Internet and we continue to invest in technology and development—including testing, maintaining and modifying our user interface, our recommendation, merchandising and streaming delivery technology and infrastructure—to improve our service offerings and maintain performance under rising demand. Our primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, streaming delivery, marketing programs and payroll, and investments in original content require more cash upfront relative to licensed content; although we currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with our available funds, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next twelve months, to fund our continued content investments we are likely to raise additional capital in future periods. We define free cash flow as cash (used in) provided by operating and investing activities excluding the non-operational cash flows from purchases, maturities and sales of short-term investments because it measures the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities. Streaming content obligations increased $1.4 billion from $9.5 billion as of December 31, 2014 to $10.9 billion as of December 31, 2015, primarily due to multi-year commitments associated with the continued expansion of our exclusive and original programming. Our ability to obtain any additional financing to finance our international expansion or investment in original content will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing, and we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. We have entered into certain licenses with collective management organizations, and are currently involved in negotiations that involve accruals for estimated license fees which are adjusted based on changes in estimates; the results of these negotiations are uncertain and may be materially different from management’s estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions—including judgments about viewing patterns, amortization methods, tax audit outcomes and stock-based compensation inputs—that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, and we regularly review and adjust these estimates to preserve organizational integrity and performance in the face of internal and external pressures.

Oracle’s cloud offerings are designed to be rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to innovation; easily maintainable to reduce integration and testing work; and cost-effective by requiring lower upfront customer investment, integrating the software, hardware and services on the customers’ behalf in IT environments that we deploy, support and manage for the customer. In fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, we invested $5.5 billion, $5.2 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of products and services and to develop new products and services, focusing development efforts on improving the performance, operation and integration of these differing technologies to make them more cost-effective and easier to deploy, manage and maintain for our customers and to improve their computing performance relative to our competitors. Oracle engineered systems are core to our hardware offerings and are important elements of our data center and cloud computing offerings; these pre-integrated products are designed to integrate multiple Oracle technology components to work together to deliver improved performance, availability, security and operational efficiency relative to our competitors’ products, to be upgraded effectively and efficiently and to simplify maintenance cycles by providing a single solution for software patching. We engineer our hardware systems with virtualization and management capabilities to enable the rapid deployment and efficient management of cloud and on-premises IT infrastructures and design hardware products to seamlessly connect on-premises and cloud IT environments to further enable interoperability, interchangeability and extendibility. A selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy; we believe our acquisitions enhance the products and services that we can offer to customers, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our revenues and earnings, and increase stockholder value. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition. We continue to evolve hardware systems support processes that are intended to proactively identify and solve quality issues and to increase the amount of new and renewed hardware systems support contracts sold in connection with the sales of our hardware systems products. We maintain $54.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and $47.9 billion of working capital, conduct our debt, dividend and stock repurchase programs to preserve organizational flexibility, and believe that our available financial resources and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements, including funding future acquisitions and initiatives, thereby positioning the organization to absorb strain, reconfigure resources and preserve or improve functioning under varying internal or external pressures.

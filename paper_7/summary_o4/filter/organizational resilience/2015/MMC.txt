The company underscores its resilience by embedding comprehensive risk management activities—risk advice, risk transfer and risk control and mitigation solutions—across its two primary segments, deploying approximately 60,000 employees in more than 130 countries to absorb external pressures and preserve or enhance performance. It demonstrated operational flexibility by achieving 5% consolidated operating income growth in 2015 despite a slight GAAP revenue decrease and significant foreign exchange headwinds, reflecting the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Expense discipline was balanced against rising base salaries, incentive compensation and retirement benefit costs, partly offset by a $125 million net credit from the termination of the post-65 retiree medical reimbursement plan, while strategic capital allocation—including issuance of $500 million five-year and $600 million 10.5-year senior notes, amendment of a $1.5 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility, and a $2 billion share repurchase program—ensured liquidity and continuity. The company reconfigured its resource base through 21 acquisitions in 2015 and managed contingent consideration liabilities and indemnities to safeguard future performance. Liquidity management incorporated regular repatriation of foreign earnings—$800 million deemed permanently reinvested—and pension funding strategies designed to maintain at least 80% ERISA-funded status, complemented by amendments to U.S. and U.K. defined benefit plans to mitigate long-term obligations. Quarterly reviews of legal and tax contingencies enable proactive recognition of probable liabilities, and annual qualitative goodwill impairment assessments reinforce system integrity and partial maintenance of performance under internal and external variations. Together, these initiatives reflect dynamic capabilities, strategic foresight, resource reconfiguration and risk mitigation mechanisms that support the maintenance of system integrity and organizational functioning in volatile environments.

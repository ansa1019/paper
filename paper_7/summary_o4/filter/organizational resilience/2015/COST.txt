While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private label items; our investments in merchandise pricing can, from time to time, include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting near-term gross margin as a percentage of net sales; our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at the most competitive prices and to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” by consistently providing the most competitive values; while we believe that we have achieved successes in controlling costs historically, some significant costs are partially outside our control, most particularly health care and utility expenses, and with respect to expenses relating to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize the wages and benefits that they earn but rather to maintain compensation levels that are better than the industry average in order to reduce turnover and enhance employee satisfaction; because our business is operated on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the income statement, particularly gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income; we continue to invest in modernizing our information systems, which has led to increased depreciation and service contract costs but is expected to enhance our operational flexibility and centralized support capabilities; we believe that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future and maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes, with borrowing capacity of $407 million at August 30, 2015, of which $337 million is maintained by our international operations; we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that, in the opinion of management, have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition; we evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be fully recoverable; we use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a captive insurance subsidiary and participation in a reinsurance program, to provide for potential liabilities and assess those liabilities based on historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions; our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada and other international operating segments, though certain countries in the other international segment exhibit higher rates of square footage growth, lower wages and benefit costs as a percentage of country sales, and varying competitive conditions; we also achieve sales growth and geographic diversification by opening new warehouses and expanding our online business domestically and internationally, and our membership format is designed to reinforce member loyalty, provide continuing fee revenue, and materially influence our profitability through growth in membership base, executive member penetration and high renewal rates.

Abbott has pursued resilience through the execution of efficiency and cost improvement initiatives across its manufacturing, supply chain and global infrastructure, driving operating margin expansion by 120 basis points in 2015 and 200 basis points in 2014; it invested in three new manufacturing plants in China, India and the United States and formed a strategic alliance with Fonterra to meet emerging-market demand, while maintaining resource flexibility with a $9 billion bridge term loan facility and unused $5 billion credit lines to support strategic acquisitions. The company routinely analyzes historical rebate trends, adjusts reserves, verifies rebate claims and monitors customer credit worthiness to mitigate pricing and reimbursement pressures, and employs quarterly impairment reviews using undiscounted net cash flows to preserve the integrity of intangible assets. Abbott funds its defined benefit pension plans in line with actuarial discount rate assumptions, manages working capital to generate net operating cash flows that exceed capital expenditures and dividends, and implements share repurchase and dividend increases as part of its capital allocation strategy. Restructuring programs from 2012 through 2015 streamlined global manufacturing and commercial operations, resulting in employee-related severance charges and accelerated depreciation write-downs to sustain efficiency under shifting market conditions. Research and development spending is managed at approximately 6â€“7 percent of sales annually to balance investment in new products with financial prudence. In recognition of external disturbances, Abbott applies designated exchange rates for its highly inflationary Venezuela operations, acknowledging potential foreign currency revaluation losses while continuing to sell medically critical products. Additional resilience mechanisms include interest rate swap contracts to hedge debt obligations, accrual of uncertain tax benefits in accordance with ASC 450 and ASU 2015-17 to address evolving regulations, and ongoing evaluation of credit and liquidity resources to maintain performance and system integrity under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

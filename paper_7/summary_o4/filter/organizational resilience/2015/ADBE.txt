In fiscal 2015, we completed the acquisition of Fotolia and integrated it into our digital media segment, demonstrating our ability to reconfigure resources and preserve operational continuity under evolving market conditions. We base our critical accounting policies and estimates—such as revenue recognition, business combinations, goodwill impairment testing and income tax provisions—on historical experience and key assumptions, judgments and estimates that we evaluate on a regular basis to absorb strain from internal and external variations. The shift to our next-generation Creative Cloud subscription model has transformed our business model, delivering more recurring and predictable revenue, expanding our customer base through lower entry-point pricing and targeted promotions, and driving service innovation by building a marketplace for stock assets and deploying new mobile applications. We actively manage environmental and market volatility through our currency hedging program, interest rate swaps and a $1 billion revolving credit facility to mitigate foreign exchange and interest rate risks and ensure financial resource availability. Our deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue backlogs, along with annualized recurring revenue metrics, serve as performance indicators that inform future planning and reflect our systemic perspective on segment health. We have undertaken restructuring plans, including workforce reductions and facility consolidations, to realign our resources around strategic initiatives, enhance organizational flexibility and reduce operational brittleness. Investments in network and data center infrastructure support increasing subscription volumes, and strategic use of short-term investments, cash reserves and available credit underscores our preparedness to maintain integrity and performance in the face of economic, regulatory and technological uncertainties.

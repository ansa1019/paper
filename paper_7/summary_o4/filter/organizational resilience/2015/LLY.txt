The Company manages research and development spending across its portfolio of molecules so that a delay in or termination of any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in total R&D spending, thereby preserving overall functioning despite project-level failures. It believes that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets will be adequate to fund short-term borrowing needs and that cash provided by operating activities in the U.S. and planned repatriations of foreign earnings for which tax has been provided will be sufficient to fund domestic operating needs, dividends, share repurchases, and capital expenditures. In response to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values, the Company employs a controlled risk-management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments, strives to balance fixed and floating rate debt through interest rate derivatives, and enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the impact of exchange-rate volatility on assets and liabilities. It maintains U.S. wholesaler inventory at an average of approximately one month or less by regularly reviewing supply levels, adjusts sales-return, rebate, and discount accruals based on historical experience and contractual provisions, and records product liability reserves and legal defense costs based on complex judgments regarding probable outcomes, insurance coverage, and third-party indemnities. Defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit costs are determined using actuarially derived assumptions for discount rates and expected return on plan assets, with annual evaluations of market conditions and asset allocation to align funding strategies. The Company reviews long-lived and indefinite-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate carrying values may not be recoverable, recording losses when projected undiscounted cash flows are insufficient. In acquisitions and licensing transactions, management assesses whether the acquired set of activities constitutes a business combination or asset acquisition, measures assets and liabilities at fair value using income or market approaches, charges acquired in-process R&D to expense when no alternative use exists, and measures contingent consideration liabilities based on revenue forecasts and discount-rate assumptions. For 2016, the Company expects revenue growth from established and new products, gross margin of approximately 74 percent, research and development expenses of $4.8 billion to $5.0 billion, marketing, selling, and administrative expenses of $6.0 billion to $6.2 billion, capital expenditures of about $1.1 billion, and other-net income of up to $75 million, while noting that various risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.

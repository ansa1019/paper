The report emphasizes that Berkshire’s operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis, with essentially no centralized sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources functions and minimal headquarters involvement, a structure that supports operational flexibility and localized decision-making under challenging conditions. Senior corporate management retains responsibility for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and corporate governance practices, communicating a consistent strategic tone at the top while allowing subsidiaries autonomy to reconfigure resources and adapt to environmental perturbations. The insurance operations maintain extraordinary capital strength—statutory surplus of approximately $124 billion at year-end 2015—which provides a margin of safety, enables the negotiation of bespoke reinsurance contracts and absorbs strain from defined catastrophe losses, thereby preserving underwriting performance amid volatility. A prudent reserving philosophy—establishing case, case-development and IBNR reserves, defining pre-tax catastrophe losses above $100 million as significant and regularly updating ultimate loss estimates—mitigates risk and prevents organizational brittleness when internal or external variations occur. Liquidity management likewise prioritizes safety over yield, holding substantial cash and equivalents to maintain system integrity and operational continuity across market cycles. In the railroad segment, capacity expansion investments, targeted system-improvement initiatives and enhanced operational practices significantly improved velocity, on-time performance and service levels despite severe weather and demand shifts. The utilities and energy businesses operate under regulated rate frameworks designed to recover costs and provide returns, integrating newly acquired entities and pursuing disciplined capital programs to address evolving customer needs. Finance and financial products activities demonstrate stable performance through disciplined credit management, low delinquency rates and funding strategies that blend strong cash flows with selective debt issuance, maintaining redundant liquidity to support strategic investments. Across its highly diversified enterprise, Berkshire Hathaway deploys capital buffers, diversified resource allocation, risk-mitigation mechanisms and forward-looking planning to sustain functioning, absorb disturbances and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

The report describes a range of strategic and operational initiatives that collectively support the company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under adversity, including ongoing investments in capacity, systems, personnel and infrastructure to sustain business continuity and flexibility in the face of external pressures.  To address factors that could materially affect our results, we will continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions or enterprise license agreements, provide high-quality technical support, encourage third-party application development on our platforms and focus on retaining customers at renewal.  Our plans to invest for future growth include the expansion of data center capacity, the hiring of additional personnel—particularly in direct sales, customer-related areas and research and development—the expansion of domestic and international sales and marketing activities, development of next-generation service offerings (such as our analytics, community and Internet of Things clouds), integration of acquired technologies and the addition of distribution channels and global infrastructure.  We regularly evaluate acquisitions, joint ventures, services, technologies and intellectual property rights to enhance our service offerings and competitive position.  In support of operational flexibility and risk mitigation, we maintain a $650 million revolving credit facility for working capital, capital expenditures and permitted acquisitions, and believe that existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with cash provided by operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months, although additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all.  We also closely manage seasonal billing and renewal patterns—our fourth quarter has historically been strongest for new business and renewals, driving first-quarter collections and operating cash flow—while adequately staffing and scaling our multi-tenant, single-platform architecture, data centers and support functions to ensure system integrity, continuous service delivery and ongoing enhancement of functionality, security and ease of use despite evolving market volatility and resource constraints.

Our management discussion describes a multifaceted approach to sustaining performance under both nominal and extreme pressures by combining diversified go-to-market channels with an integrated marketplace strategy across direct-to-consumer and wholesale operations and by driving operational excellence through manufacturing efficiency, product design and innovation.  We seek to make our supply chain a competitive advantage by investing in new technologies that increase automation, reduce waste and expedite speed to market and customization, and we continue to expand our direct-to-consumer business while improving working capital efficiency and deploying capital effectively.  To preserve continuity in the face of operational disruptions such as west coast port congestion, we mitigated negative impacts through higher air freight usage; to address volatile foreign currency environments, we employ a centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program that leverages natural offsets, standard currency rates and hedging with forward contracts and options, as well as a foreign currency adjustment program with factories to stabilize inventory costs.  Our strong liquidity profile—comprising cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and access to committed credit facilities—combined with disciplined infrastructure investments in digital capabilities, supply chain and corporate initiatives, share repurchases funded by operating cash flow and dividend programs, underpins our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity.  As evidenced by record revenues, gross margin expansion and earnings growth despite significant foreign currency headwinds, this trajectory model of resilience enables the company to maintain integrity and performance, adapt to environmental perturbations and emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

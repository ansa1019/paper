Throughout the period, management emphasized the reliability of operating cash flow as a primary resource for sustaining business continuity and enabling investments in strategic growth initiatives, noting that “our cash generated from operations continues to be a significant source of funds for investing in our growth, including acquisitions and strategic alliances, managing our contingencies and reducing our debt levels.” Based on the current business plan, the company believes its existing cash balances, projected operating cash generation and access to capital markets and credit facilities will be sufficient to fund operations, invest in infrastructure, pay legal-related liabilities, fund possible mergers and acquisitions and service and repay existing debt, thereby underpinning operational flexibility and risk mitigation. Excess cash is deployed into short-term financial instruments to mitigate principal risk through instrument and counterparty diversification, and direct exposure to any single industry or issuer is limited. Regular assessments of economic, healthcare industry and market dynamics drive operational effectiveness and efficiency initiatives designed to align expenses with revenues while preserving capacity for research and development, capital investments and workforce programs to maintain organizational health. In response, various restructuring initiatives have been undertaken, with the 2014 restructuring plan expected to result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $255 million to $270 million and reduce gross annual expenses by approximately $200 million by the end of 2016, a substantial portion of which is to be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives. Foreign currency fluctuations are managed at the corporate level by reporting net sales on a constant currency basis to facilitate performance maintenance and comparison, and exposure to market risk from exchange rate changes is actively hedged. The company continues to adapt to government and private sector reforms intended to contain healthcare costs and pricing pressures by reinvesting amounts that would have been expended on medical device excise taxes into jobs, innovation, research and development, collaborations with universities and other initiatives to drive long-term revenue growth. Investment-grade credit ratings are maintained through a diversified product portfolio, strong cash flow, solid financial fundamentals and a disciplined financial strategy. Global expansion efforts include targeted infrastructure investments in twenty emerging markets identified for strong growth potential, enhancing competitive positioning and resource deployment. Strategic acquisitions, such as Xlumena, Celonova and the American Medical Systems male urology portfolio, are being integrated and reconstituted into existing divisions to reconfigure product offerings and capture new market opportunities. Accounting and control processes are structured to sustain system integrity and support timely decision making: sales return reserves are established based on historical trends; inventory provisions for excess, expired and obsolete stock are calculated from forecasted net sales subject to variability in product launches; intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilities are fair-valued and remeasured for changes in discount rates and revenue or regulatory milestones; goodwill balances are tested for impairment using a risk-adjusted discounted cash flow method with ongoing monitoring of projected cash flows, growth rates and weighted-average cost of capital; and internal control over financial reporting is designed and tested to provide reasonable assurance of reliable financial statements, all of which constitute resilience mechanisms enabling the company to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning and sustain performance under challenging conditions.

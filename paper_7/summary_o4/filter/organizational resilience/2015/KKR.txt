Global and regional economic conditions have a substantial impact on our financial condition and results of operations, and periods of volatility and dislocation in the capital markets present substantial risks, but also can present us with opportunities to invest at reduced valuations that position us for future growth. Market disruptions, including equity market volatility, widening credit spreads, changing interest rates and foreign exchange fluctuations, can adversely affect our ability to deploy capital, refinance debt and realise returns, while also creating opportunities to invest at more attractive prices. Our ability to grow and maintain revenues depends in part on our capacity to attract new capital and investors, to deploy capital from our funds and balance sheet effectively, and to realise investments, even in challenging market environments. We have expanded into new strategies such as energy, infrastructure, real estate, alternative credit and hedge funds, broadened our investor base and raised successor funds, reflecting operational flexibility and strategic adaptation to competitive pressures and evolving customer needs. Reduced levels of transaction activity or increased cost of credit may result in lower transaction fees and lower syndication volumes, underscoring the variability of capital deployment and the need for ongoing reconfiguration of resource allocation. We manage our liquidity and capital requirements by focusing on cash flows from operations, investment realisations, debt financing arrangements and distributions to fund investors, while maintaining access to committed credit facilities and leveraging strategic partnerships to preserve continuity under adverse conditions. Our consolidated reporting policies, including the election of the fair value option for investments and debt obligations, and our use of non-GAAP metrics such as assets under management, fee-paying assets under management, economic net income and after-tax cash earnings, reflect a systemic perspective and provide stakeholders with measures of performance under pressure and the integrity of our financial position. Our valuation and reporting methods employ significant judgments and assumptions to determine fair values in markets that vary in liquidity and transparency, reinforcing the importance of robust risk assessment, strategic foresight and adaptive decision-making in preserving organisational integrity and performance maintenance in the face of external disturbances.

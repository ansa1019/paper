Management’s discussion and analysis emphasizes our strategic and operational measures designed to absorb environmental pressures and sustain performance under challenging conditions, including active portfolio management of our businesses, disciplined capital allocation, operational effectiveness initiatives and investments in innovation and integration of technology and services to deliver differentiated client value. Our key enterprise priorities for 2016 include building high-quality revenue while meeting earnings goals, enhancing client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions, and delivering innovation and integration to support differentiated value for our clients. We have advanced our go-to-market strategies and expanded our account processing capabilities through acquisitions such as Open Solutions, reconstituting our solution offerings and allocating resources to grow recurring revenue streams and strengthen customer partnerships. Amid rapid industry evolution and heightened regulatory requirements, we anticipate continued investment in digital channels, transaction processing infrastructure and service innovation, leveraging economies of scale to manage cost structure, mitigate risks and seize revenue opportunities. Scale efficiencies, expense discipline and data center and real estate consolidation have favorably impacted our cost of processing and services, while capital expenditures and share repurchases are funded through operating cash flow generated by our recurring fee-based businesses. We actively manage liquidity and financial resources—using revolving credit facilities, term loans and senior note offerings with prudent covenants and maturities—to maintain financial flexibility, refinance maturing debt, optimize our capital structure and support acquisitions. Our credit ratings, covenant compliance and transparent off-balance sheet practices underpin access to capital and facilitate adaptability to market volatility, thereby preserving organizational coherence, operational continuity and long-term growth under varying internal and external disturbances.

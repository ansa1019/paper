Our management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition, including safety, innovation, product and service quality and organizational health, and we have embedded a performance-with-purpose approach focused on human, environmental and talent sustainability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. We anticipate that volatile macroeconomic, geopolitical, regulatory and social conditions will continue and have designed our business strategies to address and adapt by upgrading commercial capabilities, building balanced portfolios across categories and geographies, accelerating efforts to meet shifting consumer needs, and developing new ways to reach consumers through digital marketing, social media and content creation. We continue productivity and capability transformation through multi-year plans that strengthen operations by automating processes, making products for one market on another’s production lines, eliminating duplication, leveraging global scale, deploying new technologies, integrating our global supply chain and enabling engineers to monitor our production systems remotely, thereby reconfiguring resources to preserve or improve functioning under internal or external disturbances. We foster a culture of collaboration and talent sustainability, exercising discipline in capital allocation by reinvesting in our business, pursuing acquisitions aligned with strategic initiatives, and returning residual cash to shareholders, all aimed at enhancing our dynamic capabilities and organizational resilience. We leverage an integrated risk management framework—overseen by our board and its committees and executed through a cross-functional risk committee, division and country risk committees, a centralized risk management office, corporate audit and compliance and ethics departments—to identify, assess, prioritize, address, manage, monitor and communicate top strategic, financial, operating, compliance, safety, reputational and other risks across our operations, and we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging strategies to maintain system integrity and performance. During 2015, evolving exchange control regulations, reduced access to foreign currency and inability to import raw materials in Venezuela led us to conclude we no longer had control or significant influence over our Venezuelan subsidiaries and joint venture, and we deconsolidated these entities, recorded a full impairment of our investments and adjusted our operating structure to preserve value and continuity in challenging conditions.

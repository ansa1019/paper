Management’s discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements addressing risks and uncertainties, including our pursuit of additional financing and debt restructuring, assessments of liquidity, capital resources, and cash flows from operations to meet requirements over the next twelve months. We are continuously evaluating alternatives for efficiently funding capital expenditures, dilution-management activities and ongoing operations, including obtaining debt and lease financing, revolving credit facilities, and term loans. To develop new product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality, we invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities and equipment, and R&D. In order to optimize operations, improve efficiency and increase our focus on core memory operations, we entered into various restructuring activities and recorded related asset impairments, and as of September 3, 2015, we did not anticipate significant additional costs for these activities. We executed the 2016 inotera supply agreement establishing pricing based on an equal share of margin and a wind-down mechanism for capacity allocation. Our capital spending forecast for 2016 includes $5.3–5.8 billion for property, plant and equipment, including expansion of clean room space in Singapore to facilitate gradual capacity additions in response to market requirements. Board-authorized common stock repurchase programs provide flexibility to adjust dilution and allocate surplus cash. We manage contingent liabilities by accruing for probable losses, estimate lower-of-cost-or-net-realizable-value adjustments based on projected selling prices and volumes, and review property, plant and equipment for impairment where undiscounted cash flows are insufficient. Critical accounting judgments include valuations in business acquisitions and consolidations, realizability of deferred tax assets and valuation allowances, estimates of inventory recoverability, impairment analyses, and the fair value of stock-based compensation. Off-balance sheet arrangements such as capped calls reduce dilution risk under varying stock price scenarios and provide contingent receipts. Our approach to financing, investment, restructuring, supply agreements, and risk management reflects our objective to absorb strain, preserve operational integrity, and adapt to market and technological disturbances while maintaining performance and supporting strategic agility.

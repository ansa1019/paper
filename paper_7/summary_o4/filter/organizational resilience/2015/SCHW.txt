The company has established a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework, approved by the board and overseen by a global risk committee and functional sub-committees, to identify, assess, measure, monitor and mitigate operational, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, legal and model risks in support of business continuity and performance maintenance under both nominal and stressed conditions. Operational resilience is fostered through backup and recovery functions at two data centers with periodic disaster recovery testing, policies and technology to guard against system interruptions, errors, fraud and unauthorized access, and vendor management standards to protect critical processes. Information security risk is managed via advanced monitoring systems, strict access controls and employee training to deter cyber threats and safeguard client data. The company conducts regular consolidated liquidity stress testing, maintains high-quality liquid assets, and preserves diversity of funding sources—including client cash balances swept to its bank, a $750 million committed unsecured credit facility, uncommitted bank lines, Federal Reserve discount window and Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and authority to issue up to $1.5 billion of commercial paper—to ensure the ability to meet obligations under expected and extreme scenarios. Capital resilience is maintained through internal targets for tier 1 leverage ratios, ongoing capital stress testing against adverse macroeconomic and entity-specific events, a formal capital contingency plan for low-probability, high-impact events, and compliance with proposed OCC recovery planning guidelines that require banks to develop plans for remaining a going concern during financial or operational stress. Credit risk is mitigated by collateral arrangements that require the fair value of collateral to exceed loan balances, ongoing monitoring of borrower credit metrics, loan-level loss estimation models incorporating housing price indices, interest rate projections and delinquency trends, and concentration limits. The company’s compliance program, supported by policies, procedures and controls, addresses suitability, conflicts, anti-money laundering, privacy and disclosure obligations to reduce legal and reputational exposures. Model risk governance defines roles, responsibilities and risk ratings for models used in capital and liquidity management, interest and credit risk estimation, and client portfolio guidance. Off-balance-sheet arrangements—including firm commitments to extend credit, guarantees and standby letters of credit—are subject to risk limits and contingent funding plans to preserve system integrity and enable adaptive response to internal or external variations and disturbances.

Starbucks’ 2015 Management’s Discussion and Analysis describes a multifaceted approach to sustaining performance under varying pressures by making disciplined investments in its global business model, store partners and digital platforms to enable operational flexibility, resource reconfiguration and system expansion through new store openings and targeted remodels. The company actively manages liquidity and business continuity via an unsecured revolving credit facility, a commercial paper program and strategic long-term debt issuances, while deploying forward-starting interest rate swaps, commodity hedges and foreign currency derivatives to mitigate market, price and translation risks and preserve system integrity. Supply-chain improvements, sourcing initiatives and the shift between company-operated and licensed stores illustrate adaptive resource allocation and local market responsiveness, and impairments of long-lived and goodwill assets are evaluated through discounted cash-flow models that reflect evolving operating conditions. The consolidation of the Starbucks Japan joint venture—funded by offshore cash and supported by build-to-suit lease arrangements—demonstrates organizational reconstitution and reinvestment of earnings to maintain strategic agility without repatriation. Consistent dividends, share repurchases and capital contributions to equity investees are balanced against reinvestment needs, and annual risk-management policies with defined hedging limits and counterparty credit controls enable Starbucks to foresee, confront and adapt to external disturbances, preserving functioning and positioning the company to emerge stronger amid environmental turbulence.

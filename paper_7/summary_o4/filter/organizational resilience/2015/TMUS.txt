Management’s discussion and analysis emphasizes strategic initiatives and operational measures that align with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including the un-carrier proposition and ongoing network improvements designed to eliminate customer pain points and strengthen retention under competitive pressures. The company has substantially completed upgrading its network to LTE and is building out its 700 MHz A-block spectrum licenses while continuing to opportunistically acquire additional spectrum through private‐party transactions and FCC auctions, reflecting deliberate resource allocation, future orientation, and the capacity to absorb external variations. The introduction of Jump! On Demand, which capitalizes and depreciates leased wireless devices over the lease term rather than recognizing cost upon delivery, exemplifies service innovation and operational flexibility in response to shifting customer needs. Cost of services decreased in part due to synergies realized from the decommissioning of the MetroPCS CDMA network and lower lease expenses, demonstrating resource reconfiguration and risk mitigation, while improvements in branded postpaid churn driven by enhanced network quality and customer service underscore organizational health and adaptability. Adjusted EBITDA grew on the back of increased service revenues and focused cost control, and free cash flow rose as net cash provided by operating activities outpaced capital expenditures, evidencing performance maintenance under financial constraints. To bolster business continuity and crisis preparedness, the company has enhanced liquidity through the sale of equipment installment plan receivables on a revolving basis, utilization of an unsecured revolving credit facility, and issuance of senior secured term loans and notes, all while maintaining compliance with restrictive covenants. Planning for $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion in cash capital expenditures for property, equipment and spectrum in 2016, together with the capacity to raise an additional $6.0 billion in debt without adversely impacting credit ratings, illustrates strategic foresight, risk assessment, and resource generation intended to preserve or improve functioning amid environmental disturbances.

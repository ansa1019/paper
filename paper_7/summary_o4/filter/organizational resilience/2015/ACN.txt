The disclosures clarify that net income attributable to noncontrolling interests eliminates earnings or expenses linked to equity interests held by certain current and former members of Accenture leadership and their permitted transferees in Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries, and that since January 2002 these noncontrolling interests also include immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in the Avanade Inc. subsidiary; the resulting net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to its shareholders, with further details on the business-organizational structure provided elsewhere. While the primary focus is financial, this delineation of equity interests and income allocation reflects the companyâ€™s organizational structure and resource distribution mechanisms that underpin governance and operational clarity.

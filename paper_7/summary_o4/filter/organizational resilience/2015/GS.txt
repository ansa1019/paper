Managementâ€™s discussion and analysis highlights our maintenance of business continuity plans, information security programs, and comprehensive risk management and liquidity policies designed to ensure continuity of operations and positive adjustment under challenging conditions.  We emphasize our ability to manage the size and composition of the balance sheet through quarterly planning, business-specific limits, monitoring of key metrics and scenario analyses, and by maintaining global core liquid assets sized to cover 30-day stressed cash and collateral outflows.  Our contingency funding plan provides a framework to identify drivers of capital and liquidity stress, assigns responsibilities for escalation of potential crises, and prescribes mitigating actions.  Treasury and liquidity risk management conduct intraday and longer-term stress tests, complemented by firmwide and divisional stress scenarios, to assess funding adequacy and inform our capital planning and stress-testing processes required under CCAR and DFAST.  In addition, we maintain formal resolution and recovery plans that describe strategies for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure and steps to conserve capital and maintain liquidity through prolonged stress.  These governance frameworks are supported by independent control and support functions, regular training and development programs, and performance evaluations that reinforce a strong culture of risk awareness, operational flexibility and reputational excellence.

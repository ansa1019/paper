We have a corporate compliance program designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems and through the promotion of a culture of compliance. We closely monitor the results of our discovery, research, clinical trials and nonclinical studies and frequently evaluate our drug development programs in light of new data and scientific, business and commercial insights, with the objective of balancing risk and potential; this process can result in abrupt changes in focus and priorities as new information becomes available and as we gain additional understanding of our ongoing programs and potential new programs, as well as those of our competitors. We believe that pursuing research in diverse areas allows us to balance the risks inherent in drug development and may provide drug candidates that will form our pipeline in future years, and we plan to continue investing in our research programs and fostering scientific innovation in order to identify and develop transformative medicines. We dedicate substantial management and other resources in order to obtain and maintain appropriate levels of reimbursement for our products, and we adjust our estimated rebates, chargebacks and discounts based on new information, including information regarding actual rebates, chargebacks and discounts for our products, as it becomes available. We track actual returns by individual production lots and continuously monitor inventory levels in the distribution channel, and if necessary we adjust our estimated product returns and perform an assessment of the recoverability of capitalized inventory during each reporting period, writing down any excess and obsolete inventories to their net realizable value in the period in which the impairment is first identified. We test our intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1 and more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstance suggest that impairment may exist, comparing fair value with carrying value and recording charges where appropriate. We intend to rely on our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash flows from product sales as our primary source of liquidity, and we will continue to manage our capital structure and consider all financing opportunities that could strengthen our long-term liquidity profile, although negative covenants in our credit agreement may prohibit or limit our ability to access these sources of liquidity. We base our research and development accruals on our knowledge of the research and development programs, services performed for the period, experience with related activities and the expected duration of third-party service contracts, and we review our estimates and assumptions on at least a quarterly basis, making modifications to reflect changed circumstances as necessary. We have recorded restructuring expenses related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters and headcount reductions, maintain ongoing lease obligations through maturity and pursue sublease arrangements and other modifications to mitigate facility costs, reflecting our commitment to preserve or improve functioning despite internal or external pressures.

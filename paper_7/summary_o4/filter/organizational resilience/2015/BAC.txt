The MD&A describes a comprehensive risk and capital management framework designed to support organizational resilience through a formally articulated risk appetite, multi‐level governance and ongoing oversight by the board, its committees and management risk committees, all supported by three lines of defense. A strong risk culture, reinforced by the corporation’s code of conduct, encourages sound decision‐making and disciplined risk‐taking within set limits. Proactive measures include periodic stress testing under adverse scenarios to assess impacts on capital, liquidity and earnings; liquidity coverage ratios and contingency funding plans to ensure operational continuity; forward‐looking capital planning and internal capital adequacy assessments incorporating earnings and balance‐sheet forecasts; and enterprise‐wide monitoring through risk and control self‐assessments, value‐at‐risk models and scenario analyses. Asset‐and‐liability management and hedging programs manage interest rate, foreign exchange and market exposures, while credit risk is mitigated through underwriting standards, portfolio diversification, loan workout programs, repurchase settlements, representations and warranties provisions and credit derivatives. Operational resilience is further supported by global compliance, internal audit, business recovery planning and infrastructure investments. Collectively, these integrated risk management, contingency planning and governance processes, backed by culture and resources, enable the corporation to absorb strain, adapt to changing conditions and maintain performance despite internal or external disturbances.

Lockheed Martin acknowledges operation in an environment characterized by increasing complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures and accordingly has focused its strategy on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of products and services and placing security capability quickly into customers’ hands at affordable prices. Recognizing that customers are resource constrained, the Company has endeavored to develop and extend its portfolio in adjacent markets close to core capabilities, grow international sales and maintain affordability initiatives, while investing in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements and in its people to ensure technical skills are available to succeed. The Company continuously shapes its portfolio through independent research and development, selective acquisitions at attractive valuations to expand or complement current offerings, exploratory divestitures of non-strategic businesses and internal realignments to enhance systemic performance and sustain competitive advantage. In late 2015, Lockheed Martin realigned programs among business segments to better integrate capabilities in command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, cyber, energy solutions and ground stations, and combined its government IT and technical services segment with an external partner to unlock value, with such realignments not affecting consolidated operating results. In its missiles and fire control and information technology businesses, the Company has responded to market pressures from the fragmentation of large contracts into smaller awards primarily on price by emphasizing cost structures, risk retirements and affordability. The Company’s contract accounting and project management processes employ the percentage-of-completion method with continuous identification and monitoring of technical, schedule and cost risks, adjustments to profit-booking rates as risks are retired or identified and provisions for contract losses when estimated costs exceed expected sales. Its liquidity and capital deployment practices include balanced use of operating cash flow for capital expenditures, research and development, pension funding and portfolio investments, returning free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and maintaining diversified financing sources—credit facilities, commercial paper, bonds and letters of credit—to manage funding timing, ensure operational continuity and preserve flexibility. The Company also periodically amends postretirement benefit plans to freeze future benefit accruals and mitigate funding volatility, and conducts quarterly reviews of environmental remediation obligations to record liabilities and associated recoverable costs, thereby preserving organizational resilience by maintaining system integrity, resources and operational flexibility under varying internal and external disturbances.

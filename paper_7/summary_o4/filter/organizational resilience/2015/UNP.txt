During 2015, we continued our focus on safety to reduce risk and eliminate incidents for our employees, our customers and the public, achieving our best ever reportable personal injury incidents per 200,000 employee-hours of 0.87 and a 3% improvement in our crossing incident rate per million train miles compared to the prior year, demonstrating our employees’ dedication to our safety initiatives and our efforts to further engage the workforce through programs such as Courage to Care, Total Safety Culture, and UP Way (our continuous improvement culture); significant improvements were made in our operating and service metrics, as average train speed increased 6% and average terminal dwell time decreased 3%, both reflecting the impact of lower volumes, improved network fluidity and a strong resource position, and in 2016 we will continue to align resources with customer demand, continue to improve network performance, and maintain our “surge capability.” With the dramatic drop in fuel prices during 2015, we recognize that fuel price projections remain uncertain and that volatile fuel prices will have timing impacts on earnings as our fuel surcharge programs trail fluctuations by approximately two months, and we could see positive or negative effects on various commodities and overall consumer spending. Despite a 6% decrease in carloads, our second-best financial performance ever was supported by core pricing gains of 3.7%, productivity initiatives, improved network operations, free cash flow of $524 million, and record-low operating ratio of 63.1%, illustrating our ability to absorb strain and preserve performance under challenging conditions. Our 2016 capital plan of approximately $3.75 billion, including expenditures for Positive Train Control, 230 locomotives and 450 freight cars, may be revised if business conditions warrant or new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns; we expect to invest 55% to 60% of our capital in renewing and improving existing assets, balancing terminal and mainline capacity, making technology improvements, and commercial facility projects to meet customer demand and support long-term growth. As of December 31, 2015, our principal sources of liquidity included cash, cash equivalents, our receivables securitization facility, a $1.7 billion revolving credit facility with no borrowings outstanding, and access to commercial paper and other capital markets financings, all of which are dependent on market conditions and our bond ratings; we monitor our debt-to-capital and debt-to-net-worth coverage ratios, adjusted for off-balance-sheet lease obligations, to balance cost-effective and efficient access to capital with our overall cost of capital. We employ derivative financial instruments, including swaps, collars, futures and forward contracts, to mitigate our exposure to adverse movements in interest rates and fuel prices, without taking leveraged or speculative positions. We continue to assess environmental risks and obligations at 290 sites, accounting for probable remediation costs and ongoing monitoring, and to manage personal injury and asbestos liabilities through actuarial analyses of asserted and unasserted claims. We negotiate labor agreements under the Railway Labor Act with 14 major rail unions representing 85% of our workforce and have historically avoided work stoppages, reflecting our ability to adapt to labor-related pressures. Through regular depreciation studies for our more than 60 asset classes and measuring rail lives in millions of gross tons per mile, we maintain and renew our capital-intensive network infrastructure to ensure operational continuity, resilience to internal and external disturbances, and the partial maintenance of system integrity and performance. We believe these combined operational, financial, strategic and risk-management initiatives demonstrate our ability to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning despite adversity, and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations.

Management continually reviews its research and development pipeline, identifying anticipated activities and prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of successful development, market potential and availability of human and capital resources, and reallocates resources among its R&D portfolio to best support future growth. It expects R&D expenses to increase over 2015 levels to support expansion of clinical studies in liver disease, HIV and inflammation, and anticipates higher selling, general and administrative expenses to build out and expand global commercial infrastructure. The Company believes that existing capital resources, supplemented by operating cash flows, will be adequate to satisfy foreseeable capital needs but acknowledges the potential need for additional equity or debt financings. Under its five-year revolving credit facility, management retains the right to prepay borrowings without penalty and must comply with customary covenants, and the Board has authorized multi-billion-dollar share repurchase programs and initiated a quarterly dividend as strategic tools to deploy capital. The MD&A identifies exposure to uncertainties and external pressures including an uncertain macroeconomic environment, pricing measures to reduce healthcare spending, foreign currency volatility, inaccuracies in patient start estimates, competitive launches, shifts in payer mix, regulatory timing and outcomes, and potential litigation or tax audits, and describes management’s ongoing processes for estimating allowances for government and other rebates and chargebacks, monitoring allowances for doubtful accounts, evaluating deferred tax assets, and assessing contractual commitments for clinical trials, capital projects and operating leases to maintain operational flexibility, preserve financial integrity and support the Company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under challenging conditions.

Management’s discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, acknowledging that actual results may differ significantly due to the risk factors described elsewhere, and reflects the company’s commitment to absorb strain and preserve performance despite internal or external pressures. The company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements over the next 12 months, and anticipates funding future dividends, share repurchases and debt repayments from domestic cash, operating activities and borrowings. The company’s investment policy requires marketable securities to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing principal loss and it has, and may continue to enter into, interest rate swaps and currency swaps to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk on its notes. The business is managed by geographic segment—to align with unique market dynamics and distribution partners in each region—and the company regularly reviews inventory, manufacturing-related assets and component prepayments for impairment, recording write-downs and cancellation fee accruals when demand forecasts, product life-cycle status or supplier conditions indicate recoverability may be impaired. Warranty costs are accrued at the time of revenue recognition based on historical and projected claim rates and cost-per-claim and adjusted as necessary, and tax and legal liabilities are recorded when probable and reasonably estimable, reflecting a system to mitigate financial risk. The company continues to invest in research and development—driving headcount growth and material expenditures—and anticipates approximately $15.0 billion of capital expenditures in 2016 for product tooling, manufacturing process equipment, data centres, corporate facilities, information systems enhancements and retail store facilities to support ongoing operations and future growth. To support its capital return programme, the board increased share repurchase authorisation to $140 billion, raised dividends and expects to execute repurchases, dividend payments and tax remittances through March 2017 while accessing domestic and international debt markets as needed. Revenue is allocated and deferred for unspecified software upgrade rights, non-software services and customer incentive programmes using best estimates of selling price, aligning recognition with performance obligations and absorbing potential variability. Off-balance-sheet arrangements include $29.5 billion of third-party manufacturing and component purchase commitments and future minimum lease payments of $6.3 billion under non-cancelable operating leases, supporting continuity of supply, facility operations and retail presence under varying conditions. In response to competitive pressures, the company expects to continue product pricing actions and to manage product quality, warranty costs and demand stimulation, recognizing that fluctuations in exchange rates, commodity costs, compressed product life cycles and industry-wide pricing pressures could affect gross margins. Through these financial, operational and structural measures, the company maintains the ability to absorb strain, adapt resource deployment and preserve functionality and performance under challenging and varied conditions.

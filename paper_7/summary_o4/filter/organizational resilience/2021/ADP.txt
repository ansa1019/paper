In response to the significant impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the business environment and client operations, ADP maintained critical human capital management services—including the processing of payroll and tax obligations—to preserve functioning under challenging conditions while prioritizing the safety of its associates and the needs of its clients. The company focused on providing information and tools to help clients understand and navigate governmental relief measures and released a return-to-workplace solution that assists clients in bringing employees back to work safely through a comprehensive set of tools designed to streamline the process. With a highly cash-generative, low capital intensity business model, ADP generated sufficient free cash flow to satisfy dividends and modest debt obligations, enabling it to absorb the impact of downturns and remain steadfast in its reinvestments, longer-term strategy and shareholder-friendly actions. The firm’s client funds investment strategy—structured to allow it to average through interest rate cycles by laddering maturities out to five years for the extended portfolio and ten years for the long portfolio, supported by a $9.7 billion commercial paper program, committed credit facilities and short-term reverse repurchase agreements—emphasizes safety of principal, liquidity and diversification, thereby preserving system integrity and performance under market disruptions. In its PEO segment, ADP utilizes historical loss experience, actuarial judgment and reinsurance arrangements that cap exposure per occurrence to mitigate workers’ compensation and employer’s liability risks, maintaining organizational health under potential hazards. ADP’s disciplined liquidity management, including varied credit facility maturities, proactive investments in research and development, and broad-based transformation initiatives, underpins operational flexibility and forward-looking resilience to environmental turbulence, interest rate variability and other uncertainties.

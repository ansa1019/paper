The company acknowledges that “our manufacturing lead times are very long and in some cases, extend to be twelve months or longer, which requires us to make estimates of customers’ future demand,” and that “these conditions could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or excess inventory,” particularly as it remains “supply-constrained into the first half of fiscal year 2023, primarily in gaming and networking.” To mitigate these pressures, it “has placed non-cancellable inventory orders for certain supply in advance of our historical lead times, paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity” and has “made substantial strides in broadening our supply base to scale our company and better serve customer demand.” The company also recognizes that “it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining … on demand for our products” and that “as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the timing and overall demand from customers, the availability of supply chain, logistical services and component supply, and the impact of rising inflation may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial results.” Financially, it maintains that “our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations” and continuously evaluates liquidity and capital resources to ensure it can finance future obligations. In response to regulatory adversity, the company notes that “the parties agreed to terminate [the Arm acquisition] because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction” and “intends to record in operating expenses a $1.36 billion charge … reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing in September 2020.” It is also “monitoring potential regulation changes in California, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and other jurisdictions” with respect to climate and sustainability, and “plans to build Earth-2, an AI supercomputer dedicated to predicting the impacts of climate change and increase our purchases of renewable energy credits.”

The discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve operations under unprecedented external pressures, noting that “the spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including restricting employee travel, modifying employee work locations and cancelling physical participation in meetings, events and conferences)” and that “while we are confident that our strategy and long-term contingency planning have positioned us well to weather the current uncertainty, we cannot at this time fully quantify or forecast the impact of COVID-19 on our business,” thereby reflecting positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Throughout the narrative the company emphasizes continuity and resource flexibility, stating that it “manages worldwide cash requirements by, among other things, reviewing available funds held by our foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness by which those funds can be accessed in the United States,” that it “maintains these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor[s] the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversif[ies] our investments in order to minimize our credit risk,” and that it believes “existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available short- and long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and dividend payments (if any) in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months.” The company further describes proactive risk mitigation and operational reconfiguration, noting that it “monitors global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis and continue[s] to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency, as well as a better alignment of expenses with revenues,” which led to restructuring actions such as the consolidation of acquired wafer and test facility operations, the sale and cessation of certain manufacturing facilities, and “organizational initiatives to better align its global workforce with its long-term strategic plan,” each of which entails reconfiguring resources and capabilities to preserve and improve functioning despite adversity. Finally, the company outlines its financial resilience through detailed liquidity and capital resource management, including periodic use of its $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, sensitivity analyses of interest rate and foreign currency exposures (e.g., a 100 basis point shift in interest rates or a 10 percent adverse currency movement), and ongoing compliance with leverage covenants, all of which serve as mechanisms to maintain integrity and performance under both nominal and extreme variations in market conditions.

We believe that our product and geographic diversification differentiate us from the vast majority of our competitors and has been a source of stability during periods of industry volatility, and that our long-term business strategy—focused on sustained growth in book value through a combination of underwriting and investment income—enables the company to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite unexpected situations. Our profit-center structure, which grants each senior management team the necessary autonomy within underwriting authorities to make operating decisions and create products and coverages needed by its target customer base, fosters organizational flexibility, localized decision-making, and rapid adaptation to emerging customer needs. We maintain highly liquid investments, credit facilities, and reinsurance protection—supplemented by cash pooling programs and duration-matched portfolios for life and variable annuity liabilities—to ensure operational continuity and sufficient liquidity to meet unforeseen large claim demands or catastrophic events. We have implemented a comprehensive risk management framework that aggregates exposures across wind, flood, earthquake, wildfire, cyber, political risk, crop insurance, and pandemic scenarios, sets limits based on modeled probable maximum loss, and deploys catastrophe and quota-share reinsurance layers to mitigate extreme losses while preserving system integrity and capital resources. Our investment portfolio is externally managed under strict diversification and credit-limit protocols to maximize total return within prescribed risk parameters, and we conduct regular stress testing—including climate-change-adjusted scenarios—to assess potential impacts and support strategic foresight. We maintain access to capital markets via shelf registrations and a multi-currency letter-of-credit facility, and we manage our overall capital structure—including share repurchases, dividends, and trust preferred securities—to balance resource generation with solvency requirements, preserve organizational health, and sustain our competitive advantage under challenging conditions.

Throughout fiscal 2021 and in response to evolving market conditions including the COVID-19 pandemic, Nike accelerated its “consumer direct acceleration” strategy to enhance organizational resilience by “doubling the impact of innovation, increasing our speed and agility to market and growing our direct connections with consumers,” aligning product creation and operating structures around key consumer segments, and unifying investments in data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering and inventory management on an end-to-end technology foundation to accelerate digital transformation, unlock efficiency and drive speed and responsiveness globally. The company implemented leadership and operating-model changes to streamline and speed execution, reallocated resources through a net workforce reduction and committed future wage-related savings to execute strategic growth initiatives, while maintaining strong liquidity of $13.5 billion in cash, equivalents and short-term investments. Despite temporary store closures, supply-chain disruptions from container shortages and port congestion, Nike achieved record revenues, reduced inventories by 7 percent and leveraged its Nike Direct business by “leveraging our digital platforms with our store footprint to connect directly with the consumer,” demonstrating operational flexibility, business continuity and preservation of performance under adversity. Concurrently, management reconfigured select Latin American markets from wholesale and direct-to-consumer to distributor operating models to reduce selling and administrative expenses and mitigate foreign-exchange volatility, and maintained a centralized foreign-currency risk-management program—using natural offsets, currency correlations and derivative contracts within the Nike Trading Company and factory currency adjustment programs—to partially offset transactional and translational exposures, underscoring a systemic perspective on risk mitigation. Finally, the company reinforced resilience through disciplined capital planning and resource deployment, maintaining committed credit facilities and a commercial paper program, generating robust operating cash flow driven by working-capital improvements, investing approximately 3 percent of revenues in long-lived digital, facilities and supply-chain infrastructure, and preserving flexibility for share repurchases in accordance with capital needs and market conditions.

During the year the company continued to absorb the operational strain imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and global supply chain disruptions by adjusting network capacity and resource deployment, experiencing a year-over-year increase in commercial volume as business returned to pre-pandemic levels despite declines in business-to-consumer volume, while COVID-19-related flight reductions in Asia contributed to a fall in international volume. Management reported that global supply chain disruption and capacity constraints drove higher transportation costs, rising inflation and labor market challenges caused wage pressures, and currency fluctuations continued to affect performance, but that the company continues to monitor these external conditions and anticipates that demand for its services will remain strong. To preserve operational continuity and performance under these challenging conditions, the company remeasured its defined benefit pension plans under the American Rescue Plan Act, realized a $3.3 billion mark-to-market gain, completed strategic divestitures and an acquisition to reconfigure its business portfolio, updated its activity-based costing and fuel surcharge programs, and deployed disciplined capital allocation and liquidity management—including a supply chain finance program for suppliers, non-GAAP performance metrics and regular evaluation of its capital structure and working capital efficiency—to maintain flexibility, mitigate risk and support its customer first, people led, innovation driven strategy within a better not bigger framework.

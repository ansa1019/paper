In response to internal and external pressures, including the COVID-19 pandemic, we launched our Success from Anywhere initiative and leveraged flex team agreements and Slack as a digital headquarters to enable operational continuity and collaboration regardless of location, provided temporary financial flexibility to customers and adjusted billing frequencies to mitigate cash flow disruptions, and implemented asset impairments and position reassignments in select real estate leases. We continue to invest for future growth by reinvesting a significant portion of operating income in research and development, marketing and sales, and professional services, expanding data center capacity and headcount—research and development headcount increased 28 percent year-over-year and data center, customer support and professional services headcount grew 43 percent—to absorb demand and scale securely. Strategic acquisitions and integration efforts, including Slack, Vlocity, MuleSoft and Acumen Solutions, support our digital transformation and broaden our service offerings while unearned revenue and remaining performance obligations are monitored and managed to align resource deployment with renewal cycles under varying currency, seasonal and geopolitical conditions. We maintain flexibility through our $3.0 billion revolving credit facility, robust cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and dynamic operating plans, positioning the organization to preserve or improve its functioning and maintain integrity and performance under both nominal and extreme conditions.

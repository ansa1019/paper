The Company continued to confront operational disruptions and maintain positive adjustment by navigating government-mandated temporary store closures, capacity limitations and shopping restrictions, which in aggregate represented approximately 4% of store days closed in fiscal 2022 compared to 24% in fiscal 2021, and by benchmarking performance against both the prior year and a comparable pre-pandemic period to assess continuity and performance under adversity. Management prioritized the health and safety of associates and customers, monitored evolving government requirements, and exercised operational flexibility through negotiated rent deferrals, timing of merchandise payments and leveraging occupancy costs to preserve functioning during exceptional conditions. To mitigate supply chain constraints and support rapid adaptation, the Company increased inventory levels by 31%, invested in expanded distribution capacity and information systems, and incurred higher wage costs, while employing foreign currency hedging instruments to offset translational and transactional exchange rate exposures and sustain merchandise margins. Liquidity and resource deployment were managed through internally generated cash flows, $6.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $1.5 billion of available credit facilities and proactive debt redemptions that yielded annualized interest savings, thereby preserving financial resilience. The reinstatement of share repurchase programs and quarterly dividend payments, together with the introduction of homegoods.com online shopping, further reflect strategic initiatives designed to absorb strain, reconfigure operational trajectories and maintain performance in the face of internal and external variations.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we adapted our theme-park operations by reopening facilities under capacity restrictions, implementing proof-of-vaccination requirements, resuming paused development projects and managing temporary closures, thereby absorbing strain and preserving operational continuity under extreme conditions. We redirected spending toward scalable infrastructure and line extensions in our cable communications segment, while reducing customer-premise equipment and support capital, to maintain network performance and allocate resources flexibly. We secured liquidity through robust operating cash flows, available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, and maintained compliance with leverage covenants, reflecting financial resilience and risk mitigation. We resumed our share repurchase program, increased dividends and reduced debt through strategic refinancing—including an exchange of senior notes that lowered our weighted-average interest rate and extended maturities—demonstrating adaptive resource reconfiguration and strategic foresight. We reorganized our segment reporting structure to enhance internal knowledge, business continuity and systemic perspective, and employ non-GAAP measures such as adjusted EBITDA and constant-currency metrics to monitor performance under pressure. In our media and studios segments, we invested substantially in content licensing, marketing and the launch of Peacock, reconfigured theatrical and digital distribution strategies in light of shifting consumer behaviors, and revised production and licensing timelines to manage disruptions in sports schedules and film releases. We implemented cost-saving initiatives, including severance and overhead reductions, reinvested savings in digital transformation projects such as Sky Glass and XClass TV, and conducted qualitative and quantitative impairment assessments of goodwill, franchise rights and content assets to safeguard system integrity against market perturbations. These practices reflect our organizational flexibility, strategic agility and multifaceted resilience in anticipating, confronting and responding to external pressures to sustain performance and emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

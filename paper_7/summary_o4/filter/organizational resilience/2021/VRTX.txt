Management’s discussion of operations highlights the Company’s capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions through strategic resource allocation, operational flexibility, risk mitigation and systematic adaptation. We invest in internal research and development and broaden our pipeline via business development transactions—such as the acquisitions of Semma and Exonics, collaborative and licensing arrangements with CRISPR, Obsidian, Arbor and Mammoth—and in-license and out-license programs to access external innovation and balance the risks inherent in product development. We build and maintain global supply chain and quality assurance resources, rely on an integrated network of third-party partners and internal capabilities to manufacture and distribute products, and adapt our supply chains for new formulations and increased production scale as needed to ensure operational continuity. We closely monitor discovery, nonclinical and clinical activities, frequently reevaluate programs in light of new data and commercial insights, and adjust focus and priorities rapidly to balance risk and potential. To sustain business continuity and patient access, we dedicate substantial management and other resources to secure and expand reimbursement arrangements with payors in U.S. and ex-U.S. markets, and we have adjusted business operations site by site in response to local COVID-19 trends and guidance while maintaining uninterrupted supply of approved medicines globally. Liquidity and capital resources—including $7.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $7.4 billion of working capital and a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility expandable to $3.5 billion—provide financial resilience to fund operating costs, research and development, acquisitions, milestone payments and share repurchases for at least the next twelve months. Our accounting for research and development expenses, deferred revenue related to government-limited reimbursement contracts, fair-value measurement of contingent consideration and in-process research and development assets, and ongoing assessments of tax provisions and valuation allowances reflect continuous evaluation of uncertainties and support the maintenance of system integrity, performance and positive adjustment under internal and external disturbances.

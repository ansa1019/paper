UnitedHealth Group reports that it continually forecasts and manages its cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet short-term and long-term obligations while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility; its regulated subsidiaries and nonregulated businesses generate significant operating cash flows, and these cash flows, together with dividends, long-term debt issuances, commercial paper and committed credit facilities, further strengthen operating and financial flexibility. The company uses these resources to expand through acquisitions, reinvest via capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. It frequently evaluates and adjusts its pricing approach in local markets, considering product positioning, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors to balance growth and profitability, and maintains a prudent, market-sustainable posture for new business and existing relationships, advocating for actuarially sound rates and partnering with states committed to program viability. In response to delivery system and payment modernization trends, the company collaborates with care providers to close care gaps, improve quality and population health, and reduce costs, leveraging data and analytics and investing in new clinical and administrative information and management systems to coordinate care around primary care physicians and drive growth in its Optum platform. Facing Medicare Advantage funding pressures, the company emphasizes effective medical and operating cost management, adjusts the size and composition of care provider networks, modifies member benefits and premiums on a county-by-county basis, and benefits from CMS quality bonuses tied to star ratings. Throughout the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, the ultimate impact on business and operations remains uncertain; the company balances COVID-19 related care costs with temporary deferrals, expands benefit coverage for telemedicine, pharmacy and testing, assists stakeholders in addressing the crisis, and acknowledges disruptions have affected risk adjustment information and revenue forecasting. Operating performance reflects revenue growth driven by people served and pricing, partially offset by COVID-19 impacts, while earnings from operations grew due to cost management initiatives, productivity gains and increased investment income across Optum Health, Optum Insight and Optum Rx. The companyâ€™s capital resource planning, including its revolving bank credit facilities and ability to issue commercial paper or long-term debt, reduces the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions and supports its confidence that capital resources are sufficient to meet its liquidity needs under varied internal and external pressures.

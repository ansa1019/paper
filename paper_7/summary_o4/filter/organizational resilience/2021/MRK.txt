In response to the unprecedented external pressures of the COVID-19 pandemic, Merck sustained operational continuity by safeguarding employee safety, ensuring delivery of medicines and vaccines, expanding manufacturing capacity through multiple government-funded and industry collaborations, and entering advance purchase and supply agreements for its investigational antiviral in more than 30 markets, even as social distancing measures, fewer patient visits and supply-chain disruptions exerted an estimated $1.3 billion negative impact on its pharmaceutical segment sales in 2021. The company reconfigured its research trajectory by discontinuing select COVID-19 development programs, recording impairment charges and reallocating resources toward higher-probability pipeline assets, while pursuing strategic acquisitions (including Acceleron and Pandion) and collaborations (with Gilead and Ridgeback) to strengthen its innovation platform and future orientation. Merck’s robust liquidity profile—characterized by $6.4 billion in working capital, a 0.4:1 operating cash-to-debt ratio, an undrawn $6 billion credit facility, and disciplined financing evidenced by $8 billion of senior notes (including proceeds allocated to sustainable projects), a $1 billion sustainability bond and ongoing dividend and share repurchase programs—underpins its financial resilience. The company’s systemic risk-management framework, encompassing comprehensive foreign-exchange and interest-rate hedging programs, high-quality investment guidelines, a structured global restructuring initiative targeting $900 million in annual cost savings by 2023, and a patent-settlement license with Pfizer, preserves its operational flexibility and competitive advantage while continually refining actuarial and tax assumptions, environmental and legal contingencies, and R&D investment to maintain performance and integrity under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

In 2021, despite ongoing impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and associated global supply chain disruptions, AMD preserved and improved its functioning by implementing employee safety measures, supporting remote work, monitoring public health directives and adjusting logistics to maintain business continuity; the company mitigated supply chain hazards through strategic long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements, including amendments to its wafer supply agreement to secure minimum annual capacity allocations through 2025 while retaining full flexibility to engage alternative foundries; supported by strong financial performance and growing cash flow generation, AMD further fortified its resilience by deliberate working-capital management—evidenced by targeted inventory builds to support customer demand, timing of supplier payments and accruals for marketing and employee incentives—by approving a $4 billion stock repurchase program to optimize capital deployment and by entering into a definitive agreement to acquire Xilinx, Inc. to strengthen its high-performance computing leadership; the company maintains confidence that its cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, revolving credit facility and access to capital markets will sufficiently fund operations, capital expenditures and strategic initiatives over the next twelve months and beyond.

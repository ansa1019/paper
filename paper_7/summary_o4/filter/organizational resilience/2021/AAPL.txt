The company reports that the COVID-19 pandemic “has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets,” with many retail stores and partner points of sale “temporarily closed at various times” and a significant number of employees working remotely; in response, the company “has reopened all of its retail stores and substantially all of its other facilities, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health” and continues “to work on safely reopening the remainder of its facilities, subject to local rules and regulations.” During the fourth quarter of 2021, “certain of the company’s component suppliers and logistical service providers experienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that affected sales worldwide,” and the company acknowledges that “similar disruptions could occur in the future.” The report cautions that “the extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company’s operational and financial performance is uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the company’s control,” including the trajectory of the pandemic, emergence of variants, effectiveness of vaccines, and public safety measures. To support business continuity and operational flexibility, the company emphasizes that it “believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $172.6 billion as of September 25, 2021, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.” The company describes its reliance on “several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing,” using demand information covering up to 150 days to mitigate supply chain risk, and discloses manufacturing purchase obligations of $54.8 billion, primarily noncancelable and with $54.7 billion payable within 12 months. The company further affirms that “focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the company’s core business strategy,” thereby reinforcing its capacity to adapt and innovate under challenging conditions. Finally, the company notes that “resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results,” and that “uncertain tax positions” and contingencies require ongoing judgment and may affect its financial resilience.

Following our April 1, 2020 merger with Sprint, we initiated comprehensive restructuring and integration activities—including network decommissioning, rationalization of retail stores and distribution channels, severance for redundant functions, and consolidation of back-office operations—to eliminate duplicative processes, realize cost efficiencies and enhance operational flexibility across our combined nationwide 5G network. The merger enhanced our spectrum portfolio, expanded our customer base, altered our product mix and accelerated service innovation, enabling us to absorb integration strain while maintaining or improving performance under dynamic market and regulatory pressures. In response to the August 2021 criminal cyberattack, we immediately launched a forensic investigation, engaged leading cybersecurity experts, coordinated with law enforcement, closed unauthorized system access, identified and notified affected customers, reset compromised credentials, provided free identity protection and scam-blocking services, and established a Cyber Transformation Office reporting directly to the CEO, demonstrating a systemic, resource-focused approach to mitigate risk, recover compromised integrity and reinforce our cybersecurity posture. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, designated by government authorities as a critical communications infrastructure provider, we implemented employee testing policies, social distancing and enhanced cleaning protocols, monitored evolving public health guidance and adjusted actions as needed to continue providing vital connectivity and support to our employees and communities. We maintain diversified liquidity sources—including cash flows from operations, securitizations of receivables, vendor financing arrangements, a revolving credit facility and debt issuances—to fund ongoing capital expenditures, spectrum acquisitions and merger-related obligations, thereby preserving our ability to meet financial commitments and sustain business continuity under adverse conditions. We continuously assess external pressures, record accruals when losses become probable and reasonably estimable, and remain committed to investing substantial resources in cybersecurity, operational resilience and strategic initiatives to uphold the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions and the integrity of our performance.

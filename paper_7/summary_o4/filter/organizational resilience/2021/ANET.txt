Our future success depends on our ability to evolve and adapt to our rapidly changing environment by developing market-leading products and features that address shifting customer needs, expanding our sales, marketing and technical partnerships, and leveraging our extensible EOS-based software to deliver high performance, scalability, availability, programmability, automation and visibility—capabilities that reflect dynamic operational flexibility and resource reconfiguration. We have experienced unpredictability in the timing and concentration of large end-customer orders, which has driven variability in revenues and required active working-capital management through increased inventory provisioning, extended-lead-time component purchase commitments and deferred revenue growth to sustain product supply and service continuity. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we prioritized employee safety, closed offices, limited travel and worked closely with contract manufacturers and supply-chain partners facing sourcing delays and governmental restrictions, funding additional working capital and incremental purchase commitments to mitigate component shortages and maintain manufacturing and distribution operations under exceptional conditions. Our robust liquidity position—$3.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held for general business purposes and long-term growth—combined with disciplined capital allocation for research and development, sales and marketing expansion and potential strategic investments, underpins our resilience strategy by enabling us to absorb strain, manage risks and preserve or improve our functioning despite adversity, while our rapid feature development and collaboration with third-party vendors exemplify our capacity for organizational agility, innovation and transformation in the face of disruptive change.

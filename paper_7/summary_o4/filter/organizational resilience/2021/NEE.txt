NEXTERA ENERGY and its subsidiaries have implemented a comprehensive set of financial, operational and strategic measures designed to absorb strain and preserve performance amid internal and external disturbances. During 2021 and 2020, FPL’s service area was impacted by hurricanes and tropical storms, which resulted in incremental storm restoration costs that FPL elected to record rather than surcharging customers, using available reserve amortization under its regulatory rate agreements to offset those costs and maintain targeted regulatory returns. NEE maintains a diversified funding strategy—drawing on operating cash flows, short- and long-term borrowings, equity issuances, differential membership interests and asset sales—to support capital expenditures, liquidity and growth, underpinned by revolving credit facilities sized to provide additional funding in the event of operating asset losses. NEE, FPL and NEECH monitor and maintain investment-grade credit ratings, as facility commitment fees, borrowing costs and collateral requirements under supply, trading and decommissioning arrangements are contingent on ratings and could be accelerated in the event of a downgrade. Guarantee arrangements, letters of credit and surety bonds secure obligations under power purchase and transmission agreements, nuclear decommissioning and trading activities. NEE employs energy, interest-rate and foreign-currency derivative instruments—measured using market and income approaches—to hedge commodity price exposures, optimize asset portfolios and mitigate earnings volatility, with FPL deferring fair-value changes in energy derivatives as regulatory assets or liabilities and management excluding non-qualifying hedge impacts from adjusted earnings as a meaningful performance measure. Special use funds set aside for storm recovery and nuclear decommissioning are invested in diversified fixed-income and equity securities, with fair-value changes recorded in regulatory accounts or other comprehensive income. Asset retirement obligations for nuclear units and generation plant dismantlement are accrued and funded over expected service lives based on regulator-approved studies. Under cost-based rate regulation, NEE records regulatory assets and liabilities for probable future recovery or refund of fuel, O&M, storm restoration and plant investment costs, periodically adjusting reserve amortization to achieve targeted regulatory ROEs. Strategic acquisitions, including the GridLiance transmission utilities, and ongoing investments in wind, solar and battery storage capacity demonstrate the company’s dynamic resource deployment, adaptation to environmental disruptions and commitment to emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

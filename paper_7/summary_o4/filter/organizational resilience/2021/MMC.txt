In management’s discussion and analysis, the firm highlights its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under internal and external variations, maintaining positive adjustment in dynamic and complex environments, as evidenced by resilient performance during the COVID-19 pandemic, swift deployment of remote work protocols and phased return-to-office guidelines, and sustained demand amid uncertain health mandates. The company’s systemic perspective on risk and mitigation is demonstrated through the integration of JLT—encompassing technology and process reconfiguration, real estate rationalization and legal-entity restructuring—to secure business continuity and extract cost savings, alongside continuous management of contingent consideration liabilities via fair-value remeasurement. Financial resilience is further supported by maintaining a $2.8 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility with successor-rate provisions and designating euro-denominated notes as net investment hedges to mitigate currency shocks. Operating segment resilience is realized through dynamic resource allocation, pricing initiatives, retention strategies and geographic diversification across 130 countries, with fiduciary funds segregated to safeguard liquidity and client continuity. Legal and other loss contingencies are actively monitored through case-level reviews and actuarial modelling to mitigate errors and omissions exposures, while long-term strategic adaptation is embodied in defined benefit pension funding policies, sensitivity-tested actuarial assumptions and proactive global liquidity repatriation and reinvestment planning. These interconnected strategies encapsulate the organization’s capacity to respond effectively to disruptive events, reconfigure trajectories of response and reconstitute operations to emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

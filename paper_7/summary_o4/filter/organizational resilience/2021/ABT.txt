In 2020 and 2021, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic affected Abbott’s diversified health care businesses in various ways, as some businesses performed at the levels required to successfully meet new demands, others faced challenges during periods of elevated COVID-19 cases, and still others were relatively less impacted by the pandemic. In response, Abbott mobilized its teams across multiple fronts to develop and launch various new diagnostic tests for COVID-19, ensured that its global operations were aligned with specific governmental orders and enhanced the safety of facilities for its employees, and managed supply chain challenges without significant disruption or shortage of services, raw materials and supplies, while partially mitigating inflationary pressures through price increases and gross-margin improvement initiatives. On May 27, 2021, Abbott’s management approved a restructuring plan to align its manufacturing network for COVID-19 diagnostic tests with changes in projected testing demand driven by significant reductions in cases in developed countries, the accelerated rollout of vaccines and updated public health guidance, under which in the second quarter of 2021 Abbott recorded $499 million of charges, including fixed asset write-downs, inventory-related charges and exit costs, and in the second half of the year sold approximately $181 million of inventory previously estimated to have no net realizable value and reduced exit cost estimates by $58 million, leaving $23 million of accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2021. Abbott maintained readily available financial resources, including unused lines of credit supporting up to $5 billion of unsecured borrowings, and believed its available cash and cash equivalents, together with operating cash flow and access to debt markets, to be sufficient to fund existing and planned cash requirements, with annual cash flow from operating activities expected to continue to exceed capital expenditures and cash dividends. At December 31, 2021, working capital was $11.1 billion, reflecting higher cash balances partially offset by the classification of $750 million of senior notes due 2022 as current liabilities, and Abbott continued to monitor customer creditworthiness and establish allowances for credit losses based on historical trends, aging analysis and forward-looking information. For 2022, Abbott will focus on continuing to meet demand for COVID-19 tests and will continue to invest in product development areas that provide the opportunity for strong sustainable growth over the next several years.

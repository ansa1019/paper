Applied Materials responded quickly to the Covid-19 pandemic by implementing precautionary measures to keep its workplaces healthy and safe and ensure compliance with government orders, supporting workplace flexibility through remote working where possible, enhanced health protocols—including screenings, social distancing and personal protective equipment—and a multi-phase return-to-site plan that considers its business and employee needs, local regulations, community case trends and public health guidance. The company continues to monitor and evaluate the ongoing pandemic and to respond appropriately to its impact on its operations, customers, suppliers and communities, while actively managing near-term supply chain constraints as a top priority. To sustain performance and competitive advantage under volatile industry conditions, Applied maintains significant investments in research, development and engineering to assure the availability of innovative technology before strong demand emerges, works closely with global customers to design systems and processes that meet planned technical and production requirements, and grows its services business in response to shifts in customer spending. It realigns workforce capacity through a one-time voluntary retirement program and other workforce reduction actions globally, manages credit risk by selling accounts receivable without recourse and discounting letters of credit, and preserves financial resilience by monitoring its investment portfolio, leveraging cash generated from operations alongside credit facilities and borrowing capability, and exercising discretion over capital expenditures, debt refinancing, share repurchases and dividends to ensure operational continuity and adaptability under changing market and environmental conditions.

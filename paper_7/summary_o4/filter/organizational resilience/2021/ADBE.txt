In preparing its consolidated financial statements, management regularly evaluates its assumptions, judgments and estimates and discusses its critical accounting policies with the audit committee, acknowledging that actual results could differ materially under different assumptions or conditions, and in connection with acquisitions it makes significant estimates of intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations while recognizing that unanticipated events may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the company’s focus has remained on promoting employee health and safety, serving customers and ensuring business continuity by carefully assessing conditions on a case-by-case basis to determine when employees can safely return to offices and resume travel and by implementing a reimagined framework for the future of work rooted in a flexible, hybrid model enabled by a digital-first mindset. The ongoing shift to a digital-first world has increased the importance of its solutions and contributed to continued year-over-year growth, supported by a predictable subscription-based business model, even as the duration of the pandemic and broader macro-economic recovery remain uncertain. To sustain resilience, management expects Creative Cloud to drive long-term revenue growth through continued customer base expansion and delivery of new features, and continues to implement strategies designed to accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions. The company employs a data-driven operating model and its Adobe Experience Cloud to raise product awareness, drive acquisition, engagement and retention, and optimize customer journeys, and uses annualized recurring revenue as a key metric to assess the health and trajectory of its digital media segment. Investments in research and development, including recruiting and hiring software developers, are deemed critical to remain competitive and support timely development of new and enhanced offerings. The company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, anticipated cash flows from operations and availability under its $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement—which contains a leverage covenant the company expects will not restrict its business plan—and its stock repurchase program, designed to return value to stockholders and minimize dilution with $10.7 billion remaining authorization, will be sufficient to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements. In the ordinary course of business, it provides indemnifications against third-party intellectual property claims and maintains director and officer insurance coverage to manage its exposure.

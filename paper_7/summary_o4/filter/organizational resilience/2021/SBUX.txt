Starbucks results for fiscal 2021 demonstrate the overall strength and resilience of our brand, with consolidated revenues increasing 24% primarily due to business recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and the extra week, and comparable store sales rising 22% in North America and 16% internationally despite pandemic-related restrictions that significantly impacted customer mobility. During fiscal 2021, we experienced supply shortages and transportation delays largely attributable to the pandemic and changes in customer demand, which we view as temporary and unlikely to have a material impact on our long-term growth and profitability, underscoring our operational continuity and risk mitigation capabilities. In fiscal 2020, we announced and substantially completed a restructuring plan to optimize our North America store portfolio by blending store formats in dense metropolitan markets to better cater to changing customer tastes and preferences, resulting in the closure of 807 stores, and in October 2021 we announced retail wage increases and enhanced benefits to attract and retain talent necessary to support continued growth—actions that reflect resource allocation, organizational health and adaptive strategies. We actively manage our cash and investments to internally fund operating needs, service debt, pursue strategic acquisitions and return cash to shareholders, including replacing our prior credit facilities with a new $3 billion unsecured five-year revolving facility to ensure financial flexibility. Our market price risk management policy governs the use of fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed coffee contracts, financial derivatives, interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and other instruments to mitigate commodity, interest rate and foreign exchange exposures, and we perform sensitivity analyses to inform decision making. Absent significant and prolonged COVID-19 relapses or global economic disruptions, and based on our focused efforts to elevate customer experiences, enhance digital capabilities and drive beverage innovation, we are confident in the durability of our long-term “growth at scale” strategy to deliver consistent revenue and income growth, reflecting our ability to absorb strain and maintain performance under challenging conditions.

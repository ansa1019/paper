Charles Schwab’s annual report describes a multifaceted approach to preserving positive adjustment under challenging conditions by embedding resilience into its governance, risk management and operational infrastructures.  The board-approved enterprise risk management (ERM) framework, which incorporates the firm’s purpose, vision and values, sets clear risk appetite and governance through senior management and board-level committees and mandates structured processes for risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting, and risk mitigation controls.  To protect critical business functions and technology systems from disruptions—including natural disasters, cyberattacks, system interruptions, extreme weather or power failures—Schwab maintains a backup and recovery infrastructure comprising redundant facilities for backup and communications, a geographically dispersed workforce, routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans, and a well-established incident management program.  Third-party risk is similarly managed through internal policies, procedures and controls, contractual provisions, performance monitoring and targeted testing of service providers, thereby embedding resiliency across key outsourced functions.  Liquidity resilience is achieved through diversified funding sources, overnight cash deposits, highly liquid investments such as U.S. Treasury securities, access to committed and uncommitted lines of credit and regular stress testing of 30-day net cash outflows under acute scenarios.  Capital resilience is underpinned by policies to remain well capitalized in stressed scenarios, regular capital stress testing of adverse macroeconomic and firm-specific events and a comprehensive capital contingency plan for low-probability, high-impact events.  Integration of TD Ameritrade included aligning its risk management practices with Schwab’s risk appetite, evaluating evolving risks across the combined entity and committing to continued technology enhancements, workforce redeployment and facility optimization to reconfigure operations and realize synergies.  Preparations for the phase-out of LIBOR, led by a firm-wide transition team overseen by executive leadership, ensure that financial instruments, systems and client communications are updated with fallback provisions and alternate reference rates.  These measures collectively enable Schwab to absorb strain, maintain integrity and performance despite internal or external pressures, and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

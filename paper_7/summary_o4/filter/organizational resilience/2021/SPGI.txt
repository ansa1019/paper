Management continues to closely monitor the evolving impact of COVID-19 and associated macroeconomic changes on all aspects of the business, noting that while COVID-19 did not materially affect our 2021 and 2020 results, its ultimate effect on our operations, financial condition and cash flows remains uncertain. We maintain a strong financial position with cash generated from operations, cash on hand and committed credit facilities expected to meet foreseeable operating needs, and we deploy these resources across ongoing investments in our businesses, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends, debt repayments, capital expenditures and infrastructure. Our “Powering the Markets of the Future” strategic framework guides forward-looking initiatives to enhance foundational capabilities, evolve and grow core businesses, pursue disciplined organic, inorganic and partnership strategies and deliver exceptional, differentiated customer experiences. We enhance operational flexibility by improving tools and processes to service customers, extend analytics capabilities, support data-driven decisions and improve productivity; by reimagining and implementing a hybrid office model through standardized technology; by advancing technical capabilities, data transformation and next-generation products; and by maintaining rigorous risk management, control and compliance across the enterprise. We apply forward-looking assumptions in our allowance for doubtful accounts—incorporating historical analysis, customer risk profiles and forecasted industry default rates—and we evaluate long-lived and intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate carrying values may not be recoverable, recognizing charges based on estimated fair values using market evidence and discounted cash flows. We assess and record liabilities for litigation and other contingencies when a loss is probable and estimable, accruing our best estimate and disclosing the range of possible outcomes. Pension and postretirement obligations are funded and evaluated using assumptions regarding discount rates and expected asset returns, and we perform annual fair-value analyses of redeemable noncontrolling interests using income and market approaches that incorporate projected cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. These ongoing processes of monitoring, resource allocation, strategic adaptation and risk mitigation collectively support our ability to absorb strain, preserve performance and maintain enterprise integrity under challenging and uncertain conditions.

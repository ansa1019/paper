Boeing acknowledges that the global outbreak of COVID-19 caused an unprecedented shock to demand for air travel, creating a tremendous challenge to the business and the entire commercial aerospace manufacturing and services sector, and as a result it reduced the production rates of several programs based on ongoing assessments of the demand environment and availability of aircraft financing, maintains a disciplined rate management process and makes adjustments as appropriate, monitors the health and stability of its extensive supply chain network of non-U.S. partners, key suppliers and subcontractors as it ramps up production, and has undertaken transformations and improvements to its business processes to emerge stronger and more resilient when the market recovers; to balance supply and demand given the COVID-19 shock and preserve long-term competitiveness, it has reduced production rates, adjusted estimates regarding timing of new aircraft entries into service such as the 777X, closely monitors backlog drivers including customersâ€™ evolving fleet plans, the wide-body replacement cycle and the cargo market, and continues engagement with regulators and detailed discussions with customers to reconfigure delivery schedules; as part of its liquidity management, Boeing has significantly increased its cash, short-term investments and unused borrowing capacity, taken significant actions to preserve liquidity including using stock to fund pension and 401(k) contributions, and expects to fund cash requirements through those resources with undrawn revolving credit lines serving as backup liquidity; management applies program and long-term contract accounting processes incorporating systematic and logical methods to estimate revenues, costs and margin trajectories for each program quarter-to-quarter, thereby enabling early recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments and reach-forward losses when estimated costs exceed revenues; the company continually monitors global trade developments, environmental regulations and geopolitical risks that could impact its supply chain and market, leverages its core earnings and cash flow generation to invest in new products and services, and projects demand over a 20-year horizon to support disciplined resource allocation, all of which reflect an ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to conduct business with substantial modifications to employee work locations and employee travel, and while we have not experienced significant disruptions to our operations from the pandemic, we are unable to predict the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our operations and future financial performance. In August 2020, we reorganized certain technology and customer success functions that support and benefit our overall platform and, additionally, certain legal, facility and employee service costs are now managed at the corporate level, demonstrating our capability to reconfigure resources and realign cost structures to preserve functioning under changing conditions. To remain competitive and continue to grow, we are investing significant resources in our product development, marketing, and sales capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future; as we offer more online services, the ongoing operation and availability of our platforms and systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important. We are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future; for our consumer and professional tax offerings, we have implemented additional security measures and are continuing to work with state and federal governments to implement industry-wide security and anti-fraud measures, including sharing information regarding suspicious filings. We received ISO 27001 certification for a portion of our systems and we continue to invest in security measures and to work with the broader industry and government to protect our customers against this type of fraud. Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash from operations, which includes the collection of accounts receivable for products and services, the issuance of senior unsecured notes, and borrowings under our credit facilities, and our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs, selling and marketing activities, repurchases of our common stock, payment of cash dividends, debt service costs and debt repayment, acquisitions of businesses, and capital projects. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, commitments, debt service requirements, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months, and we believe the unsecured revolving credit facility will be available to us should we choose to borrow under it.

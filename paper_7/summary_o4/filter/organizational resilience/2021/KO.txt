Throughout the pandemic, business continuity and adapting to the needs of our customers have been critical and we have developed systemwide knowledge-sharing routines and processes, including the management of any supply chain challenges, and to date have experienced no material impact and do not foresee a material impact on our or our bottling partners’ ability to manufacture or distribute our products. While uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic remain—and factors such as the state of the supply chain, labor shortages and the inflationary environment are likely to impact the pace of the economic recovery—we expect to continue to see improvements in our business as we continue to learn and adapt to the ever-changing environment. The pandemic helped us realize we could be much bolder in our efforts to change, and to navigate the pandemic and position us to capture growth we identified key objectives of winning more consumers, gaining market share, maintaining strong system economics, strengthening stakeholder impact and equipping the organization to win. To deliver against these objectives, we focused on unlocking the potential of our portfolio of strong global, regional and scaled local brands; developing a robust innovation pipeline focusing on scalable initiatives; increasing consumer-centric marketing effectiveness and efficiency; winning in the marketplace with aligned data-driven revenue growth management and execution capabilities; and further embedding ESG goals into our operations. In August 2020, the company announced strategic steps to transform our organizational structure to better enable us to capture growth in the fast-changing marketplace, transforming into a networked global organization designed to combine the power of scale with the deep knowledge required to win locally. We will remain flexible so that we can adjust to uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of the fundamental strengths of our business and, together with our commercial paper program, long-term debt issuances, cash balances and available credit facilities, provides liquidity we expect will be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for the foreseeable future. We review our payment terms with suppliers, extending terms to 120 days and offering a supply chain finance program, to improve working capital efficiency, and our foreign currency management program is designed to mitigate, over time, a portion of the potentially unfavorable impact of exchange rate changes on net operating revenues and income before taxes.

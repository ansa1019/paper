The company’s discussion highlights its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under external pressures by deploying strategic initiatives and adapting operational processes to maintain positive adjustment in challenging conditions. Throughout fiscal 2021, the company advanced its total home strategy by enhancing omnichannel fulfillment—expanding the online assortment, upgrading search and visualization tools, launching same-day and next-day delivery options, and converting select markets to a direct-to-home delivery model—while improving in-store execution with a new inventory management system that provides real-time visibility and a simplified user interface to reduce non-productive hours and accelerate associate training. Cash flows from operations, supplemented by $1.1 billion of cash and equivalents and $4.0 billion in undrawn revolving credit capacity, remain sufficient to fund operations, strategic investments, share repurchases, and dividends, thereby supporting business continuity and financial flexibility amid rising interest rates and inflation. Capital expenditures, totaling $1.9 billion in 2021 and forecasted at $2.0 billion in 2022, are allocated toward strategic focus areas to enhance customer service and support expansion plans. The company’s debt management, including issuance of $4.0 billion of unsecured notes and amendments to revolving credit agreements, provides access to short- and long-term funding to mitigate market volatility and preserve system integrity. Risk mitigation and resilience mechanisms, such as self-insurance programs with excess coverage, rigorously maintained merchandise inventory and shrinkage reserves, and quarterly reviews for long-lived asset impairment based on undiscounted cash flows and fair value assessments, underscore the organization’s dynamic capabilities to respond effectively to disruptive events, reconfigure resources, and sustain performance under uncertainty.

Following the Allergan acquisition, AbbVie implemented an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization, targeting approximately $2.5 billion of annual cost synergies in 2022 and incurring cumulative charges of about $2 billion through workforce severance and other integration expenses; in response to the COVID-19 public health crisis, the company has followed local health guidance, implemented safety measures for returning employees, closely managed global manufacturing and supply chain resources to ensure uninterrupted medicine supply, monitored clinical trial sites to protect participants and staff and adjusted expectations for lower new patient starts and evolving pandemic impacts; its 2022 strategic objectives further signal resilience through diversification of revenue streams, leveraging commercial strength and international infrastructure, continued investment in and expansion of its pipeline, expansion of operating margins via expense synergies, supply-chain productivity initiatives and efficiency programs across manufacturing, commercial infrastructure and administrative functions, and disciplined capital allocation that includes debt reduction and a growing dividend; AbbVie’s financial flexibility is underscored by compliance with its $4 billion revolving credit facility, the ability to generate strong operating cash flows, early repayment of higher-cost debt, share repurchases under an open-market program and prudent liquidity management; credit risk is mitigated through ongoing customer creditworthiness monitoring, allowance for credit losses and potential use of factoring arrangements; collaborative, licensing and milestone payment arrangements are treated as positive indicators of successful development trajectories; and critical accounting judgments—such as estimating variable consideration for rebates and chargebacks using internal and external data, annual impairment assessments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles based on discounted cash flow analyses under macroeconomic and market assumptions, and fair valuation of contingent consideration liabilities via probability-weighted models and Monte Carlo simulations—ensure the maintenance of system integrity and performance amid internal and external variations.

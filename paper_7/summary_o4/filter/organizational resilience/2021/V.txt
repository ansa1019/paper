Visa’s 2021 Form 10-K illustrates its capacity to maintain secure, reliable and efficient electronic payment operations across more than 200 countries through its VisaNet authorization, clearing and settlement network, thereby preserving business continuity and organizational functioning under both nominal and extreme conditions. In response to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic—characterized by uncertainty around transmissibility, variants, public health measures and economic recovery—the company prioritized employee, client and community safety, adopted a phased office reopening with widespread remote work, and maintained close coordination with stakeholders to navigate these challenging times, while continuously evaluating the pandemic’s impacts on its operations, clients, suppliers and partners. Treasury policies are designed to manage liquidity risk under contingency scenarios by ensuring adequate resources for operating expenditures, payment settlements, planned capital investments, dividends and share repurchases, with excess cash and available-for-sale securities held to meet working-capital needs; as of September 30, 2021, Visa held $16.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $3.2 billion in debt securities, access to a $3 billion commercial paper program and a $5 billion revolving credit facility, and projected that these sources would satisfy its liquidity requirements for more than 12 months. Payment settlement obligations to financial institution clients can represent substantial daily liquidity demands, yet during fiscal 2021 Visa did not fund settlement-related working capital, instead holding $9.1 billion to cover potential client settlement failures; moreover, Visa indemnifies clients for settlement losses up to the amount of unsettled transactions and enforces collateral requirements under global settlement-risk policies. The resilience of Visa’s operating model is further evidenced by long-term incentive agreements with financial institutions, merchants and partners—structured to drive volume growth and innovation and recognized systematically based on performance forecasts—by robust cash generation from operations, which rose to $15.2 billion despite COVID-19 headwinds, and by disciplined allocation of resources to capital expenditures, debt maturities, share repurchases and dividends. Finally, Visa’s integrated approach to risk mitigation—encompassing the management of uncertain tax positions, legal and regulatory contingencies under its U.S. and Europe retrospective responsibility plans, and the careful advancement of strategic acquisitions such as Tink and Currencycloud—demonstrates its ability to absorb external pressures, adapt its resource deployment and preserve organizational performance under challenging conditions.

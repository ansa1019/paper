We maintain a strong liquidity position and diversified funding sources, including cash on hand, cash flow from operations, commercial paper programs, back-up credit facilities and access to the long-term debt markets, to support our operating requirements, capital expenditures, dividend payments, share repurchases and other contractual obligations under varying economic conditions and to enable us to invest in the business, fund strategic initiatives and enhance our long-term positioning.  We follow a disciplined capital allocation framework that prioritizes reinvestment in the business—planning approximately $3.0 billion of capital expenditures in fiscal 2022, flexible to adjust in response to the economic environment—before returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and repurchases, with share repurchase authorizations of up to $20 billion and the ability to suspend or resume repurchases as conditions warrant.  Working capital management remains dynamic, with inventory levels increased during fiscal 2021 to support elevated demand and mitigate supply chain disruptions through adjustments to product mix, transportation cost pressures and vendor payment timing.  We utilize operating and finance leases to fund real estate needs, including stores and distribution centers, while monitoring lease obligations of $12.6 billion to preserve operational flexibility.  Critical judgments in valuing inventories under the retail inventory method and assessing long-lived asset recoverability incorporate current market conditions, anticipated demand, shrink estimates and assumptions about future sales, margins, economic conditions and competitive dynamics to identify potential impairment and recalibrate carrying values, thereby preserving performance integrity amidst internal or external variations.  Our capital management strategy, including issuance and repayment of senior notes, active interest rate swaps and the maintenance of committed credit facilities, is designed to ensure resilience against market volatility and to facilitate rapid responses to emerging challenges without compromising our financial condition.

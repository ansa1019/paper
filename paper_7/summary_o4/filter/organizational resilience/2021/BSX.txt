In managing the uncertainty, magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and related deferral of elective and semi-emergent procedures, management focused on the health and safety of patients, healthcare providers and employees while executing its mission of transforming lives through innovative medical solutions and preserving business continuity by deploying a global crisis management team to protect employees and customers, optimize operations and secure the supply chain. The company successfully implemented business continuity plans that included establishing a medical advisory group for employees, leveraging work-from-home infrastructure to facilitate social distancing and accelerating capabilities to provide remote physician support and has committed to monitoring its return-to-office strategy based on science and data. Recognizing the ongoing operational pressures, Boston Scientific took proactive steps to manage outstanding borrowings, preemptively amended financial covenants, implemented significant cost reduction initiatives, slowed planned capital expenditures and created a cross-functional strategic cash management team to optimize liquidity. As part of its global expansion strategy, management increased investment in emerging-market infrastructure to maximize opportunities and continues to invest in research and development to maintain a pipeline of new products capable of addressing sudden market disruptions. The company maintains diversified, short-term investments of excess cash to mitigate principal risk and preserve financial flexibility. While acknowledging that the pandemic may continue to burden performance, Boston Scientific affirms that its long-term fundamentals remain strong and that it will manage through these challenges with disciplined resource allocation, adaptive strategies and the winning spirit of its global team.

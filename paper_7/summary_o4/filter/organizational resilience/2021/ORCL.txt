Oracle’s corporate strategy emphasizes providing choice and flexibility in the deployment of its applications and infrastructure technologies—through on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid models—which facilitates business continuity and operational flexibility under varying environmental conditions and enables customers to adapt rapidly to changing demands. The company has introduced programs allowing customers to pivot existing licenses and support contracts to Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate and expand workloads, thereby enabling the preservation or improvement of functioning despite disruptions. To support positive adjustment under challenging conditions, Oracle continues to make significant investments in research and development, to increase data-center capacity and geographic footprint, and to execute an active acquisition program funded by internally generated cash flows, marketable securities, borrowings and equity issuance, ensuring the availability of financial and intellectual resources to reconfigure trajectories of growth. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company curtailed variable expenditures, including travel and marketing, and implemented a restructuring plan to improve cost structure and operations, while maintaining critical support renewals and services to sustain revenue streams. Liquidity and capital-resource management practices—including strong cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances, diversified financing through senior notes and a flexible stock repurchase program—provide resilience against market volatility, foreign currency fluctuations and governmental budgetary constraints. Management employs segment-level reporting, constant-currency disclosures and rigorous critical accounting policies—such as judgments in revenue recognition, business combination accounting and asset-impairment assessments—to mitigate risks, maintain system integrity and support sustained performance under both nominal and extreme conditions.

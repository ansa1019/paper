In response to fluctuating infection rates, evolving regulations and intermittent supply chain disruptions such as port congestion, semiconductor shortages and temporary manufacturing closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has increased its operational flexibility by monitoring macroeconomic conditions, projecting demand and infrastructure requirements globally, and deploying production, workforce and other resources accordingly to optimize and evolve its business and maintain continuity of deliveries and deployments. The Company continues to ramp production and expand manufacturing capacity at multiple gigafactories, innovate manufacturing techniques—including pioneering high-volume, low-cost structural battery pack methods—and implement workaround manufacturing and production design solutions under component constraints and labor shortages, while recognizing that these plans remain subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping operations across concurrent international projects. To mitigate delivery bottlenecks and maintain performance, the Company has increased exports from local factories, staffed and optimized its delivery, servicing and charging infrastructure, trained and onboarded skilled personnel for energy installations and improved service operations’ capability and efficiency. Capital and operating expenditures remain dynamic, with the pace of capital spend varying by project priorities, milestone achievement, production adjustments and global market conditions; the Company may correspondingly slow or accelerate spending to preserve liquidity, which has been bolstered by consistent net positive operating cash flows, improved working capital management and $17.58 billion of cash and cash equivalents (including $7.22 billion in foreign currencies) as of December 31, 2021, alongside $1.11 billion of available committed credit, proceeds from vehicle and energy product sales, debt facilities and potential equity offerings. The Company also adapts its investment strategy, including allocations to marketable securities and digital assets, as liquid alternatives to cash, recognizing the volatility in market prices, and expects to self-fund operations and strategic growth initiatives so long as macroeconomic factors remain supportive, thereby preserving system integrity, deploying resources prudently and maintaining performance under challenging and unforeseen conditions.

We saw a substantial reduction in da Vinci procedures in China and the U.S. as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent resurgences, with impacts varying widely by geography and procedure type, and we do not expect all markets, regions, and procedure types to recover at the same time or at the same pace. To support business continuity, in April 2020 we announced a customer relief program providing credits against service fees, deferring lease payments, and extending payment terms, while recognizing potential increased credit risks and implementing programs to monitor and mitigate those risks. As the pandemic progressed, customers in affected regions deferred system purchases or leases, resulting in unused capacity, yet in 2021 we experienced strong system demand as utilization levels recovered. Economies have been significantly impacted by the pandemic and local actions such as shelter-in-place orders and travel restrictions have further affected our sales and our ability to produce, ship products, and supply customers, while increased difficulties in obtaining component materials and logistics challenges have resulted in inflationary cost pressure in our supply chain; although these challenges have not materially impacted our ability to deliver product and services to our customers to date, continued shortages could result in failure to meet demand. We have responded by focusing on the health and safety of patients, customers, communities, and employees; supporting our customersâ€™ clinical, operational, and economic priorities to ensure continuity of supply by working with our suppliers and our distributors; securing our workforce economically; and continuing to invest in priority development programs while eliminating avoidable spend, remaining flexible in our return-to-office strategy to maintain productivity and culture. Within our integrated ecosystem, we aim to decrease variability by offering dependable, consistent functionality and an integrated user experience, leveraging digital solutions and system logs accessed by field engineers to improve outcomes, optimize efficiency, and personalize learning. Capital expenditures and inventory levels have been increased to mitigate disruption risks and to support growth, and we have broadened financing structures, including operating leases and usage-based arrangements, to provide customers flexibility and to manage financial uncertainties.

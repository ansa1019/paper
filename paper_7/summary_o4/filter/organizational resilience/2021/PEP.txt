PepsiCo, as a leading global beverage and food company, encountered multiple disruptive events in 2021 including the COVID-19 pandemic, climate crisis, supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, shifting consumer preferences, a competitive operating environment, macroeconomic and political volatility, and retail landscape changes. To sustain operations and preserve performance under these extreme conditions, the company implemented health and safety protocols, business continuity and crisis management plans and leveraged an integrated risk management framework, comprising board oversight, cross-functional Pepsico Risk Committee, divisional and market risk committees, a risk management office, corporate audit, and compliance programs to identify, assess, prioritize and mitigate strategic, financial, operating, compliance, safety, and reputational risks. The 2019 multi-year productivity plan and extended technology, process and supply chain simplification initiatives, together with fixed-price contracts, global purchasing programs and derivative-based hedging strategies, illustrate organizational flexibility and resource reconfiguration to absorb strain and maintain system integrity. Through the Pep+ end-to-end transformation strategy, which embeds sustainability across positive agriculture, value chain and portfolio choices, and through digital transformation efforts including e-commerce expansion and ERP deployment, PepsiCo has sought to adapt to environmental perturbations, mitigate fragmentation, and build competitive advantage. The company’s liquidity and capital resource management, including diversified funding sources, free cash flow deployment, and divestitures such as the juice transaction alongside strategic acquisitions, reflect dynamic capabilities for resource allocation and reconstituting operational trajectories in response to evolving external demands. Adjustments to pension and retiree medical plans, workforce engagement programs, and supply chain finance arrangements further demonstrate resilience engineering in human capital and supply relationships, collectively supporting PepsiCo’s ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change to sustain positive adjustment and emerge stronger from challenging situations.

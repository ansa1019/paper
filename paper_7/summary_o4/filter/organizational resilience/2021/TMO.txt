The company mobilized in early 2020 to support the COVID-19 pandemic response with products and services that help analyze, diagnose and protect from the virus, and despite a significant reduction in customer activity in several businesses by late March 2020 that materially adversely affected primarily the 2020 results of the analytical instruments segment, the negative impact significantly lessened in 2021 as life sciences solutions, specialty diagnostics and laboratory products businesses continued to support COVID-19 diagnostic testing, scaling and evolving their molecular diagnostics solutions and plastic consumables businesses to respond to the ongoing pandemic. The biosciences and bioproduction businesses also expanded their capacity to meet the needs of pharma and biotech customers as they rapidly expanded their own production volumes to meet global vaccine manufacturing requirements, and through our pharma services business we provided our customers with the services they needed to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally, although the duration and extent of future revenues remain uncertain and dependent on customer testing and therapy demand. The company continues to execute its proven growth strategy, which consists of developing high-impact, innovative new products, leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers, and has made strategic growth investments—targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, research and development projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience, as well as incentive compensation and recognition for employees—to support both near- and long-term growth. Productivity improvements, reflecting improved cost efficiencies from our Practical Process Improvement business system, including continuous improvement methodologies, global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following facility consolidations and headcount reductions, and low-cost region manufacturing, have further bolstered our operational flexibility. To underpin business continuity and risk mitigation, the company’s proven growth strategy has enabled it to generate free cash flow as well as access the capital markets; deploy capital primarily via mergers and acquisitions and secondarily via share buybacks and dividends; manage approximately half of its cash balances and cash flows outside the U.S. for needs such as acquisitions, capacity expansion and debt repayment; and maintain existing cash and cash equivalents and future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for at least the next 24 months. Major acquisitions during 2021—including the European viral vector manufacturing business of Groupe Novasep, Mesa Biotech’s PCR-based point-of-care testing platform, the assumption of operating responsibility of a new biologics manufacturing facility in Switzerland, PPD’s global clinical research services and PeproTech’s recombinant proteins business—have reconfigured and expanded the company’s capabilities, reflecting a systemic perspective on resource deployment and adaptability under external pressures.

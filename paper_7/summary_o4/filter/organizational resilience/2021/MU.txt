In the year under review, the Company exhibited organizational resilience through proactive management of supply chain disruptions—anticipating adverse impacts on bit shipments due to non-memory component shortages and internal constraints—while continuously evaluating alternatives to fund capital expenditures and ongoing operations via revolving credit facilities, term loans and partner contributions to ensure business continuity. The firm mitigated credit risk by investing through high-credit-quality institutions and limiting concentration, adapted its inventory costing from average cost to FIFO and applied lower-of-cost-or-net-realizable-value adjustments based on projected selling prices and volumes to preserve operational flexibility amid market volatility, and extended the estimated useful lives of NAND and R&D equipment to align with technology transitions, thereby reducing depreciation expense and conserving resources. Strategic resource reconfiguration included ceasing development of certain technologies, classifying assets as held for sale and recognizing a $435 million restructuring charge to reconstitute its asset base toward future objectives, while ongoing manufacturing cost reductions and deployment of advanced technologies supported margin improvement despite declines in average selling prices. Disciplined working capital and debt management yielded a $4.2 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities versus the prior year and reflected targeted share repurchases, debt repayments and strategic debt issuances in financing activities, reinforcing the Company’s capacity to absorb strain, maintain integrity and sustain performance under external pressures.

The annual report’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis emphasizes forward-looking planning under uncertainty through statements reflecting the Company’s plans, estimates and beliefs and the use of non-GAAP measures such as constant currency revenue and free cash flow to provide investors with supplemental insights and operational transparency. It acknowledges external pressures and the need for risk mitigation, noting that future advertising revenue growth will continue to be adversely affected by regulatory changes and third-party mobile operating system limitations, and describes the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on operations, including business slowdowns and shutdowns in certain regions as well as significant increases in user engagement, while recognizing the volatility and uncertainty of future trends. In response to competitive and environmental disruptions, the Company introduced new product features such as Reels and plans additional investments in data center capacity, servers, network infrastructure, office facilities and headcount across engineering, technical, marketing and administrative functions to support user growth, service delivery, Reality Labs initiatives and organizational scaling, anticipating that capital expenditures in 2022 may range from $29 billion to $34 billion and that expense growth may exceed revenue growth, thereby impacting operating margins. The Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates under U.S. GAAP involve significant judgment to account for highly uncertain matters, including assessments of principal versus agent in revenue recognition, fair value measurements and impairment testing for equity investments, goodwill, long-lived assets and intangible assets, tax contingencies, legal contingencies, and changes in estimated useful lives of servers and network assets, which in 2021 reduced depreciation expense by $620 million and increased net income by $516 million. Continuous qualitative assessments identify triggering events for impairment, and liabilities are accrued and reviewed regularly when losses are probable and reasonably estimable. Resource deployment strategies include the continuation of a share repurchase program with $38.79 billion remaining authorized as of December 31, 2021, and maintenance of $48.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities—$10.61 billion of which is held by foreign subsidiaries and available for distribution without incremental U.S. taxes—supporting operational continuity, financial resilience and strategic flexibility. The Company also relies on complex techniques, algorithms and machine learning models to estimate unique daily and monthly active people metrics, calibrating these models against internal reviews and survey data and acknowledging margins of error of approximately 3% to measure engagement and size of its community. Contractual obligations, including operating lease commitments totaling $25.41 billion and multi-year renewable energy and server component agreements estimated at $8.06 billion, are monitored to ensure sufficient liquidity, business continuity and resilience in the face of environmental and market perturbations.

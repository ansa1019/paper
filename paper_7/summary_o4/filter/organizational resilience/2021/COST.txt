In our MD&A, management highlights that it “has been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items and through online offerings,” reflecting operational flexibility and resource reconfiguration to maintain performance under competitive and economic pressures; our philosophy “is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices” and “seek to maintain … a perception among our members of our ‘pricing authority’ on quality goods,” supported by investments in merchandise pricing strategies, which may include reducing prices to drive sales or holding prices steady despite cost increases to preserve customer loyalty, while leveraging increased sales to reduce SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales; we deploy a consistent operating model across U.S., Canadian and other international segments to absorb fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in gasoline prices, achieving net sales growth by opening new warehouses—where the “negative aspects of such growth … are continuing to decline in significance”—thus illustrating adaptive responses to market expansion challenges; pandemic-related supply and logistics constraints have been addressed through incremental wages, adjusted staffing costs and continuing capital expenditure plans, including managing delays in real estate and construction activities due to COVID-19; we maintain operational continuity and resilience through self-insurance mechanisms for employee health care, workers’ compensation and other exposures, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and reinsurance program, and by basing critical accounting estimates on historical experience and ongoing review to mitigate risks from inflation, tariffs and other external pressures; furthermore, management believes that “our cash and investment position and operating cash flows as well as capacity under existing and available credit agreements will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future,” underscoring preparedness and capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adversity.

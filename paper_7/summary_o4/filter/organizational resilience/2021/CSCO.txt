During fiscal 2021, Cisco delivered growth in revenue in a very challenging environment as customers accelerated their digitization and cloud investments stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic; the company focused on executing and innovating to support that transition and saw customers prepare for office re-openings and hybrid work by increasing investments in their technologies. To address industry-wide supply chain constraints and component shortages caused in part by the pandemic, Cisco partnered with several of its key suppliers utilizing volume purchasing, extended supply coverage and revised supplier arrangements, while leveraging productivity improvements—including component redesign, board configuration, test process enhancements, expedited freight and overtime—to optimize access to critical components, mitigate extended lead times and preserve product gross margin. During this extraordinary time, Cisco’s priority has been supporting its employees, customers, partners and communities, enabling a seamless transition to work from home under a long-standing flexible work policy, building technologies that allow organizations to stay connected, secure and productive, ensuring health and safety for those required on site, and providing free offers and trials for Webex and security technologies along with technology and financial support for non-profits, first responders and governments. The company is moving toward a hybrid work model that gives employees flexibility to work offsite or at onsite locations, reflecting organizational agility and resilience in sustaining operations under exceptional conditions. While the overall environment remains uncertain and highly competitive, Cisco continues to aggressively invest in priority areas to drive profitable growth over the long term and maintains a strong cash, cash equivalents and investments position—viewed as critical at this time of uncertainty—to fund strategic investments, acquisitions, customer financing activities, working capital needs and capital returns. Inventory and supply-chain management remain areas of focus as Cisco balances the need for competitive lead times with the risk of obsolescence by aligning inventory and purchase commitments with current demand forecasts to help ensure operational continuity. Financing programs, including leases, loans and financed service contracts—with certain guarantees in place for channel partners—are employed to facilitate working capital requirements and manage contingent liabilities under credit-market volatility. Finally, Cisco’s critical accounting estimates incorporate the economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, acknowledging that continued uncertainty may require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility, thereby demonstrating adaptive planning and foresight to maintain integrity and performance under ongoing disturbances.

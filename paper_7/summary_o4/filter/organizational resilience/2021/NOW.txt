ServiceNow emphasizes the resiliency of its operations and those of its customers through the now platform’s digital transformation capabilities, noting that integrated workflows “increase our customers’ resiliency and security and deliver great experiences” by connecting systems, silos, departments and processes with automation and connected activities. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, management reports its focus on “maintaining business continuity, helping our employees, customers and communities, and preparing for the future and the long-term success of our business,” and that operational changes implemented have not impaired and are not expected to impair its ability to “maintain operations, including financial reporting systems, internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.” The company highlights its history of positive operating cash flows—driven by subscription services paid in advance and a robust renewal rate of 98% over three years—and its free cash flow measure as an indicator of “the strength and performance of our business operations,” forecasting sufficient liquidity from operations, cash, cash equivalents and investments to meet obligations for at least the next 12 months. It also reports remaining performance obligations of $11.5 billion as of December 31, 2021, of which 49% is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months, reflecting a 29% increase year over year. To mitigate financial volatility, the company enters into short-term foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge exchange rate risks. It continually invests in data center capacity and infrastructure, adjusts the estimated useful life of data center equipment to improve operating income, and maintains a disciplined approach to capital expenditures, non-cancelable purchase commitments and long-term debt financing, all of which collectively support its capacity to absorb strain and sustain performance under internal and external pressures.

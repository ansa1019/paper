The Company’s MD&A describes a range of strategic and operational measures that collectively support its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions. It emphasizes active portfolio management through targeted acquisitions and dispositions designed to align business assets with client demands and market dynamics, as well as disciplined capital allocation, integration of newly acquired capabilities and elimination of duplicative costs to achieve revenue and cost synergies. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company implemented travel restrictions, safety protocols, remote working, supply-chain adaptations and vaccination requirements to maintain operational continuity and mitigate external hazards. The evolution of the global payments landscape and heightened regulatory and cybersecurity pressures have driven the modernization of technology, expansion of digital and data capabilities, and delivery of non-discretionary, recurring services to safeguard client operations and ensure scalable revenue growth. Liquidity and capital resource initiatives—including generating robust operating cash flows, maintaining committed revolving credit and commercial paper facilities, utilizing receivables securitization and a term loan, and proactively managing debt maturities and financial covenants—demonstrate its preparedness to reconfigure funding trajectories under adverse economic conditions. The Company’s comprehensive risk management framework, encompassing critical accounting judgments, impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets, income tax positions and contingent liabilities related to joint-venture guarantees, further underpins its capacity for positive adjustment, performance maintenance and resilience in the face of internal or external variations.

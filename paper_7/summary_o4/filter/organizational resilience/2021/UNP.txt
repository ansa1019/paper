In 2021, the company navigated a series of internal and external disturbances—from the covid-driven semiconductor shortage and intermodal supply-chain congestion to winter storms, wildfires, mudslides and hurricanes—by continuously adapting its operational plans and resource deployment to preserve network integrity and maintain service performance; safety procedures and policies were refined in accordance with CDC guidelines through a multi-faceted total safety culture program (including “courage to care,” coaching, observing, mentoring, and peer-to-peer engagement), by implementing a proprietary physics engine for proactive derailment prevention, and by engaging a third-party expert to assess and enhance program effectiveness. Network fluidity was supported by temporarily maintaining higher crew and locomotive resources, recalibrating plans once stability was restored, and leveraging real-time data to mitigate variability, while productivity initiatives reduced headcount by 3% even as carloadings rose 4%. Financial resilience was reinforced by generating $9.0 billion of operating cash flow, preserving $960 million in cash, maintaining $2.0 billion of undrawn credit commitments and up to $500 million under a receivables facility, and conducting sensitivity analyses and scenario planning to ensure covenant compliance and liquidity through extended periods of lower volumes. The 2022 capital plan, increased by 10% to $3.3 billion, prioritizes hardening infrastructure, replacing aging assets, modernizing the locomotive fleet, targeted freight-car acquisitions and growth-related projects to improve operational efficiency and system robustness, with flexibility to revise investments as business conditions or regulations evolve. Concurrently, the company launched its initial climate action plan—aligned to improve operational efficiency and minimize fuel consumption, grow sustainable supply-chain solutions, decarbonize its footprint, and engage stakeholders—to bolster environmental resilience. These strategic initiatives and continuous risk assessments collectively support the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, reinforce the organization’s capability to absorb strain, and preserve or enhance performance across nominal, extreme and exceptional scenarios.

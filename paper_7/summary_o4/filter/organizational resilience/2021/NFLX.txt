The Company acknowledges that while most productions have resumed, certain of its own and third-party content production activities continue to experience disruption and that health and safety protocols, additional cast and crew compensation, personal protective equipment and testing requirements may arise; it will therefore actively monitor pandemic-related issues and may take further actions to alter its business operations as required by authorities or deemed in the best interests of employees, customers, partners and stockholders, although the full extent of any impacts on its members, suppliers, vendors or financial results cannot yet be accurately predicted. To preserve operational flexibility and continuity, the Company has built its own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) to efficiently stream a high volume of content, expects to test and adjust membership plan pricing variations over time, and anticipates that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources—including its $1 billion revolving credit facility—will continue to be sufficient to meet its cash needs for the next twelve months and beyond, with no amounts drawn under the revolving facility as of December 31, 2021. The Board has authorized a $5 billion common stock repurchase program with no expiration, to be executed through open-market purchases, trading plans under Rule 10b5-1, accelerated repurchase arrangements, block purchases or similar techniques in management’s discretion, subject to suspension at any time. The Company’s primary uses of cash are acquisition, licensing and production of content, marketing programs, streaming delivery and personnel-related costs, and it expects to continue significantly increasing its investments in global original content, which require more upfront cash relative to licensed content. Content assets—licensed and produced—are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets when the license period begins or a title is available for streaming or when production costs are incurred, capitalized at cost with a corresponding liability, and amortized on an accelerated basis over the shorter of each title’s contractual window of availability or estimated useful period (or ten years), based on historical and estimated viewing patterns; these assets are reviewed at a group level for changes in expected usefulness or fair value whenever events or circumstances indicate potential impairment, and management exercises considerable judgment in estimating amortization factors, contractual content obligations and content liabilities, acknowledging that actual results may differ from estimates. In assessing deferred tax assets, the Company applies the asset and liability method, considers all available positive and negative evidence— including past operating results, forecasts of future earnings and taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies—records valuation allowances for tax benefits that are not more likely than not to be realized, and measures recognized tax benefits based on the largest amount with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of sustainment upon examination, while recognizing that the ultimate settlement of uncertain tax positions may differ materially from current estimates.

Goldman Sachs’ 2021 Form 10-K emphasizes a holistic set of practices designed to enable the firm to “absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity,” beginning with the activation of a comprehensive business continuity planning (“BCP”) strategy in early 2020 that sought to safeguard employees and ensure continuity of business operations on behalf of clients throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, underpinned by robust systems and infrastructure that enabled uninterrupted settlement and client service. A rigorous liquidity-risk framework pre-funds estimated cash and collateral outflows via “global core liquid assets” and a formally documented contingency funding plan, each subject to firmwide and subsidiary-level stress testing—including modeled liquidity outflows, intraday stressed funding needs and multi-year recovery paths—which identifies potential risk factors, key metrics, mitigation strategies and communication protocols to manage crisis agency and sudden market dislocations. Capital adequacy is managed through a disciplined, forward-looking capital planning process and annual regulatory stress tests under both firm-designed and supervisory severely adverse scenarios to ensure sufficient loss-absorbing capacity and compliance with ratios and buffers; attribution of equity to business segments; and dynamic adjustments via open-market share repurchases or subordinated debt issuances. Risk is governed by a three-lines-of-defense model, with the Board and its Risk and Public Responsibilities Committees setting overall risk appetite; enterprise risk oversight ensuring integrated governance, policies and limits; and independent Risk, Compliance, Legal, Controls and Internal Audit functions conducting counterparty credit reviews, model validation, scenario and sensitivity analyses, stress tests, and limit monitoring to manage market, credit, operational, model, cyber-security and third-party risks. Supplementary committees oversee client standards, reputational risk, suitability, new activities, model risk, and Volcker rule compliance, while a firmwide Operational Risk and Resilience Committee coordinates crisis management, vendor risk, information security and business resilience activities. These processes, combined with real-time valuation of market positions, periodic VAR calculations and diversification assessments, proactive climate risk integration, and ongoing training and performance measures reinforcing reputational excellence and risk awareness, embody the organization’s adaptive strategies, resource allocation mechanisms, and operational flexibility that collectively constitute its approach to organizational resilience.

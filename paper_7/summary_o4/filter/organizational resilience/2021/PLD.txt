Prologis demonstrated maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions by adapting to surging e-commerce demand with 97.7 % O&M occupancy, accelerated leasing activity and retention of approximately 70 % of customers, while reconfiguring its property portfolio to generate $5.2 billion of net proceeds through contributions to unconsolidated co-investment ventures and third-party dispositions. The company preserved system integrity and performance by executing consolidated financing activities—issuing $2.9 billion and redeeming $1.5 billion of senior notes to extend maturities to ten years and lower its weighted-average effective interest rate to 1.6 %—and by expanding available liquidity to $5.0 billion via a second global senior credit facility, thereby reinforcing its operational flexibility and risk mitigation capacity. Through its strategic capital segment, Prologis absorbed currency and market variations by hedging foreign exchange exposures with natural hedges and derivative instruments, managing asset and property-level expenses, and earning promote revenues based on cumulative venture returns, all of which enhanced its ability to preserve functioning under external pressures. The firm continued to deploy resources for development and modernization—maintaining a $2.7 billion current investment, $2.0 billion of remaining TEI and increasing capital expenditures to add sustainable and efficient building features—while using same-store analyses to isolate recurring net operating income growth and remove noncash, one-time items, thus ensuring clear visibility into its core operating resilience. Liquidity planning draws on diversified cash sources from operating activities, venture fee income, equity commitments, borrowing capacity and asset dispositions to meet debt service, dividend, acquisition and development requirements, sustaining organizational health, adaptability to environmental perturbations and long-term continuity.

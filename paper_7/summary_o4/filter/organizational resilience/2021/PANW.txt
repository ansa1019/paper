The company “empowers enterprises, service providers, and government entities to secure all users, applications, data, networks, clouds and devices with comprehensive visibility and context continuously across all locations” and “delivers cybersecurity products covering a broad range of use cases, enabling our end-customers to secure their networks, remote and hybrid workforces, branch locations, and public and private clouds, and to advance their security operations centers,” thereby supporting business continuity and operational flexibility under evolving threat landscapes. It has instituted “a global work-from-home policy” and adopted a “flexwork initiative” to “actively monitor, evaluate, and respond to developments relating to COVID-19, which has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in continued significant global, social, and business disruption,” making further operational changes as required “in the best interests of our employees, end-customers, partners, suppliers, and stockholders” to preserve functioning and mitigate risk. The company “continues to invest in innovation and acquire businesses as we evolve and further extend the capabilities of our portfolio, as we believe that innovation and timely development of new features and products is essential to meeting the needs of our end-customers and improving our competitive position,” introducing several new offerings and integrating acquired assets to reconfigure resources and enhance system integrity. Management “monitors key financial metrics set forth in the tables below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies,” and considers “billings,” defined as total revenue plus the change in deferred revenue, to be “an important indicator of the health and visibility of our business.” Liquidity is maintained through “cash provided by operating activities, together with our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments,” which management believes “will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months” and supports organizational resilience under market volatility. Strategic initiatives such as an unsecured revolving credit facility and share repurchase authorizations provide financial flexibility, while management of “deferred revenue” and “deferred contract costs” enables consistent performance maintenance over contracted service periods. The company’s “field sales force that works closely with our channel partners” and its “two-tiered, indirect fulfillment model” facilitate resource deployment and adaptive response to diverse customer needs across geographies. Continuous evaluation of “future capital requirements” and potential equity or debt financings further underpin resilience strategies, ensuring the ability to absorb strain, mitigate external pressures, and preserve or improve functioning despite adverse and unexpected conditions.

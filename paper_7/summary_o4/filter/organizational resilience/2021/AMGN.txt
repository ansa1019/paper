In 2021, while meeting the challenges of a global pandemic and increased competition from biosimilars and generics, Amgen continued providing uninterrupted supplies of its medicines globally through the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic and accomplished its objectives while maintaining a strategic and disciplined approach to capital allocation and advancing its ESG efforts. Cash flows from operating activities of $9.3 billion supported investment in the business and the return of capital to shareholders, reflecting resource sufficiency and operational flexibility. The company’s human capital resource management is directed at attracting, motivating, developing and retaining talent to tackle the challenges of a discovery, development and commercialization enterprise, and a diverse and inclusive culture is viewed as fostering innovation to better serve patients. Amgen’s long-standing ambition to be environmentally responsible has led it to set and meet multi-year carbon, water and waste reduction targets while growing revenues, expanding production capacity and entering approximately 100 countries, and in January 2021 it announced new long-term environmental targets to 2027, demonstrating future orientation and systemic perspective. Since the onset of the pandemic, Amgen has closely monitored its effects on global operations, taken appropriate steps to minimize risks to employees—many of whom continue to work virtually in accordance with government health and safety protocols—and to date has maintained critical business operations and robust supply of medicines. The company continues to monitor emerging COVID-19 variants, working to mitigate effects on clinical study enrollment and evaluating impacts in all trial geographies while supporting active clinical sites in patient care and investigational drug supply, illustrating crisis management, risk mitigation and operational continuity. Despite ongoing uncertainty around vaccination efforts, potential government restrictions and demand volatility, Amgen believes that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources and access to financing remain adequate to satisfy working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements and to pursue capital-return and other strategic initiatives, underpinned by investment-grade credit ratings, a disciplined investment policy and diversified financing arrangements. The company’s strategy of integrated discovery research, external business development, strategic acquisitions and disciplined capital deployment is intended to maintain and strengthen its competitive position, while considerable resources devoted to R&D across research and early pipeline, later-stage clinical programs and marketed products acknowledge both the high uncertainty of successful product development and the need for adaptability to regulatory scrutiny, pricing pressures and market fluctuations. Amgen’s forward-looking statements, together with its detailed risk factors regarding product sales, regulatory activities, pricing, reimbursement, operational and market uncertainties, establish a proactive risk assessment framework designed to preserve performance and foster resilience under challenging conditions.

Throughout the management’s discussion and analysis, UPS describes how it maintains positive adjustment under challenging conditions by enhancing customer engagement through combining its integrated air and ground network with digital capabilities, investing in state-of-the-art facilities, acquiring time-critical and temperature-sensitive logistics and end-to-end return service providers, and announcing new strategic hubs to reach new markets and preserve service levels despite macroeconomic headwinds, geopolitical tensions and volume declines. Faced with inflationary pressures, shifts in consumer behavior and labor negotiations, the company has taken actions intended to right-size its business for the future and focus on key enablers of growth, including exploring strategic alternatives for its truckload brokerage business, reducing headcount through its “fit to serve” initiative to create a more efficient operating model and enhance responsiveness to changing market dynamics, and temporarily idling aircraft to better match capacity with demand. It applies variable fuel surcharges indexed to Department of Energy fuel price indices, supplements GAAP results with currency-neutral and adjusted non-GAAP measures to remove the effects of foreign exchange hedging activities and pension plan mark-to-market fluctuations, and deploys a disciplined, balanced approach to capital allocation—covering operating requirements, planned capital expenditures, pension contributions, potential acquisitions, and debt obligations—while maintaining access to commercial paper programs and capital markets to ensure adequate funding for material short- and long-term cash requirements. In its global small package and supply chain solutions segments, UPS leverages productivity initiatives and reductions in purchased transportation, accommodates contractual wage-rate increases under its new teamsters agreement, regains diverted volume following contract ratification, and anticipates gradual improvement in economic conditions and corresponding volume and revenue growth in 2024, thereby preserving operational continuity, enabling adaptation to evolving external pressures, and positioning the organization for continued investment in network enhancements and technology initiatives.

Net additions to property, plant and equipment were $1.3 billion in fiscal 2023 as we invested to enhance our global resiliency, and we expect capital expenditures of approximately $600 million to $800 million in fiscal 2024, to be funded with a combination of cash on hand, cash expected to be generated from future operations and existing and anticipated available short- and long-term financing. At October 28, 2023, our principal source of liquidity was $958.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $201.1 million was held in the United States and the balance in our foreign subsidiaries; we manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds held by foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness of repatriation, maintain highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, and continually monitor and diversify our credit exposure to minimize risk. We believe that our existing liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with our financing arrangements, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and dividend payments for at least the next twelve months. Inventory increased in fiscal 2023 as a result of our efforts to balance manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels to support forecasted sales and to respond to variations between forecasts and actual demand. The Q4 2023 realignment plan, consisting of voluntary and involuntary reductions-in-force and other cost-savings initiatives, was commenced to adjust our cost structure and business activities to better align with weaker market demand and continued economic uncertainty, and to make strategic workforce shifts necessary to achieve our long-term vision. We maintain a $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, a commercial paper program allowing up to $2.5 billion of short-term borrowings (of which $547.2 million was outstanding at October 28, 2023), and a stock repurchase program with $2.1 billion remaining, each of which provides flexibility to deploy resources for debt repayment, share repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures and working capital. Revenue increased 2% in fiscal 2023 on broad-based demand in the industrial and automotive end markets, partially offset by weaker consumer and communications markets and softer demand in China and Asia due to deteriorating macroeconomic conditions. Research and development expenses decreased 2% and remain critical to our future growth; we expect that continued commitment to R&D will be essential both to maintain product leadership with existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings.

In response to the Sprint merger, we performed rationalization activities to identify duplicative networks, backhaul services and other agreements, decommissioned certain small cell sites and distributed antenna systems, retired legacy networks and accelerated or terminated operating and financing leases to achieve merger synergies and cost efficiencies, and we began implementing restructuring initiatives—including contract termination costs associated with the rationalization of retail stores, distribution channels, duplicative network and backhaul services, severance costs and network decommissioning—to realize cost efficiencies by the first half of 2024; we continue to monitor macroeconomic trends, including potential economic recession, changes in the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and geopolitical risks such as the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas conflicts, and assess their potential impacts on expected credit loss activity and fair value estimates while maintaining fixed rates through long-term contracts to limit exposure to price inflation and interest rate volatility; our management discussion and analysis outlines the maintenance of operational continuity and financial flexibility through a $7.5 billion revolving credit facility, an unsecured short-term commercial paper program, off-balance-sheet sales of certain receivables and uncommitted financing lease facilities that support liquidity and capital resources; spectrum license auctions and license purchase agreements totaling billions of dollars demonstrate strategic resource allocation to build and upgrade our nationwide 5G network, with capital expenditures expected to decline in 2024 as integration efforts mature; we maintain compliance with all restrictive debt covenants under our long-term debt instruments, conduct detailed performance monitoring via non-GAAP measures such as adjusted EBITDA, core adjusted EBITDA, adjusted free cash flow, churn rates, postpaid ARPA and postpaid phone ARPU to evaluate customer retention, operational performance and strategic synergies, and we anticipate leveraging these financial and operational frameworks—including ongoing monitoring of working capital changes in accounts payable, accrued liabilities, operating lease right-of-use assets and equipment installment plan receivables—to preserve functioning, adaptability and growth under varying environmental and competitive pressures.

NVIDIA has implemented a range of measures to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including increasing supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, adding new vendors and entering into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to absorb strain and preserve functioning amid surging demand, export control changes and geopolitical tensions. To mitigate execution risk arising from greater purchase volumes and supply chain complexity, the company continuously manages product availability and costs through long-term commitments, non-cancellable orders, premiums and deposits to secure future supply and by forecasting customer demand with sensitivity to extended third-party manufacturing lead times and macroeconomic pressures such as inflation and capital-market volatility. The frequent and complex product transition cycles—characterized by simultaneous shipment of legacy and new architectures, accelerated launch cadences for data center and AI platforms, and evolving use cases like generative AI—have driven the build-in of inventory in advance of anticipated demand, active management of channel inventory, qualification processes and potential inventory provisions or impairments to maintain operational flexibility and mitigate financial volatility. The company is enhancing the resiliency and redundancy of its supply chain, diversifying manufacturing locations, broadening its vendor base and monitoring regional disruptions—including the impact of the Israel conflict on employee health and safety support, charitable expenses and potential operational disruptions—to ensure continuity of research, development and operations. Its liquidity and capital resource management framework—underpinned by $26.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, ongoing evaluation of access to external capital, targeted share repurchases to offset dilution, and planned funding of $3.5–4.0 billion in property and equipment investments alongside scheduled debt repayments—provides the financial flexibility required to adapt to regulatory, economic and competitive challenges, preserve performance under pressure and support strategic objectives.

During 2023, we discontinued our DVD-by-mail service with an immaterial impact on operations and financial results, illustrating our capacity to reconfigure business lines under changing conditions. Consolidated revenues grew 7% year-over-year and operating margin expanded three percentage points as revenues outpaced cost of revenues and marketing expenses, reflecting our ability to allocate resources effectively and maintain performance under external pressures. Streaming revenues increased due to membership growth and limited price changes, partially offset by plan-mix shifts and unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations, and we utilize non-GAAP constant currency revenue measures to analyze underlying trends absent such rate variability. We have built our own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) to efficiently stream high volumes of content, enhancing operational flexibility and system integrity. We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and changes in other assets and use it to assess liquidity for debt repayment, strategic acquisitions, investments, and stock repurchases, with free cash flow increasing significantly due to favorable working capital changes and reduced content payments. We anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing, including our $1 billion revolving credit facility, will meet our cash needs for the next twelve months and beyond, supporting business continuity. Content obligations recognized amounted to $7.1 billion with $14.6 billion unrecognized and an estimated $1 billion to $4 billion in future licensing commitments over the next three years, underscoring forward-looking resource commitments under uncertainty. Our share repurchase program, currently authorized up to $15 billion, provides strategic flexibility to return capital and adjust to market conditions. Technology and development expenses remained relatively flat to sustain service improvements, while marketing investments increased to support ongoing customer engagement and competitive positioning.

Starbucks notes that “we have seen the strength and resilience of our brand as well as strong customer demand across our portfolio, with revenue and operating margin growth in fiscal 2023,” reflecting its capacity to absorb pressures such as inflationary cost increases and unfavorable foreign currency translation. The reinvention plan launched in fiscal 2022 to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience, supported by previously committed investments in store partner wages and benefits, increased spend on partner training, acceleration of purpose-built store concepts and innovations in technologies, has improved partner retention and in-store operational efficiencies, driving sales leverage, pricing benefits and margin expansion. The Company actively manages its cash and investments to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments, fund acquisitions and return cash to shareholders, and believes that net future cash flows from operations, existing cash and investments, and its access to a $3.0 billion unsecured five-year revolving credit facility and $3.0 billion commercial paper program will be sufficient to finance core business requirements and shareholder distributions for at least the next 12 months, absent global economic disruptions. A market price risk management policy quantifies exposures to commodity price, foreign currency, equity security and interest rate risk and mitigates such exposures through hedging instruments, including commodity price hedges, cross-currency swaps, foreign exchange debt instruments, interest rate swaps and treasury locks, in order to preserve system integrity and maintain continuity of performance under challenging conditions. The sale of the Seattle’s Best Coffee brand for a $91.3 million pre-tax gain and disciplined capital allocation reflect the Company’s ability to reconfigure its asset portfolio, adapt to external pressures and maintain system resilience and sustainable, profitable growth over the long term.

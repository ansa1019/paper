Our strategic initiatives include driving continuous commitment to risk management, compliance and control across S&P Global and strengthening the security and resiliency of business-critical systems through the elimination of known risk areas vulnerable to threat actor exploitation, while creating a more sustainable impact. We continue strengthening data management capabilities for cross-enterprise value creation, ensuring data quality through governance, enhanced architecture and policy codification, and utilize advanced technologies to enhance data processing efficiency, precision and new insights. We have adopted efficient modern native cloud technologies and data services that align with customer needs and unlock new opportunities, and are formulating and executing an enterprise-wide AI strategy that accelerates innovation in our product offerings and drives the productivity of our people with common AI capabilities. We remain focused on enhancing customer support and seamless user experience—emphasizing ease of discoverability, distribution and delivery of our products and services and integrated capabilities—and on continuing to invest in customer-facing solutions and processes, while prioritizing key strategic relationships to drive enterprise alignment and account development. In pursuit of resilience, we seek to meet or exceed our organic revenue growth and EBITA margin targets, driving growth and superior shareholder returns through effective execution, active portfolio management and prudent capital allocation. We maintain a strong financial position—our primary source of funds is cash from operations, and cash on hand, operating cash flow and availability under our credit facility are expected to be sufficient to meet additional operating and recurring cash needs in the short term and into the foreseeable future, with our indebtedness-to-cash-flow covenant never exceeded. Through our “Powering Global Markets” framework, we strive to enhance our foundational capabilities, evolve and grow our core businesses and pursue growth via adjacencies, thereby supporting positive adjustment under challenging conditions and preserving organizational functioning despite internal or external disturbances.

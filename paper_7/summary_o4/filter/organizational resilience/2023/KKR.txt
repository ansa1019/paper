Our asset management and insurance businesses “are affected by the various market and economic conditions of the various countries and regions in which we operate” and “are expected to continue to have a substantial impact on our financial condition, results of operations and our business in various ways that we are unable to control, including our ability to make new investments, the valuations of the investments we manage, the amount of investment proceeds we realize when we exit our investments, the timing for such realization activity, our ability to fundraise or to sell our various investment and insurance products and services, and the level of our capital markets activities,” prompting the firm to adapt through diversified operations across geographies and asset classes. The discussion emphasizes the importance of “managing our liquidity and capital requirements” by focusing on cash flows from operating activities, investment realizations, fee revenues and “seeking to maintain access to sufficient liquidity through various sources,” as well as deploying capital flexibly to support new investment strategies and to meet obligations in both asset management and insurance segments. In the insurance business, Global Atlantic undertakes an annual “assumption review” to re-estimate reserves and policy liabilities under alternative mortality, lapse and market scenarios, “unlocking” impacts to “reconfigure trajectories toward the ensuing future,” and employs hedging programs—“Global Atlantic purchases equity futures primarily to hedge the market risk in its variable annuity products” and measures embedded derivatives on funds withheld arrangements—to mitigate interest-rate, credit-spread and equity-market risks. The firm further demonstrates operational flexibility by modifying its segment reporting “to reflect how management evaluates the insurance business,” thereby enhancing transparency in resource allocation and strategic decision making. Collectively, these actions reflect KKR’s systemic perspective and dynamic capabilities in absorbing strain, preserving performance and adapting to internal or external disturbances.

AbbVie’s Management Discussion & Analysis describes a range of strategic initiatives and operational practices that collectively support the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions and preserve performance in the face of internal and external disturbances. The company seeks to maximize the benefits of a diversified revenue base with multiple long-term growth drivers, leverages its global commercial strength and international infrastructure to ensure strong commercial execution and business continuity, and commits substantial operating cash flows to support all stages of its pipeline assets, on-market brands, and innovative research and development while continuing to repay debt and return cash to shareholders. It anticipates achieving resilience through successful integration of acquisitions, effective management of regulatory, market and competitive challenges such as Humira biosimilar erosion and the Inflation Reduction Act, and operational flexibility provided by its amended five-year revolving credit facility and access to capital markets to issue or retire debt and commercial paper as needed. AbbVie continuously monitors economic conditions, customer creditworthiness, government regulations and evolving tax legislation, establishes allowances for credit losses and variable consideration, and utilizes factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk. The company updates actuarial assumptions for pension and post-employment benefits, assesses goodwill, indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur, and revalues contingent consideration liabilities to fair value as contingencies evolve. Loss contingencies for litigation and other risks are recorded at management’s best estimate and adjusted as information becomes known, reflecting AbbVie’s ability to absorb strain, reconfigure resources, preserve system integrity and maintain organizational functioning under both nominal and extreme conditions.

In 2023, against a backdrop of mixed demand, AMD launched multiple leadership products across its business and advanced its AI strategy by delivering a broad portfolio and multigenerational roadmap of leadership CPUs, GPUs and adaptive computing solutions designed for AI inference and training and by extending an open software platform to enable broad deployment and ease of use, while strengthening AI software capabilities through the acquisitions of Mipsology SAS and Nod, Inc. to develop the full AI software stack and accelerate ecosystem deployment. AMD introduced purpose-built architectures such as its 4th Gen EPYCTM 97x4 and 8004 series processors for cloud-native and mainstream computing, InstinctTM MI300X accelerators and MI300A APUs integrating CPU and GPU cores on a single package, the ROCmTM 6 open software platform, VersalTM VP1902 adaptive SoCs for streamlined verification of ASICs and SoC designs, SpartanTM UltraScale+ FPGAs for low-power, high-I/O applications, AlveoTM MA35D media accelerators for scalable interactive streaming, ZynqTM UltraScaleTM RFSoC devices to expand 4G/5G radio deployments, and adaptive system-on-modules such as KriaTM K24 SOM that offer small-form-factor, power-efficient compute for cost-sensitive edge applications. The company expanded its client and commercial portfolios with RyzenTM 7000 series mobile, Ryzen ProTM series mobile, Ryzen 7045HX3D and Ryzen X3D desktop processors featuring AMD 3D V-cache technology, and introduced RadeonTM RX and Radeon ProTM GPU series optimized for high-performance gaming and professional workflows, reflecting an agile approach to product innovation and customer needs. Despite a 4% decrease in net revenue to $22.7 billion, declines in client and gaming segments were partially offset by a 17% increase in embedded revenue driven by the full-period inclusion of Xilinx and a 7% increase in data center revenue from higher sales of Instinct GPUs and 4th Gen EPYC CPUs, underscoring segment diversification as a resilience mechanism. AMD maintained $5.8 billion of liquidity in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, a $3.0 billion revolving credit agreement, a $3.0 billion commercial paper program, and managed $4.6 billion of purchase commitments through ongoing supplier collaboration, providing operational flexibility and business continuity to support inventory builds for advanced process nodes and to fund capital expenditures and working capital needs. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion after adjustments, driven by net income and non-cash adjustments, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities such as accounts receivable and inventories, reflecting AMD’s adaptability in resource deployment. The company continues to plan for seasonal and market variability and expects its financial resources and access to capital markets to sustain ongoing operations. These initiatives and financial management measures reflect the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, underscoring AMD’s ability to absorb strain and preserve performance amid market and supply chain pressures.

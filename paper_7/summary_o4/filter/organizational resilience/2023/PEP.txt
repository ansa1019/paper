PepsiCo, as a global company with deep local ties, faced many of the same challenges in 2023 as consumers, customers and competitors worldwide, including supply chain disruptions; inflationary pressures; shifting consumer preferences and behaviors; ongoing climate issues; a highly competitive operating environment; a rapidly changing retail landscape, including growth in e-commerce; continued macroeconomic and political volatility, including the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East; and an evolving regulatory landscape. To meet the challenges of today—and those of tomorrow—the company is driven by Pep+ (PepsiCo Positive), a strategic end-to-end transformation of the business with sustainability at the center of how the company strives to create growth and value while inspiring positive change for the planet and people, as reflected in efforts to expand regenerative agricultural practices, open a biomethane plant to convert by-products into biogas, embed sustainability in new facilities and introduce circular and inclusive value-chain initiatives such as scaling reusable packaging offerings and direct-to-consumer models. The achievement of strategic and operating objectives involves risks, many of which evolve over time; to identify, assess, prioritize, address, manage, monitor and communicate these risks and foster a corporate culture of integrity and risk awareness, PepsiCo leverages an integrated risk management framework overseen by the board and its designated committees, supported by a cross-functional risk committee and a risk management office, with dedicated processes for assessing risks related to cybersecurity, food safety, sustainability, human capital management and supply chain inflation. The company continues to monitor existing and proposed laws and regulations, economic and political environments—including unstable conditions, civil unrest, debt and currency controls in certain jurisdictions—and changes in the retail landscape, seeking actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on future results; in parallel, it manages market risks through productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs, fixed-price contracts, purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments to hedge commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks, while offering voluntary supply chain finance arrangements that enable participating suppliers to leverage PepsiCo’s creditworthiness. These collective efforts illustrate the company’s multifaceted capacity to absorb strain, adapt to environmental disruptions and preserve or improve functioning and performance under pressure.

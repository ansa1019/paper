We continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses while managing overall operating costs and we also continue to invest in our network to support higher-speed broadband offerings and to expand the number of homes and businesses passed. We maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facility and our commercial paper program to meet our short-term liquidity requirements and believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing credit facility; and our ability to obtain future external financing. An increasingly competitive environment and continued low domestic household move levels have had negative impacts on our customer relationships additions/(losses), which we aim to mitigate by believing our residential connectivity revenue will increase as a result of growth in average domestic broadband revenue per customer, as well as increases in domestic wireless and international connectivity revenue. At the same time, we expect continued declines in video revenue as a result of domestic customer net losses due to shifting video consumption patterns and the competitive environment, although customer net losses typically mitigate the impact of continued rate increases on programming expenses, and we also expect continued declines in other revenue related to declines in wireline voice revenue. We believe our business services connectivity segment will continue to grow by offering competitive services, including to medium-sized and enterprise customers. Global economic conditions and consumer sentiment have in the past, and may continue to, adversely impact demand for our products and services and our results of operations, leading us to use adjusted EBITDA and constant currency measures to monitor performance and allocate resources. We continue to invest significantly in existing and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, including Epic Universe in Orlando, as well as in new destinations and experiences, which we believe will have a positive impact on attendance and guest spending at our theme parks. We expect our capital expenditures in 2024 will continue to be focused on investments in line extensions for the expansion of both business services and residential passings in the connectivity & platforms business, in scalable infrastructure as we increase capacity and continue to execute our plans to upgrade our network to deliver multigigabit speeds, and in the continued deployment of wireless gateways. In connection with our impairment assessment process, we employ qualitative and quantitative analyses, including discounted cash flow models and comparable market multiples, to ensure the carrying values of our goodwill, cable franchise rights and capitalized content remain supportable under varying macroeconomic conditions and to preserve system integrity and performance.

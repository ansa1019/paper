While uncertainties remain in the economic and geopolitical environment, our 2023 results demonstrate the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, as we believe we are well positioned to organically grow revenues over the long term given cumulative rental growth and a high lease mark-to-market, supported by total available liquidity of $6.0 billion, borrowing capacity on credit facilities of $5.5 billion and unrestricted cash balances of $530 million. We have enhanced our operational flexibility and resource deployment by amending and restating our global senior credit facilities—increasing capacity to $3.0 billion and extending maturities to 2027—by amending our Japanese yen revolver and entering into Chinese renminbi term loans, and by issuing diversified senior notes across multiple tenors and currencies. We mitigate foreign currency and interest-rate risk through natural hedges by borrowing in investee currencies and through designated and undesignated derivative financial instruments that manage exchange rate exposures, thereby preserving system integrity and performance under external disturbances. We fund our capital needs—including development completions, build-to-suit starts, operating portfolio improvements and the addition of sustainable and efficient building features—through a combination of operating cash flows, distributions from unconsolidated co-investment ventures, contributions to and dispositions from ventures, proceeds from property contributions and sales, and available debt capacity, all while remaining in compliance with our financial covenants and maintaining investment-grade credit ratings. We monitor and adapt to weather-related and other external perturbations through increased insurance provisioning and cost allocations, and we work with our co-investment ventures to maintain sufficient liquidity and refinance maturing debt, recognizing that their ability to refinance on favorable terms is not assured, thus underscoring our strategic foresight and systemic perspective in preserving organizational resilience.

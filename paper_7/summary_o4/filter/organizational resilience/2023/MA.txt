Mastercard employs a multi-layered approach to help protect the global payments ecosystem in which it operates and allocates resources toward business continuity by maintaining existing liquidity, cash generated from operations and access to capital—through an $8 billion revolving credit facility and commercial paper program—to fund global operations, credit and settlement exposure, capital expenditures, technology investments and current and potential obligations, including settlement guarantees, while recognizing that liquidity and access to capital may be adversely affected by global credit market conditions or legal and regulatory outcomes. The Company’s investments in new networks, such as open banking solutions and digital identity capabilities, support and strengthen its payments and services solutions and enhance operational flexibility and systemic resilience, with each capability interdependent and governed by a franchise model that balances value and risk across stakeholders. To manage foreign currency variability and transactional and translational impacts on anticipated revenues and expenses, Mastercard may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments, and it establishes deferred taxes and valuation allowances based on projected taxable income, reversing temporary differences and ongoing tax planning strategies to preserve organizational health under varying conditions. In response to imposed sanctions and the suspension of its business operations in Russia, Mastercard recorded net pre-tax charges and corresponding net benefits related to reduced rebates and incentives liabilities, adjusting its key drivers and growth metrics to reconfigure its operational trajectories. The Company regularly reviews the status of significant litigation and claims, assessing potential financial exposure and accruing liabilities when losses are probable and estimable, and revises those estimates as additional information becomes available to mitigate risk and maintain performance. Mastercard uses non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics—such as gross dollar volume, cross-border volume and switched transactions growth—to evaluate trends, measure performance, prepare financial projections and make strategic decisions, thereby reinforcing its ability to anticipate, adapt and sustain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

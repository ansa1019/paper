In 2023, the company continued to ramp production, build new manufacturing capacity and expand operations to increase deliveries, deploy capital-intensive projects and integrate its supply chain vertically and locally, investing in research and development to accelerate artificial intelligence, software and fleet-based profit growth and improve vehicle and battery technologies while maintaining operational flexibility to adjust production rates, reduce costs and mitigate supply-chain disruptions; these initiatives faced uncertainties inherent in new product and manufacturing technologies, concurrent international projects, industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages, inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, interest rate fluctuations, regulatory and political volatility, and pre-planned factory shutdowns, prompting cost innovation strategies, localized procurement, manufacturing efficiency improvements, operating leverage enhancements and the ability to slow or accelerate capital expenditures by segment. Simultaneously, the company expanded its global service and charging infrastructure, optimized Supercharger locations in response to the adoption of standards by external partners and increased energy-storage and solar-roof installation capabilities while ensuring adequate battery-cell supply and qualified personnel. These activities were supported by sustained positive operating cash flows, disciplined working capital management with shorter days-sales-outstanding than days-payable-outstanding, prudent liquidity management including investments in U.S. government securities and other short-term investments, unused committed credit facilities and the flexibility to raise additional capital or repay indebtedness early. The companyâ€™s ability to self-fund its growth, continuously evaluate and adjust its capital and operating expenditures by business segment and maintain substantial cash, cash equivalents and investments underpins its capacity to absorb strain, preserve or improve its functioning and maintain performance when confronted with internal or external pressures, disturbances or adversity.

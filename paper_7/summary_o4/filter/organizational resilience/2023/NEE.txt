Management uses adjusted earnings—which exclude volatility from non-qualifying hedge fair value movements—for internal planning, performance analysis and incentive compensation, asserting that this measure offers a more meaningful representation of fundamental earnings power; FPL implemented an interim storm restoration charge in April 2023 and obtained regulatory approval to recover approximately $1.3 billion of hurricane-related costs while continuing significant investments in plant-in-service and property additions to maintain reliable service. NEE and its subsidiaries anticipate funding business support and growth through a combination of operating cash flows, short- and long-term borrowings, debt and equity issuances, sales of renewable energy tax credits and asset divestitures, consistent with a long-term capital structure designed to support a strong investment-grade credit rating and maintain operational liquidity. The company relies on access to credit and capital markets as critical liquidity sources and recognizes that inability to maintain current credit ratings or provide additional collateral under certain agreements could impair financing strategies and increase funding costs. To manage counterparty credit and market risk, subsidiaries employ master netting agreements, letters of credit, cash collateral and guarantees—quantifying mark-to-market exposures of approximately $1.8 billion for trading activities and monitoring credit exposures of $3.5 billion, of which 93 percent is investment grade. Pension benefits and nuclear decommissioning obligations are reviewed annually under actuarial assumptions (including discount rates, compensation growth and expected return on plan assets) and adjusted to ensure adequate funding, while asset retirement obligations for nuclear and generation assets incorporate projected escalation rates and timing of decommissioning activities. Long-lived assets and equity method investments are tested for recoverability and impaired, if necessary, based on undiscounted cash flow projections and fair value models, and regulatory assets and liabilities—reflecting probable future cost recoveries or refunds—are recorded in accordance with cost-based rate-making, subject to disallowance for imprudent costs. Commodity price, interest rate and equity price exposures are measured with value-at-risk models, discounted cash-flow valuations and sensitivity analyses, and managed through derivative contracts and hedges to mitigate volatility, thereby enabling the organization to absorb financial strain, reconfigure resources and preserve performance under challenging conditions.

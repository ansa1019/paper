In 2023, Boston Scientific confronted global supply-chain disruptions, inflationary pressures and geopolitical uncertainties affecting the availability and cost of raw materials, components and distribution, and in response approved and committed to a global restructuring program to optimize its manufacturing and distribution network by transferring production lines among facilities, simplifying operations, achieving cost synergies and driving operational efficiencies while redeploying resources to growth areas and new product launches; it also reorganized its operational structure into two core segments to enhance strategic agility and information flow, maintained robust liquidity through cash balances, commercial paper and an extended revolving credit facility to fund operations, capital investments and strategic acquisitions (including Apollo Endosurgery, Relievant Medsystems and Acotec Scientific, and a planned acquisition of Axonics) while managing financial covenant compliance, managed foreign currency risk through hedging and adjusted reporting to neutralize currency fluctuations, reserved for contingent consideration, litigation and tax exposures, invested in research and development to sustain its innovation pipeline, navigated regulatory changes such as the EU MDR with planned implementation costs, and advanced environmental and ESG initiativesâ€”all measures that demonstrate its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under internal and external pressures.

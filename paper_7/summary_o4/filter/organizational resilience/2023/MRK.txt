Merck’s management discussion discloses multiple strategic and operational initiatives that collectively underpin its organizational resilience, in line with the definition of “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” as the company demonstrates its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning amid external pressures. The company emphasizes disciplined capital allocation and execution of strategic business development transactions to augment its robust internal pipeline with compelling external science, while adapting to global health-care cost containment reforms and pricing pressures that are expected to negatively affect sales and profits. Multi-year restructuring programs—most recently the 2024 initiative to optimize its human health and animal health global manufacturing networks to improve supply reliability and efficiency (with approximately $4.0 billion in pretax charges and anticipated cumulative annual net cost savings of $750 million by 2031) and the substantially completed 2019 program to streamline its manufacturing and supply network and global real estate footprint—reflect resource reconfiguration, operational flexibility and risk mitigation in the face of evolving needs. Formal foreign currency, balance-sheet, net-investment and interest-rate hedging programs are employed to reduce volatility in earnings, cash flows and asset and liability values caused by fluctuations in exchange and interest rates, while a conservative financial profile—characterized by high-quality cash and investments, prudent debt management, detailed forecasting of working capital, tax and lease obligations, collaboration-related payments and purchase commitments, and reliance on strong operating cash flows supplemented by commercial paper and long-term borrowings as needed—ensures liquidity, business continuity and system resilience under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

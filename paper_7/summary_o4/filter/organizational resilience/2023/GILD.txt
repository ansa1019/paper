Gilead’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis describes a number of strategic and operational measures that support the company’s ability to absorb strain and maintain performance under internal and external pressures.  During 2023, Gilead continued to invest in its business and research and development pipeline through acquisitions and collaborations, including the acquisitions of Xinthera and Tmunity to add novel technology platforms and preclinical and clinical programs, as well as license agreements and equity investments in Assembly, Arcellx, Compugen, Arcus and others, demonstrating proactive resource reconfiguration and reallocation to support long-term growth.  The company manages research and development expenses by prioritizing activities based on scientific data, probability of technical and regulatory success, market potential and available human and capital resources, and regularly reviews and reallocates resources among internal R&D and external opportunities in response to emerging clinical data and competitive dynamics.  Gilead maintains operational flexibility and business continuity through continued investment in its pipeline while also providing shareholder returns via dividends and share repurchases and by issuing and repaying debt to optimize its capital structure.  To mitigate external pressures from foreign currency fluctuations, approximately 26 percent of product sales are hedged through foreign currency exchange contracts, and exposure is reassessed each period.  The company’s cash and cash equivalents increased to $8.4 billion as of December 31, 2023, and it believes these capital resources, together with its revolving credit facility and cash flows from operating activities of $8.0 billion, are adequate to meet foreseeable needs, illustrating resilience in liquidity management.  When clinical programs do not meet efficacy endpoints, as in the Phase 3 evokE-01 trodelvy study, Gilead analyzes numerical improvements, engages regulators and key opinion leaders to determine appropriate next steps, and initiates interim impairment assessments of related intangible assets to adjust carrying values, reflecting adaptive responses to disruptive events.  The impairment testing process uses a probability-weighted income approach that discounts expected future cash flows and considers uncertainties in regulatory approval, competitive environment, and development timelines, enabling timely recognition of potential impairment charges.  Gilead also employs a complex estimation process for gross-to-net deductions, regularly reassesses legal contingencies and tax positions—including the impact of Pillar Two global minimum tax legislation—and records accruals for settlements, such as the $525 million accrual for HIV antitrust litigation, all of which demonstrate continuous risk assessment, resource deployment and strategic adaptation to preserve organizational integrity and performance under challenging conditions.

The firm’s operations are supported by “data-driven risk advisory services and insurance solutions” and “advanced risk, reinsurance and capital strategies” that reflect a systemic perspective and risk mitigation approach to maintain performance under pressure; the “four businesses also collaborate together to deliver new solutions to help clients manage complex and interconnected risks,” illustrating inter-organizational collaboration and service innovation in the face of external pressures. In 2023, “results of operations were impacted by restructuring activities of $301 million, primarily related to severance and lease exit charges for activities focused on workforce actions, technology rationalization and reductions in real estate,” demonstrating adaptive resource reconfiguration and operational flexibility, with expected total charges of $475 million and related estimated savings of approximately $400 million, of which $230 million were realized in the year and the remainder anticipated by the end of 2024. Liquidity and capital resources are managed through a $3.5 billion multi-currency unsecured five-year revolving credit facility, senior note issuances and repayments, and a disciplined approach to repatriating and permanently reinvesting foreign earnings—$1.2 billion of which is maintained outside the U.S.—to ensure business continuity amid currency variability, macroeconomic and geopolitical disruptions, capital markets volatility and inflation. The company generated $4.3 billion of operating cash flows, uses non-GAAP underlying revenue measures to guide internal resource allocation decisions, and conducts regular “critical accounting estimates” reviews—including projections for revenue recognition, legal and loss contingencies, retirement benefits funding, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, goodwill impairment testing and fair value measurements—to anticipate, absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite evolving internal and external variations, thereby embedding resilience strategies into its organizational practices and strategic initiatives.

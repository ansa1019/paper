In fiscal 2023, revenues were negatively impacted by weakness in the macroeconomic environment and elevated customer inventory levels, prompting other expenses of $862 million primarily related to restructuring and restructuring-related charges resulting from cost reduction actions initiated to enable investments in key growth and diversification opportunities, while capital expenditures were reduced from $2.3 billion to $1.5 billion in response to weakening demand. We continue to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value considering future customer demand and market conditions, monitor our investments, goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment indicators based on financial position, industry performance and macroenvironmental trends, and record provisions for probable legal, regulatory and tax contingencies when amounts can be reasonably estimated. We believe it is important that we remain a leader in 5G technology development, standardization, intellectual property creation and licensing and a leading developer and supplier of 5G integrated circuit products in order to sustain and grow our business long term, and we continue to devote resources to education of industry participants and governments on the benefits of our licensing programs. Our liquidity strategy relies on existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, operating cash flows—which benefited from decreased accounts receivable, utilization of prior advanced supply agreement payments and settlement receipts—and debt programs to satisfy working and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. We expect to continue making strategic investments and acquisitions, manage trade and geopolitical risks, issue new debt as conditions warrant and adjust our cost structure and resource deployment to maintain operational flexibility under ongoing uncertainty.

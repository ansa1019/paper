Each of our segments is subject to variable industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips, display technologies and other electronic devices, as well as global economic, political and market conditions and the timing of technological advances in fabrication processes, imposing external pressures that require operational flexibility and adaptation. In light of these conditions, our results can vary significantly year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, and managing supply chain and logistics constraints to increase shipments to customers remains a top priority, reflecting our focus on preserving performance under supply disruptions. Our strategic priorities include developing products that help solve customersâ€™ challenges at technology inflections, expanding served market opportunities and growing our services business, supported by significant investments in research, development and engineering to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand and thereby maintain a competitive advantage. We work closely with our global customers to design systems and processes that meet their planned technical and production requirements, illustrating inter-organizational collaboration and anticipatory response strategies. Cash provided by operating activities, which reflects net income adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in working capital components, increased primarily due to better inventory management, improved accounts receivable collections and lower income tax payments, underscoring our resource allocation and liquidity management capabilities. We maintain credit facilities, a commercial paper program and senior unsecured notes to ensure financial flexibility and access to liquidity, and we monitor our investment portfolio for credit risk to manage financial resources prudently. Capital expenditures and investments in technology to access new market opportunities are prioritized to reconfigure resource deployment toward growth areas. We believe that cash generated from operations, together with liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months, demonstrating our capacity to absorb internal and external variations and preserve functioning under challenging conditions.

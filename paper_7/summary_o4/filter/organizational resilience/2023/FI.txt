Management indicates that it is effecting changes in its business designed to further enhance operational performance in the delivery of its integrated portfolio of products and solutions to its financial institution clients and, as a result, expects to realign its reportable segments to correspond with these organizational changes while continuing to allocate resources and assess performance based on the current structure. It frequently reviews its businesses to ensure it has the necessary assets to execute its strategy, acquiring businesses when it identifies a compelling strategic need to meet client demand, change industry dynamics or achieve operational scale, and divesting businesses that no longer align with its market, product or financial strategies. The Company’s liquidity needs for operating expenses, debt servicing and capital expenditures are expected to be satisfied through cash flow generated by operations, available cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from commercial paper issuance and capacity under revolving credit facilities, reflecting the system’s ability to maintain integrity under external pressures. Operating leverage and expense management initiatives have driven profitability improvements and higher operating cash flow, and management actively monitors and manages its business in response to unpredictable geopolitical, macroeconomic and supply chain conditions—such as rising interest rates, inflation, bank failures and foreign currency fluctuations—to mitigate risks, support business continuity and preserve operational flexibility. It notes that bank failures in early 2023 created uncertainty in global financial markets but did not have a material impact on operating results, demonstrating resilience under sudden disruptions, although future failures could affect receivable collections and cash flows or its ability to secure merchant alliance partners. The Company believes that its long-term focus on client relationships and recurring transaction-oriented products and services reduces the impact of industry consolidation, and that economies of scale in infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks are essential to justify its investments and support sustainable growth. Its risk management framework includes reviewing goodwill and intangible assets for impairment based on qualitative and quantitative factors, maintaining valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on the weight of available evidence, and ensuring compliance with debt covenants, thereby underpinning its capacity to adapt its strategic response and maintain performance under varying conditions.

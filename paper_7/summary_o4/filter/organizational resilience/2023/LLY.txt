Management continuously evaluates liquidity and capital resources, including available cash, cash equivalents, operating cash flow, and access to short- and long-term borrowings, to ensure sufficient funding for working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt repayment, business development activities, and benefit plan contributions, reflecting strategic foresight, resource allocation, and operational flexibility to preserve functioning under adverse conditions. We manage research and development spending across our portfolio of potential new medicines and indications, such that a delay or termination of an individual project does not necessarily cause significant change in total R&D spending, demonstrating adaptability, risk mitigation, and resource reconfiguration. We invest in external research and technologies through acquisitions, collaborations, investments, and licensing arrangements to complement and strengthen internal capabilities and pipeline resilience, accounting for acquired in-process research and development charges and goodwill assessment under uncertain outcomes. We have faced and expect to continue to face challenges meeting strong demand for incretin products, and in response have implemented actions to manage demand amid tight supply, progressed efforts to expand manufacturing capacity at internal sites and through contracted facilities globally, and plan significant capacity expansions in North Carolina, Indiana, Germany, and Ireland, underscoring our commitment to business continuity, operational continuity, and performance maintenance. We employ a controlled risk management program, including derivative financial instruments, to hedge exposure to interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations, aiming to limit the impact of market volatility on earnings and cash flows, which reflects our systemic perspective, crisis management, and resilience strategies. Our response to evolving pricing and reimbursement reforms, including the Inflation Reduction Act’s government price-setting and rebate requirements, involves adapting development approaches and at-risk investments, demonstrating strategic agility in the face of external pressures. We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of customers, supply chain complexities, international tensions, and market volatility, and our corporate risk-management policy specifies hedge coverage for foreign currency exposures to support system integrity and operational resources. Our capital expenditure program, which increased significantly in 2023, including investments in new facilities and capacity expansions, illustrates resource generation, strategic planning, and long-term orientation aimed at sustaining competitive advantage and maintaining performance under pressure. Management’s approach to acquisitions—assessing whether transactions meet the definition of a business or asset acquisition, determining fair values of intangible assets, allocating resources, and evaluating potential impairments—reflects rigorous risk assessment and capacity for reconfiguring organizational trajectories toward future objectives, embodying the maintenance of integrity and positive adjustment in challenging circumstances.

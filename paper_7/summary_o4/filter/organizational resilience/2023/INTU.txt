In our management’s discussion and analysis, we note that to remain competitive and continue to grow, we are investing significant resources in our product development, marketing, and sales capabilities and in our information technology infrastructure, privacy and security capabilities, including obtaining ISO 27001 certification for a portion of our systems, to mitigate risk and ensure operational continuity as we offer more online services. We recognize that our growth strategy depends upon our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, enter new markets, and drive broad adoption of our products and services in an increasingly dynamic, highly competitive environment shaped by digitization and shifting customer expectations. We implement additional security measures and collaborate with state and federal governments to share information regarding suspicious activity and further strengthen industry-wide anti-fraud measures. We have realigned and reconfigured our organizational structure through the acquisitions of Credit Karma and Rocket Science Group LLC (Mailchimp), the strategic movement of our Mint offering between segments, and the renaming of our ProConnect segment to ProTax to preserve coherence and focus on core strategic objectives. We also emphasize forward-looking statements highlighting uncertainties and risks associated with our third-party service providers, and we engage in critical accounting judgments and estimates—including revenue recognition, business combination valuations, and impairment assessments—that support our ability to absorb pressures, adapt to changing conditions, and maintain the integrity of our financial reporting and operational performance.

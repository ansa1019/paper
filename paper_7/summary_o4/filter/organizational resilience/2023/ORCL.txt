We provide enterprise products and services through flexible on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid deployment models, thereby affording customers choice and facilitating the combinations of applications, infrastructure and support that best suit their needs and help preserve continuity under varying operating conditions. We continue to invest in research and development and in our global cloud operations to increase capacity, expand our geographic footprint and improve performance, and we have introduced programs to enable customers to pivot and migrate workloads to the Oracle Cloud, all of which support our ability to absorb demand shocks and maintain service continuity. Our active acquisition program, including the Cerner transaction, and subsequent integration of complementary products, services and technologies into our three operating segments, reflects our strategy to reconfigure resource deployment and reconstitute our service portfolio under both nominal and extreme market conditions. We manage our hardware business through a distributed manufacturing and support network and mitigate global supply-chain constraints by maintaining diversified vendor relationships and strategically allocating inventory, while our services business draws on accumulated intellectual property, best practices and Oracleâ€™s ecosystem experience to sustain performance under external pressures. We have executed management-approved restructuring plans to improve cost structure and efficiencies, including workforce realignments and facility optimizations, balanced by investments in second-generation cloud infrastructure to ensure operational flexibility. To bolster our financial resilience, we maintain significant liquidity through cash, marketable securities and a revolving credit facility, use a disciplined approach to capital expenditures and acquisitions, and structure debt maturities and stock repurchases to preserve strategic agility and support long-term performance maintenance.

Management’s strategy to maximize long-term free cash flow per share growth is grounded in a business model built around four sustainable competitive advantages—a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology that provides lower costs and greater control of its supply chain, a broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products that offers more opportunity per customer, market channel reach that yields better insight and knowledge of customer needs, and diversity and longevity of products, markets and customer positions that reduce single-point dependency and extend returns on investments—with investments made to strengthen and leverage these advantages over time. The company exercises discipline in allocating capital across research and development projects, development of new capabilities, expansion of manufacturing capacity and acquisitions, while maintaining diligence in its pursuit of efficiencies. This discipline is supported by cash flow from operations of $6.42 billion in 2023, together with $8.58 billion of total cash and short-term investments, an undrawn variable-rate revolving credit facility and access to debt markets, which the company believes are sufficient to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividends, debt repayments and other business requirements for at least the next twelve months. Strategic inventory buildup and $5.07 billion of capital expenditures on semiconductor manufacturing equipment and facilities reflect long-term capacity planning to reinforce its manufacturing and technology foundation, and management monitors factory loadings to spread fixed costs over output and mitigate margin variability as production levels fluctuate.

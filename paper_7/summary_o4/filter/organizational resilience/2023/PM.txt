We have evolved our portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector and invested $12.5 billion since 2008 to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, building world-class scientific assessment capabilities in pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research and post-market studies. In November 2022, we acquired Swedish Match AB, a leader in oral nicotine delivery, creating a global smoke-free combination that brings together our IQOS heat-not-burn platform and Swedish Match’s ZYN nicotine pouch franchise, and in 2021 we acquired Vectura Group PLC and Fertin Pharma A/S to expand into wellness and healthcare, thereby reconstituting our organizational capabilities and accelerating our smoke-free ambitions. In January 2023, we reorganized our business into four geographical segments alongside continuing Swedish Match and wellness and healthcare segments and plan to integrate Swedish Match results into our existing regional structure in the first quarter of 2024, reflecting our ability to reconfigure trajectories and align resource deployment with strategic objectives. Our agreement with Altria Group, Inc. to end our U.S. commercial relationship for IQOS effective April 30, 2024, followed by full U.S. commercialization rights, demonstrates operational flexibility and strategic foresight. The February 2024 global settlement with British American Tobacco P.L.C. resolves all ongoing patent infringement litigation and rescinds exclusion orders, reducing legal risks and enabling continued product iteration. In response to the war in Ukraine, our main priority remains the safety and security of employees and their families while we continue commercial activities where safety allows, supply adult consumers from production centers outside Ukraine and via contract manufacturing, and announced a $30 million investment in a new production facility in Lviv with production expected to commence in the first quarter of 2024. In Russia, we continuously assess evolving regulatory constraints and international restrictions that could affect value realization upon divestment, reflecting ongoing risk assessment and strategic planning under external pressures. As a holding company, our principal sources of funds—dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries—support our financial resilience, while investments in research, marketing and administrative infrastructure underpin our capacity to adapt and maintain performance under varying conditions.

Over the period from 2020 through 2023, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic affected Abbott’s diversified health care businesses in various ways and, after mobilizing its teams across multiple fronts in 2020 and 2021, Abbott developed and launched multiple types of new diagnostic tests to detect COVID-19 under emergency use authorizations and CE marks. While demand for COVID-19 tests was volatile and significantly declined as the pandemic shifted to an endemic state, Abbott managed availability issues with services, raw materials and supplies without significant supply disruption, mitigated inflationary pressures on manufacturing inputs through price increases and gross margin improvement initiatives, and, despite surges and intermittent lockdown restrictions in key businesses, saw overall volume trends improve in cardiovascular, neuromodulation and routine diagnostic testing in 2022 and 2023. In response to the U.S. pediatric nutrition recall in 2022, Abbott stopped production, entered into a consent decree to resume operations, and took actions to mitigate supply shortfalls—including shipments from Ireland, prioritization of production at its Columbus facility, conversion of liquid lines to ready-to-feed products, increased powder production in Arizona and importation from Spain—leading to a recovery of market share and a return to a market-leading position by the fourth quarter of 2023. Abbott management approved restructuring plans in 2021, 2022 and 2023 to streamline operations, reduce costs and improve efficiencies across its medical devices, diagnostics, nutritional and established pharmaceutical businesses, recognizing employee severance, fixed asset impairment and inventory charges while continuing to pursue gross margin improvement and margin-enhancement initiatives. Abbott regularly analyzes historical rebate trends, supply chain and tax exposures, engages internal and external professionals to adjust reserves and minimize audit adjustments, and maintains readily available financial resources—including a revolving credit agreement supporting up to $5 billion of borrowings and cash flow from operations expected to exceed capital expenditures and dividends—to ensure financial flexibility and operational continuity. Strategic acquisitions such as Bigfoot Biomedical and Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. have added complementary technologies and connected solutions to address evolving customer needs, while 2024 focus areas include targeted investments in product development for sustainable growth across established pharmaceuticals, medical devices, nutritionals, laboratory diagnostics, molecular and rapid diagnostics and a research and development spend targeted at approximately 7 percent of total sales.

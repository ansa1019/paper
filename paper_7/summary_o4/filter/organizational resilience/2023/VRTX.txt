The Company’s resilience is evidenced by investments in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines and by diversifying its pipeline across multiple modalities, pursuing research in diverse areas to balance the risks inherent in product development and support future growth. Management closely monitors discovery, nonclinical and clinical programs, frequently evaluates product development in light of new scientific, business and commercial insights, and reallocates resources as new information emerges, resulting in rapid changes in focus and priorities to mitigate risk and maintain progress under uncertainty. The Company builds and maintains its supply chain and quality assurance resources through a global network of third parties and internal capabilities, adapting supply chains for new and existing formulations and scaling production as needed to ensure stability of supply under operational and market pressures. It actively manages reimbursement arrangements, forecasting payor mix, estimating and adjusting rebates, and negotiating with government and commercial payors to secure access and address constraints on revenues. The Company maintains substantial cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and undrawn credit facilities, and prepares forward-looking capital and liquidity forecasts to fund operations for at least the next twelve months and retain financial flexibility amid regulatory changes and market volatility. Commitments for collaboration, licensing, acquisition milestone and royalty payments, as well as facility and purchase obligations, are tracked and assessed against strategic objectives and resource requirements. The accounting framework incorporates frequent reassessment of estimates—such as revenue recognition adjustments, in-process research and development valuations, goodwill impairment analyses and contingent consideration fair-value measurements—to preserve financial reporting integrity and system performance under evolving conditions.

“Users continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, and we are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business,” reflecting ongoing adaptation to evolving digital behaviors and competitive pressures. “As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings to serve these changing needs,” and “as users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets continue to increase, and may require continued investments,” leading us to “invest heavily and develop localized versions of our products and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets.” We “continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to develop new, innovative offerings, improve our existing offerings, and rapidly and responsibly deploy AI across our businesses,” and “expect to increase, relative to 2023, our investment in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives.” In parallel, “acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, and build strong partnerships around strategic initiatives,” illustrating resource reconfiguration and inter-organizational collaboration. Acknowledging that “as these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited, and we may need to change our business practices to comply with evolving regulatory and legal matters,” we maintain a foreign exchange risk management program and record liabilities “when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.” Our workforce reduction and office space optimization efforts, including severance charges and accelerated rent and depreciation, demonstrate operational flexibility under internal constraints. We “expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, cash flows from operations and financing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for at least the next 12 months,” and we “regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital return to stockholders,” thereby ensuring liquidity and continuity of operations.

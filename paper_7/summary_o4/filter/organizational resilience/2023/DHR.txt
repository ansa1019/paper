Danaher reports that as a diversified global business its operations are exposed to a range of worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic, political and geopolitical factors, and that its geographic and industry diversity, together with the scope of its products and services, helps mitigate the impact of any single industry or country on its consolidated results. The company’s individual businesses continuously monitor key competitors and customers to gauge relative performance and future outlook, reflecting a systemic perspective and future orientation in decision-making. Management emphasizes that long-term growth and profitability depend on Danaher’s ability to expand in high-growth geographies and market segments, identify, consummate and integrate acquisitions and strategic partnerships, develop innovative and differentiated products and services, expand and enhance its sales force, reduce costs and improve operational efficiency and quality, and effectively address an increasingly regulated environment. To maintain responsiveness and efficiency under rapid technological change and evolving customer needs, Danaher is making significant investments—both organic and acquisitive—to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources, particularly in high-growth markets. The company addresses market risks arising from interest rates, currency exchange rates, equity and commodity price volatility and credit exposures through its normal operating and financing activities, including periodic use of derivative instruments, and relies on its broad-based business activities to reduce the impact of volatility in any particular area. Liquidity management is conducted with an emphasis on the company’s ability to generate cash flows to fund operating, investing and financing requirements, and management believes that operating cash flow, cash on hand and available credit facilities will support continued investments in existing businesses, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, debt service, dividends, restructuring activities and overall capital structure management on both a short- and long-term basis. Danaher’s use of U.S. and euro-denominated commercial paper programs, backstopped by a $5 billion revolving credit facility, provides operational flexibility to refinance short-term obligations subject to market conditions, even in the face of financial market disruptions such as those experienced in 2020. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company entered into government-funded agreements to expand manufacturing capacity and testing production capabilities, under which agencies such as BARDA finance facility expansions in chromatography, media and single-use consumables and diagnostics technologies, with associated grants and government assistance recorded as offsets to operating expenses and capital expenditures. Management recognizes and reserves for legal contingencies and contract settlement expenses that are known or probable and reasonably estimable, and it evaluates uncertain tax positions on a more-likely-than-not basis while establishing valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when realization is uncertain, demonstrating risk assessment and mitigation practices designed to preserve integrity and performance under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

Bank of America maintains a comprehensive risk management framework, approved annually by its board and the Enterprise Risk Committee, that integrates clear risk appetite statements with defined roles and accountability across three lines of defense—front‐line units, Global Risk Management and Corporate Audit—to ensure ongoing identification, measurement, monitoring and control of strategic, credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance and reputational risks.  The firm’s enterprise‐wide stress‐testing and capital scenario‐management processes, including regularly updated macroeconomic and liquidity stress analyses and contingency funding plans, enable the organization to project and prepare for potential capital, earnings and cash‐flow shortfalls under a range of adverse and extreme conditions, supporting its Single Point of Entry resolution strategy and preferred recovery options.  A centralized funding and liquidity management approach, underpinned by substantial global liquidity sources—cash, high‐quality unencumbered securities and secured borrowing capacity—allows the corporation to diversify funding across products, segments and geographies, rapidly access committed facilities such as Federal Home Loan Bank advances and Federal Reserve discount window borrowings, and suspend capital distributions or share repurchases as necessary to preserve financial flexibility.  Business continuity and operational resiliency are reinforced through formalized playbooks, scenario‐based contingencies and operational procedures that ensure continuity of critical functions, including 24/7 cyber operations and robust cybersecurity defenses, while dedicated model‐risk and compliance functions independently validate valuation, credit and operational models, assess performance and remediate control gaps.  Regular reviews of deposit dynamics, asset-liability compositions and derivative‐hedging positions within the banking book reduce vulnerability to interest‐rate and foreign‐exchange shocks, and the firm’s capital‐allocation methodology—employing risk‐adjusted capital models across credit, market, interest‐rate, business and operational domains—aligns each segment’s strategic initiatives with targeted returns and regulatory requirements.  Together, these integrated governance, planning and execution processes cultivate a culture of disciplined risk‐taking, strategic agility and adaptive resource deployment that underpins the corporation’s ability to absorb strain, preserve functionality and emerge stronger under challenging or unexpected conditions.

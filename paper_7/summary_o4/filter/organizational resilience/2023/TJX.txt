The companyâ€™s forward-looking statements are expressly based on information currently available and subject to the risks, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions described in its risk factors, with no obligation to update projections, reflecting a formal risk-mitigation stance under uncertain conditions. To ensure business continuity and preserve performance under market perturbations, the company maintains a liquidity framework funded by cash generated from operations, a $5.6 billion cash balance, and $1.5 billion of undrawn credit facilities, and routinely monitors debt financing markets to opportunistically repay, refinance or prepay long-term indebtedness while balancing capital expenditure needs. Inventory-related hedging instruments are used to mitigate the earnings impact of foreign currency fluctuations on merchandise purchases, with mark-to-market adjustments recognized in cost of sales and offset upon settlement, supporting stability in earnings under exchange-rate volatility. Operating cash flow rose by $2 billion in fiscal 2024, driven by higher net income, increased accruals for incentive compensation and effective inventory management, and underpins planned fiscal 2025 capital investments of approximately $2.0 billion to $2.1 billion in offices, distribution centers, information systems, store renovations and new stores. Assessment of excess cash flow, liquidity, economic and market conditions, business prospects and legal requirements guides the timing and amount of share repurchases and dividends, with $4.0 billion returned to shareholders in fiscal 2024 and a dividend increase planned. In response to prior Covid-related store closures, comparable store sales measures were realigned, classifications held constant and foreign currency translation effects removed to provide accurate operating performance metrics. The use of the retail method for inventory valuation, with defined markdown and shrinkage policies, along with supply-chain cost management, freight optimization and merchandise margin enhancements, demonstrates a systemic perspective and resource allocation strategy designed to absorb external pressures, maintain integrity and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions.

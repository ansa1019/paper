The report highlights multiple facets of the company’s capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning amid adversity: it identifies “macroeconomic environment uncertainty” — including “inflationary pressure, higher interest rates, instability in the global financial markets, significant disruptions in the commodities’ markets … labor shortages” — as potential threats to business continuity and notes that “supply chain constraints continued to show improvement as 2023 progressed,” while stating “we are actively engaged in activities to seek to mitigate the impact of any supply chain disruptions on our operations.” It acknowledges that “fluctuations in labor availability globally, including labor shortages and staff burnout and attrition, could … impact our ability to hire and retain personnel critical to our manufacturing, logistics, and commercial operations” and warns that “the loss of critical members of our team … could significantly harm our operations.” Financial resilience considerations include recognition that “our deposits exceed insured limits” and that “in the event of the failure of any of the financial institutions … there can be no assurance that we would be able to access uninsured funds in a timely manner or at all,” reflecting liquidity risk management. In discussing the COVID-19 pandemic, management observes that “resurgences of the outbreak … affected da vinci procedure volumes” but that “after each resurgence … procedure volumes recover,” while hospitals contend with “staffing shortages,” deferred procedures, and treatment backlogs. The company has deployed adaptive financing via “fixed-payment and usage-based operating lease arrangements” to “offer customers flexibility in how they acquire systems,” and has increased inventory “to address the growth in the business as well as to mitigate risks of disruption.” Looking ahead, management expects future system placements to be influenced by “supply chain risks; economic and geopolitical factors; inflationary pressures; high interest rates; hospital staffing shortages; … governmental tenders and authorizations; … competition,” demonstrating a systemic perspective on external pressures and the need for dynamic adaptation. Purchase commitments are structured with cancellation and rescheduling rights “based on our business needs prior to delivery,” underscoring contractual flexibility. Collectively, these disclosures reflect the company’s efforts to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptions to maintain performance, continuity, and organizational strength under challenging conditions.

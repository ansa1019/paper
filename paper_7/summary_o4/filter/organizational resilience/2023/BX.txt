“2023 was a volatile year for global markets, driven by historic movements in U.S. Treasury bond yields, geopolitical instability, including in the Middle East, and economic uncertainty; nevertheless, the U.S. economy continued to show resiliency in 2023, underpinned by a strong labor market,” and “moderating inflation and economic resiliency in the U.S. have led to an increase in investor confidence in recent months.” To safeguard business continuity and preserve performance under internal or external disturbances, Blackstone “has multiple sources of liquidity to meet our capital needs, including annual cash flows, accumulated earnings in our businesses, the proceeds from our issuances of senior notes, liquid investments we hold on our balance sheet and access to our committed revolving credit facility,” and on December 15, 2023, amended and restated its $4.325 billion revolving credit facility to increase available borrowings and extend its maturity to December 15, 2028. The firm “targets operating expense levels such that total management and advisory fees exceed total operating expenses each period,” manages general partner and co-investment commitments with stress testing for scenarios of limited realizations and substantial capital calls, and may “use leverage opportunistically” to optimize its capital structure. Performance and resource deployment are monitored via “key operating metrics” such as fee-earning and total assets under management, distributable earnings and adjusted EBITDA, providing a systemic perspective on productivity, adaptability and the capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning under challenging conditions. Rigorous risk management practices—including transition planning for benchmark reform, ongoing evaluation of tax receivable agreement obligations and valuation methodologies subject to multiple levels of review—support informed decision-making, strategic response and operational flexibility, thereby reinforcing Blackstone’s ability to adjust positively under pressure and maintain integrity and performance across market cycles.

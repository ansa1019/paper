Schwab’s annual report discloses a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework that embeds risk identification and assessment, risk response, risk measurement and monitoring, and risk reporting and escalation into its corporate culture and governance, with oversight by the board risk committee, the global risk committee and functional sub-committees covering operational, compliance, financial, and new-product risks. The company emphasizes the integrity and resilience of its critical business functions and technology systems by maintaining geographically dispersed backup and recovery facilities, routinely testing business continuity and disaster-recovery plans, and operating a formal incident-management program to minimize interruptions. To ensure operational flexibility under market or firm-specific stress, Schwab conducts regular liquidity stress tests, monitors early-warning indicators, maintains a buffer of high-quality liquid assets, and diversifies funding sources through client deposits, FHLB borrowings, brokered certificates of deposit, repurchase agreements, unsecured and secured credit lines, and Federal Reserve facilities. In parallel, it performs net interest revenue and economic value of equity simulations—incorporating deposit-beta assumptions, prepayment modeling and interest-rate swaps—to quantify the impact of parallel and non-parallel rate shifts, and separately models bank deposit account fee revenue sensitivities. The firm also conducts capital stress testing under adverse macroeconomic and firm-specific scenarios, maintains internal capital targets above regulatory minima, executes a capital contingency plan for low-probability high-impact events, and monitors both the liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio to comply with regulation. Organizational adaptability is further demonstrated through the integration of $1.6 trillion of TD Ameritrade client assets across multiple transition groups, ongoing efforts to realize cost synergies and streamline operations via restructuring and real estate reductions, and the ability to sweep certain client deposits off-balance sheet under the 2023 IDA agreement, all of which preserve the company’s capacity to absorb strain and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

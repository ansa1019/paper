ServiceNow’s management highlights that the transformation to digital operations, enabled by the Now Platform, increases its customers’ resiliency and security and delivers additional value across enterprises. The company is closely monitoring unfolding geopolitical events—including the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the conflict in Israel and Gaza—and acknowledges that, while it does not presently anticipate a material impact on operations, continued or worsened disruptions could materially affect its business and results of operations. To mitigate external pressures such as rising interest rates, global inflation and bank failures, ServiceNow distributes its cash and cash equivalents across several large financial institutions, enforces policy restrictions on available-for-sale debt securities, maintains its non-marketable equity investments without material exposure to any single institution and enters into foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities. With subscription arrangements typically spanning three years and a renewal rate of 98% for the past three years, the company has generated positive operating cash flows for more than ten years, held $8.1 billion of cash and investments as of December 31, 2023, and anticipates that these resources—together with its non-cancellable purchase commitments, lease obligations and access to potential equity or debt financings—will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months. To support ongoing business continuity and adaptation to evolving regulatory and customer requirements, ServiceNow continues to invest in expanding its data centers, enabling its workforce and pursuing strategic acquisitions, and it uses non-GAAP measures such as free cash flow to provide investors with supplemental insight into the strength and performance of its operations under challenging conditions.

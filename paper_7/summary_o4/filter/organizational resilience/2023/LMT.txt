Lockheed Martin describes its operations within a complex and evolving global security environment, emphasizing a strategy to design and develop platforms and systems that meet current and future requirements for 21st century security and to integrate new and existing systems with advanced open-architecture networking and operational technologies to make defense forces more agile, adaptive and unpredictable, reflecting a systemic perspective on resilience. Key to enabling this strategy is the development of differentiating technologies, the forging of strategic partnerships and joint technology efforts, execution of a multi-year business transformation initiative to enhance digital infrastructure, increase efficiencies, foster collaboration across the business and maintain fiscal discipline, demonstrating resource reconfiguration and operational flexibility. The company actively manages funding uncertainties—expecting key programs to continue under continuing resolutions while acknowledging risks of delays in new awards—and works to minimize the impact of industry-wide supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures through cost management, efficiency improvements and contingency planning, embodying risk mitigation and adaptive strategies. Lockheed Martin continuously evaluates its portfolio through independent research and development, strategic acquisitions, divestitures and internal realignment activities to strengthen its products and services, and invests substantially in its people to ensure the workforce has the technical skills necessary to address rapidly evolving mission requirements, highlighting human capital, knowledge management and dynamic capabilities. Its balanced cash deployment strategy, encompassing capital expenditures on mission-critical technologies, disciplined use of credit markets, active debt and pension liability management, and pension risk transfer transactions, is intended to secure sufficient liquidity for operational continuity, future opportunities and stockholder returns, illustrating financial resilience. The company also monitors and evaluates environmental remediation obligations and regulatory recoveries, and identifies and monitors risks to technical, schedule and cost aspects of its long-term contracts—practices that collectively support its ability to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions consistent with the maintenance of positive adjustment and organizational resilience.

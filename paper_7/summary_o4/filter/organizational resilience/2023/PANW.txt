Our management’s discussion and analysis contains forward‐looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, underscoring our ongoing risk assessment and contingency planning to preserve operational continuity and system integrity under evolving pressures, including supply chain disruption and inflationary costs. We empower enterprises to absorb strain and maintain functionality through comprehensive zero trust cybersecurity platforms and services designed to secure network, cloud and endpoint environments, reduce total cost of ownership by improving operational efficiency and eliminating siloed point products, and enable centralized management irrespective of form factor, location or scale. We monitor key financial metrics—deferred revenue, billings, cash flow provided by operating activities and free cash flow—to evaluate our resilience by enhancing visibility into cash needs, supporting proactive resource allocation and stress testing across nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions. Our strategic initiatives—ongoing investment in innovation, introduction of new product and security modules, targeted acquisitions to advance our platform approach, expansion of information technology and financial infrastructure, and scaling of sales, marketing and administrative systems—reinforce our adaptive capacity to reconfigure trajectories of response toward disruptive events and sustain growth. We outsource manufacturing based on demand forecasts and accrue for purchase commitments to mitigate supplier and component risks, maintain a revolving credit facility tied to sustainability goals and manage lease and purchase commitments to preserve liquidity. Our incident response, risk management and threat‐informed consulting services further strengthen crisis preparedness, rapid recovery and organizational learning, while our belief that our cash flow from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet anticipated needs for at least the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future reflects our commitment to the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

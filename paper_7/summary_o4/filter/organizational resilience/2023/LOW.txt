The company’s perpetual productivity improvement initiatives allowed flexibility to control costs and respond to changes in demand, and its omnichannel investments enabled improved technology capabilities across stores and an enhanced customer experience, reflecting strategic adaptations to persistent macroeconomic pressures and uncertain DIY demand while maintaining a balanced focus on profitability. Inventory management practices, including replenishment aligned with sales trends and optimized timing of the spring product build, supported continuity of operations and partial maintenance of performance under adverse conditions. The company continued to generate substantial liquidity from operating activities ($8.1 billion), maintained $921 million in cash and cash equivalents alongside $4.0 billion of undrawn revolving credit capacity, and retained access to short‐ and long‐term capital markets, enabling resource deployment to fund operations, strategic investments for long-term growth, and shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases, without covenants that would trigger early settlement in the event of rating downgrades. Capital expenditures of $2.0 billion were directed toward strategic initiatives to serve customers, improve existing stores, and support expansion, demonstrating resource allocation and future orientation. Self-insurance arrangements with excess coverage limits and actuarial reserve practices for workers’ compensation, general liability, and extended protection plans provided risk mitigation to limit earnings volatility. Long-lived asset impairment assessments, conducted at the individual location and business unit levels with income and market approaches, ensured timely recognition of value adjustments in response to triggering events, thereby preserving organizational integrity and facilitating adaptation to structural changes.

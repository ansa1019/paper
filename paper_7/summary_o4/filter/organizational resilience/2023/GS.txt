Management emphasizes its ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions through a business continuity program “that is comprehensive, consistent on a firmwide basis, and up-to-date” to ensure that “critical functions can continue to operate in the event of a disruption,” supported by a contingency funding plan providing “a framework for analyzing and responding to a liquidity crisis situation or periods of market stress” that outlines mitigants to address cash and collateral outflows; an enterprise risk management framework “to identify, assess, monitor and manage the risks” of inadequate or failed processes, people, systems or external events across market, credit, operational and liquidity risk; and a three-lines-of-defense governance structure with independent risk oversight to manage evolving threats, including cybersecurity risk defined as the risk of compromising “the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our data and systems,” with preventive and detective controls to mitigate unauthorized access or disruption; liquidity risk management policies designed to “maintain a sufficiently liquid balance sheet” through dynamic balance sheet planning, limits, monitoring and scenario analyses, and a portfolio of unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash to cover potential outflows; capital management and stress-testing processes to ensure the “appropriate level and composition of capital in both business-as-usual and stressed conditions,” including internal and regulatory stress tests and contingency capital plans to absorb losses and maintain integrity; and operational risk management standards “to provide a well-controlled environment to minimize operational risks,” all of which collectively support the firm’s resilience, adaptability and ability to foresee, confront and benefit from disruptive change.

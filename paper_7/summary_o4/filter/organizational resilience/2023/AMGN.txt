Given the unpredictable nature of future virus surges, we continuously monitor the possible impacts of health-related events, work to mitigate effects on future study enrollment in our clinical trials and support our active sites in providing patient care and investigational drug supply. Our strategy includes integrated activities intended to strengthen our competitive position in the industry, which we pursue while maintaining a strategic and disciplined approach to capital allocation—supporting investment in our business, including the Horizon acquisition, and returning capital to shareholders through dividends. Amgen’s approach to and investment in human capital resource management is directed at attracting, motivating, developing and retaining talent to tackle enterprise-wide challenges; our compensation, benefits and development programs encourage performance, promote accountability and adherence to company values, align with shareholder interests and foster a diverse and inclusive culture that supports innovation. We have a long-standing ambition to be environmentally responsible, regularly setting and achieving targets for sustainability while growing revenues, increasing production capacity and expanding globally, and in January 2021 announced long-term environmental targets to achieve by 2027—including carbon neutrality, a 40% reduction in water consumption and a 75% reduction in waste disposed—financed in part through green bonds. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to maintain safety of principal, prudent liquidity and acceptable risk by limiting investments to debt and money-market instruments with primarily investment-grade credit ratings and by imposing restrictions on maturities and concentration. Consistent with optimizing our capital structure, we deploy accumulated cash strategically across internal and external innovation investments, capital expenditures, debt reduction, dividends and stock repurchases, reflecting our confidence in future cash flows. While not designed to completely address foreign-currency changes, our hedging activities seek to offset effects on net income by hedging net foreign currency exposure—primarily on euro-denominated sales—and we use interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges and cross-currency swaps to manage both interest rate and currency risks. We manage purchase obligations related to R&D commitments, capital expenditures and open purchase orders, with most payments expected within one year and contingent milestone payments managed through our operational budgeting processes. Our impairment review process encompasses property, plant and equipment and both finite- and indefinite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate potential unrecoverability, comparing undiscounted future cash flows or fair values to carrying amounts and recording impairment charges when necessary. We analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly, adjusting them based on trends and actual results, and monitor wholesaler inventory levels to maintain appropriate levels relative to end-user demand, supporting consistent revenue recognition. Cash provided by operating activities remains our primary recurring source of funds and is expected to continue supporting working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and strategic initiatives, and we believe existing funds and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs. We record and update accruals for loss contingencies—such as legal proceedings, government investigations and other matters—each quarter when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and can be reasonably estimated. Under the 2017 tax act, we elected to pay the repatriation tax in eight annual installments, reflecting our management of tax liabilities. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make subjective and complex estimates and assumptions that may be revised as new information emerges and could materially affect reported amounts.

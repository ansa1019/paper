We believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to changing economic and competitive conditions, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items and expanding online offerings; the impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases, including working with suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases, earlier-than-usual purchasing in greater volumes, and selectively passing cost increases on to our members; our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases, all of which reflect our operational flexibility under pressure; we also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses, and while available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure and initial operating profitability is lower with potential cannibalization, the negative aspects of such growth have continued to decline in significance relative to total operations; the membership format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue, and the extent to which we grow our membership base, increase penetration of executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability; our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs—even as certain costs such as health care and utilities remain partially outside our control—and we maintain employee compensation levels above industry averages to reduce turnover and enhance satisfaction, strengthening organizational health; management believes that our cash and investment position and operating cash flows, with capacity under existing and available credit agreements and bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future; material contractual obligations, including purchase obligations for merchandise, equipment, and third-party services and construction and land-purchase obligations for new and relocated warehouses, are managed to support business continuity; we maintain letters of credit and intend to renew bank credit facilities to preserve borrowing capacity; and our claims for employee health-care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance, supplemented by insurance coverage and reinsurance programs via a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary, reflecting our risk-mitigation mechanisms and capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adverse conditions.

During fiscal 2023, Micron navigated a sharply deteriorating memory and storage market characterized by weak demand, customer inventory reductions, and macroeconomic pressures by strategically adjusting its resources and operations to preserve performance. The company recognized $1.83 billion in inventory write-downs to align cost of goods sold with net realizable values, reduced capital expenditures, significantly curtailed wafer starts, and absorbed $382 million in facility underutilization charges to manage inventory levels and supply discipline, while instituting a workforce reduction approaching 15 percent under its 2023 restructuring plan, suspending bonuses, trimming discretionary spending, and lowering executive salaries to achieve an estimated $130 million in quarterly cost savings. In response to a cybersecurity review by China’s Cyberspace Administration, which restricts sales to critical infrastructure operators, Micron is working to mitigate revenue variability and aims to retain its global DRAM and NAND market share. To reinforce its long-term resilience, the company restructured its portfolio by discontinuing 3D XPoint development and monetizing its Lehi, Utah facility, repositioned investments toward leading-edge memory technologies, and advanced plans for two Chips Act–contingent DRAM fabs in Boise, Idaho and Clay, New York, as well as enhancements to its global back-end assembly and test network in Xi’an, China, and Gujarat, India. Liquidity management remains a priority, with over $10 billion in cash and investments, a $2.5 billion undrawn revolving credit facility, and diversified financing and government incentives expected to support ongoing capital expenditures, operations, and market variability for the foreseeable future.

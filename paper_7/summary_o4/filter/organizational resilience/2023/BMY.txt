Our principal strategy is to combine the resources, scale and capability of a large pharmaceutical company with the speed, agility and focus on innovation typically found in the biotech industry; as we undergo a period of renewal, we remain committed to driving near-term growth, minimizing transition risks and delivering sustainable long-term performance by enhancing productivity and efficiency, advancing our pipeline and executing disciplined business development. We regularly assess working capital needs, leverage ratios, debt maturities, capital expenditures and potential share repurchases, believing that existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities, together with cash generated from operations and flexible financing arrangements, will satisfy our multiyear cash requirements and maintain operational continuity. The evolution of our operating model, which focuses on disciplined marketing, selling and administrative expense management, together with a robust non-GAAP financial framework, enables strategic, financial and operational flexibility to invest in high-priority opportunities. We continue to expand our manufacturing capacity—such as the FDA approval of our Devens CAR-T facility—and optimize supply chain resilience through a company-wide policy and governance process governing direct-customer sales and inventory levels, monitored via DSAs that provide weekly wholesaler inventory and out-movement data, ensuring timely escalation and compliance under our SEC consent order. We mitigate risks from external pressures, including government pricing controls, tax and importation laws, and generic erosion, by proactively evaluating legislative impacts—such as the IRA and OECD minimum tax framework—and adapting our portfolio through diversified product approvals, targeted acquisitions of Mirati, Karuna and RayzeBio, strategic collaborations and disciplined capital allocation. Through expanding our pipeline of registrational assets, exploring innovative technologies like dual-targeting and allogeneic CAR-Ts, and leveraging differentiated research platforms, we reinforce our ability to absorb strain, preserve performance and transform in response to dynamic market and regulatory environments.

The company has instituted a range of initiatives and resource deployments designed to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under adverse conditions, including a revamped safety program centered on enhanced training, culture and team communication, an analysis of historical injury data to enforce a small number of critical operating rules, and refinement of proprietary “precision train builder” software to simulate in-train forces and enable proactive intervention by its operating practices command center to prevent derailments; it has supplemented these efforts with additional hot wheel bearing wayside detectors, real-time railcar condition monitoring, first responder training, hazard identification and risk assessments, and targeted capital investments to reduce variability and mitigate risk. To maintain network fluidity and operational flexibility amid weather disruptions, labor absences and evolving service demands, the company deployed additional locomotives, aggressively hired train, engine and yard employees to backfill attrition and cover critical absences, continuously monitored key operating metrics such as freight car velocity and locomotive productivity, and sequentially improved many operating measures through effective and productive use of resources. In its service and operational excellence initiatives, the company engages customers to align on specific needs and outcomes, uses data to measure itself against prior best performance, and reconfigures its network and asset utilization to respond to ever-changing environment and demand shifts. Liquidity and capital resource planning incorporates analyses of a wide range of economic scenarios and stress events to ensure sufficient borrowing capacity, working capital management and access to credit facilities, commercial paper and capital markets, thereby underpinning business continuity even under sustained lower volumes. The 2024 capital plan includes growth-related projects to drive carload increases, infrastructure hardening to improve network resiliency, fleet modernization for reliability and fuel efficiency, and projects aimed at operational efficiency and service innovation. Climate scenario analyses inform understanding of climate-related risks and opportunities, and the company pursues renewable fuels, low- and zero-emissions propulsion technologies and operational fluidity improvements to enhance system resilience. Critical accounting estimates for personal injury and environmental remediation liabilities, together with forward-looking statements addressing public health crises, geopolitical conflicts and macroeconomic uncertainties, reflect an overarching systemic perspective and strategic foresight focused on maintaining integrity and performance, at least partially, while under internal or external variations and disturbances.

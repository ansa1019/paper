The company’s management reports that it generated $21.2 billion of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2023, which, together with cash on hand and access to its $5.0 billion commercial paper program and back-up credit facilities, was used not only to meet operating requirements, debt service and contractual obligations but also to fund $8.4 billion in dividends, $8.0 billion in share repurchases, $3.2 billion in capital expenditures and $1.5 billion in acquisitions—actions that collectively serve to maintain business continuity, allocate resources strategically, and enhance operational flexibility under evolving economic conditions. The company’s disciplined capital-allocation approach, which prioritizes reinvestment in the business, followed by shareholder distributions and opportunistic debt management, is intended to support ongoing store growth, technology deployment and customer-experience improvements while retaining the ability to adjust spending in response to external pressures. At January 28, 2024, the company held $3.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, with access to long-term debt markets and alternative financing sources, including senior note issuances and covenant-light indentures, ensuring sufficient liquidity to absorb variations in working capital and unforeseen disruptions. Operating and finance leases are employed to secure real estate capacity for stores, distribution centers and support facilities, providing scalable infrastructure under nominal and extreme conditions. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $6.6 billion year-over-year, primarily through lower inventory purchases, vendor-payment timing and normalized inventory levels achieved by aligning purchasing with demand and selling through existing stock, reflecting the company’s ability to preserve or improve functioning despite market volatility and supply-chain fluctuations.

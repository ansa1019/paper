The company’s management regularly evaluates and adjusts its critical accounting policies, assumptions and estimates based on historical experience and a range of factors deemed reasonable under prevailing conditions and discusses these judgments with the audit committee to preserve financial integrity. It continuously monitors the direct and indirect impacts of macroeconomic pressures—including inflationary trends, interest-rate movements, foreign currency exchange fluctuations and geopolitical developments—on its business and financial results and mitigates currency risks in part through a cash flow hedging program. Its subscription-based business model, which recognizes revenue ratably over the term of customer agreements, delivers recurring and predictable revenue streams that support long-term growth initiatives and enable sustained investment in research and development, product innovation and strategic acquisitions. The company maintains substantial liquidity and operational flexibility through cash and short-term investment balances managed by professional firms, an undrawn $1.5 billion revolving credit facility (expandable to $2 billion), a $3 billion commercial paper program, senior unsecured notes and non-cancellable purchase obligations for hosting and data center services, ensuring it can absorb financial strain and reconfigure its capital structure as needed. It records valuation allowances and reserves for income tax and litigation exposures, regularly reassessing the likelihood of outcomes to address potential liabilities. Stock repurchase programs—executed via open-market and accelerated or structured repurchase agreements—are designed to return value to stockholders while minimizing dilution. Long-lived operating leases for facilities and data centers, indemnification arrangements for intellectual property claims and contingency planning further reinforce business continuity. Together, these measures enable the company to preserve or improve its functioning under internal and external variations and disturbances, adapt to environmental disruptions, maintain system integrity and performance, and position itself to emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

The companyâ€™s discussion of asset impairment and exit costs illustrates its capacity to absorb strain and reconfigure operations under adverse conditions: in 2014 it recorded pre-tax charges of $535 million ( $409 million after tax) primarily related to factory closures in the Netherlands, Australia and Canada and the restructuring of its U.S. leaf purchasing model, and in 2013 it recorded $309 million ( $202 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to the termination of distribution agreements in Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa and Asia and the restructuring of global and regional functions. Consultations with employee representatives and the implementation of social plans for factory discontinuation reflect measures taken to preserve organizational health and continuity. The defined use of adjusted diluted EPS to isolate core earnings from asset impairment, discrete tax items and unusual events supports comparability and informed decision making under disruptive events, demonstrating internal mechanisms for risk mitigation and performance maintenance. Forecasted incremental spending on reduced-risk products, skewed toward the second half of 2015 to support national expansion in Japan and Italy and pilot launches in additional markets, exemplifies strategic resource deployment and future orientation aimed at preserving performance amid currency fluctuations, tax law changes and varied market conditions. The identification of dividends and debt repayments from subsidiaries as principal sources of funds, together with the absence of restrictions on subsidiary cash distributions, underscores financial flexibility and operational continuity. By excluding future acquisitions, unanticipated impairment and exit charges, exchange-rate movements and unusual events from its 2015 guidance, the company demonstrates proactive risk assessment and strategic foresight to maintain integrity and performance in the face of internal and external pressures.

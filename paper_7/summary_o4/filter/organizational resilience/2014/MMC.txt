In its management’s discussion and analysis, the company underscores its ability to absorb strain and preserve performance through a diversified global platform offering risk management activities (“risk advice, risk transfer and risk control and mitigation solutions”) and consulting services, supported by disciplined resource allocation and capital management—including $2.1 billion of cash generated from operations in 2014, a $1.2 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility, and $1.3 billion of foreign cash permanently invested to fund working capital and regulatory requirements—and by proactive initiatives to reinforce system integrity, such as the early extinguishment of debt, $800 million of share repurchases, and strategic investments in acquisitions to expand capabilities and geographies. The company details adaptive pension funding measures—contributions of $25 million to U.S. and $156 million to non-U.S. plans; amendment and curtailment of U.K. defined benefit plans effective August 1, 2014, yielding a $65 million gain; ongoing monitoring of actuarial losses arising from discount rate fluctuations; and projected increases in pension expense based on actual asset returns of 9.8% and 19.4% in the U.S. and U.K.—to manage long-term obligations and maintain operational continuity. It also describes corporate transformation efforts, including strengthening cyber security protections and finance and HR optimization, rigorous quarterly reviews of legal and other loss contingencies through case-level and actuarial analyses, annual goodwill impairment testing (concluding no impairment in 2014), segregated fiduciary funds, and tax planning and unrecognized tax benefit strategies to sustain resilience under external pressures, all of which serve to support performance maintenance, crisis preparedness and reconfiguration toward future growth.

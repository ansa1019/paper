The Company has consistently reconfigured its resource deployment and operational processes to preserve and improve performance under varying internal and external pressures, as evidenced by its dynamic allocation of cash and personnel to support service innovation and international expansion.  It utilizes both its own and third-party content delivery networks to efficiently stream high volumes of content, thereby maintaining business continuity and operational flexibility as member demand grows.  Marketing and content investments are scaled in line with the timing and number of new territory launches, reflecting a systemic perspective on risk mitigation and agility in adapting to market fragmentation.  Technology and development expenses, which increased 25 % of revenues in 2014, include personnel-related costs for a 12 % growth in headcount supporting service improvements and international rollout, demonstrating internal knowledge integration and capability building.  Content acquisition and licensing commitments involve significant upfront cash payments relative to expense, giving rise to contractual obligations that the Company manages to absorb strain from multi-year programming deals and preserve system integrity under exceptional conditions.  The Company measures free cash flow—which was $393.5 million lower than net income in 2014—by comparing cash provided by operating and investing activities against excess content payments over expense and non-cash compensation, ensuring sufficient liquidity for debt obligations, future investments, and resilience in turbulent capital markets.  To bolster financial resources and future orientation, the Company plans to obtain at least $1 billion in long-term debt in early 2015, leveraging favorable interest rates to sustain its capacity to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and emerge stronger from challenging situations.

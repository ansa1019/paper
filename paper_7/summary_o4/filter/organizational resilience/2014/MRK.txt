Merckâ€™s annual report describes how, during 2014, the company continued a multi-year initiative to sharpen its commercial and R&D focus, redesign its operating model and reduce its cost base while remaining focused on innovation, including approvals for new medicine and vaccine products and pipeline enhancement through acquisitions of Idenix and Oncoethix and a strategic collaboration with Bayer, illustrating an organizational capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under adversity. The ongoing portfolio assessment process, highlighted by divestitures of non-core assets, out-licensing or discontinuation of selected late-stage programs and the divestiture of its consumer care segment, represents intentional resource reconfiguration toward core growth drivers and resilience strategies. Global and merger restructuring programs involving workforce reductions, rationalization of facilities and supply-network improvements are expected to generate substantial annual net cost savings by 2015, supporting disciplined cost management and targeted resource allocation. Merck asserts that it continually evaluates, adapts and improves business practices to meet customer needs, navigate competitive, regulatory and pricing pressures, and respond to an evolving health care environment, thereby maintaining operational continuity and performance under pressure. To mitigate internal and external pressures, the company employs risk-management mechanisms including a comprehensive privacy and data protection program, currency-risk hedging of forecasted revenues, balance-sheet exposures and net investments using options, collars, forwards and designated debt, interest-rate swaps to align asset-liability sensitivity, and conservative cash-investment guidelines. With significant cash and investment balances, strong credit ratings and stable operational cash flows, Merck sustains its ability to fund R&D, pursue external alliances and acquisitions, support in-line products and return capital to shareholders, evidencing adaptability, resourcefulness and resilience in the face of market volatility and regulatory uncertainties.

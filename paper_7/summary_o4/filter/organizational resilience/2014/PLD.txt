Management highlights the strength of its balance sheet, platform scale and team capabilities as enduring competitive advantages that support positive adjustment under challenging conditions and the preservation of performance amid market variability. The Company’s strategy to grow revenue, net operating income and cash flows through rising market rents, evidenced by eight consecutive quarters of positive rent change on rollovers, reflects adaptability to external pressures and resource reconfiguration to capture increasing demand for logistics facilities. Value creation from development is pursued by maintaining control of a substantial land bank, enabling the firm to deploy resources toward high‐potential projects and realize fair value through development or land sales. Economies of scale in assets under management are leveraged to expand investments with minimal incremental overhead, demonstrating operational flexibility and resilience in managing fragmentation and complexity. Consolidation of co‐investment ventures and selective acquisitions, together with disciplined dispositions, underpin the Company’s capacity to reconstitute its portfolio and emerge stronger from financial and environmental perturbations. Liquidity and capital resources are managed through diversified cash sources—operating activities, property contributions and dispositions, credit facilities and equity issuance—while debt maturities are extended and interest costs mitigated via currency‐matched borrowing and derivative hedging. Rigorous risk management processes, including environmental reviews, ongoing debt covenant monitoring and alignment of reporting under new accounting standards, further reinforce the organization’s ability to absorb strain, preserve integrity and sustain operational continuity under a range of nominal to extreme conditions.

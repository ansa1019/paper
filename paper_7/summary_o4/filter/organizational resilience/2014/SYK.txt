In 2014 we maintained separate dedicated sales forces for each principal product line to provide focused expertise, collaborated with customers on internal innovation and augmented our portfolio through targeted acquisitions—$358 million for Small Bone Innovations, $184 million for Berchtold, $120 million for Patient Safety Technologies and other strategic bolt-ons—thereby reconfiguring resources to absorb strain and preserve functionality under competitive and operational pressures; we also established a European regional headquarters in the Netherlands to strengthen our brand in Europe, support global growth, deliver operational efficiencies and simplify the customer experience. Our capital allocation strategy prioritized organic sales growth at the high end of the medtech industry, disciplined share repurchases of $100 million, dividend payments of $462 million and $916 million of acquisitions, funded primarily by $1.8 billion of operating cash flow and supplemented by $1.2 billion of net proceeds from debt offerings and $1.3 billion of available credit, reflecting proactive liquidity management and business continuity planning. We deploy a global cash management strategy that considers liquidity, economic factors and tax implications, including a planned repatriation of $2.0 billion from outside the United States, and continuously monitor receivables—particularly in southern Europe—to assess credit risk and maintain adequate reserves. Currency exposures are mitigated through forward exchange contracts, with gains and losses recognized in earnings or equity based on hedge designation and effectiveness; we maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical experience and product life cycles and self-insure product liability claims while recording liabilities for legal and recall contingencies on a best-estimate or minimum probable-loss basis. Our accounting policies for acquisitions, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles employ income-based fair value estimates, qualitative and quantitative impairment testing and ongoing review of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions, ensuring rigorous assessment and reconfiguration of financial and operational resources to maintain integrity and performance amid internal or external disturbances.

PepsiCo’s management monitors a broad set of key indicators—including organizational health, innovation, productivity, execution and talent management—to evaluate performance and build the internal knowledge, capabilities and resource allocation needed to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning in volatile markets. Over the past several years, the company has pursued multi-year productivity and cost-competitiveness programs—accelerating investments in manufacturing automation, optimizing its global manufacturing footprint, re-engineering go-to-market systems, expanding shared services and simplifying organizational structures—to reconfigure trajectories of response toward disruptive events and maintain continuity of operations under challenging conditions. Its business strategies—strengthening geographic presence to navigate economic and political instability, broadening a nutritious product portfolio in response to evolving consumer needs, adapting to digital and e-commerce channels, and embracing sustainable practices across the supply chain—reflect a systemic perspective, future orientation and dynamic capabilities that support resilience by reconstituting resources, mitigating external pressures and creating competitive advantage. To identify, assess, prioritize, manage and communicate strategic, financial, operational, compliance, safety and reputational risks, PepsiCo leverages an integrated risk management framework with board oversight, a cross-functional corporate risk committee, division-level risk committees, a corporate risk management office, a corporate audit department and a compliance and ethics function. In addition, the company maintains diversified liquidity and capital resources—including disciplined free cash flow generation, multi-currency revolving credit facilities, commercial paper programs and long-term debt strategies—to ensure resourcefulness, operational flexibility and the ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and emerge stronger from extreme or exceptional conditions.

In 2014, we continued to demonstrate organizational resilience by focusing on investments in targeted financial assets, divesting selected non-core assets and reducing our real estate portfolio, while reinvesting the proceeds—after-tax gains of $160 million on the sale of McGraw Hill Construction and $589 million on the sale of McGraw-Hill Education—into selective acquisitions, technology projects, share repurchases and general corporate purposes to maintain continuity of operations and enhance strategic flexibility. As part of our transformation into McGraw Hill Financial, we undertook a comprehensive review of our accounting and reporting practices and reconfigured our internal service allocations—allocating shared operating services to segments based on usage—to preserve integrity and performance under new organizational structures. We streamlined infrastructure by selling our data center and corporate aircraft, recorded restructuring charges to align cost structures, and acquired complementary businesses such as Eclipse Energy Group and BRC Investor Services to strengthen our capabilities in key markets and absorb external pressures. Our liquidity and capital resources remained robust, with $2.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents—approximately 60% domestic and 40% held abroad—supplemented by a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility, enabling us to preserve operational continuity, absorb legal and regulatory settlements totaling $1.6 billion, and fund dividend payments, share repurchases of $1.6 billion, and strategic initiatives without compromising our ability to adapt to environmental disruptions. We manage performance under pressure by monitoring segment operating profit margins, which were impacted by legal settlements and increased restructuring charges yet partially offset by strong revenue growth, and we realign our strategic priorities—creating growth through customer-focused innovation and driving performance through productivity, risk management, and compliance—to ensure the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

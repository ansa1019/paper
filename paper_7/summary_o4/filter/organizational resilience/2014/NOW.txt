Managementâ€™s discussion highlights a range of strategic investments, operational processes and risk-mitigation measures that support our ability to absorb strain, maintain continuity and adapt under challenging conditions.  We continue to invest in the development of our services, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth and to leverage existing data center capacity, including data backup and disaster recovery services, to preserve performance under internal or external variations and disturbances.  We maintain a scaled pricing model and billing practices that support predictable cash flows, and we defer and recognize revenue and associated costs only when collectibility is reasonably assured, thereby managing financial risk and preserving system integrity.  Our expansion of data centers, lease commitments and headcount growth is funded by existing cash and cash equivalents, short- and long-term investments and the net proceeds from our convertible senior notes, with contingencies for additional equity or debt financing as needed to meet future resource demands.  We regularly evaluate foreign currency exposure and may hedge selected transactions to mitigate adverse market effects, while maintaining no off-balance sheet arrangements to limit financing, liquidity, market or credit risk.  A full valuation allowance on U.S. deferred tax assets and a rigorous assessment of uncertain tax positions further reflect our cautious management of financial resources.  We recognize incremental selling costs such as commissions and referral fees as deferred commissions, amortized over non-cancelable contract terms, aligning expense recognition with revenue generation and supporting operational flexibility.  Seasonal patterns in new and renewal customer agreements and deliberate adjustments to commission plans and average contract terms demonstrate our responsiveness to market cyclicality and our capacity to reconfigure sales trajectories in pursuit of growth.  These practices, together with forward-looking statements that acknowledge risks and uncertainties in our plans and strategy, underpin our systemic approach to resilience by ensuring that organizational capabilities, resource allocation and strategic foresight are aligned to preserve and enhance performance under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

Amgen announced a restructuring plan during the second half of 2014 to reduce its staff and facilities footprint by approximately 23% by the end of 2015, thereby enabling the reallocation of resources toward continuing innovation and the launch of new pipeline molecules while improving cost structure. The company is advancing key strategic initiatives to streamline processes, increase agility and efficiency, and improve operating performance across functions, including improved contracting, greater use of shared services and optimized R&D efficiency, and has completed construction of a next-generation biomanufacturing facility in Singapore that is expected to support higher productivity at lower capital and operating cost. To support business continuity and organizational flexibility, Amgen maintains diversified sources of liquidity—cash from operations, marketable securities, commercial paper programs, and a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility—and believes existing funds and access to financing are adequate to meet working capital and strategic capital requirements, including dividends, share repurchases and anticipated acquisitions and licensing activities. The company actively manages risk through foreign currency hedging programs that include net foreign currency exposure hedges for Euro-denominated sales and cross-currency swaps to convert Euro and Pound Sterling debt obligations into U.S. dollars, as well as interest rate swaps to achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt. In monitoring external pressures and operational resilience, Amgen tracks receivable collections from government healthcare providers in regions experiencing economic uncertainty—particularly Southern Europe—and takes appropriate actions to mitigate potential losses, while maintaining inventory at wholesalers at levels consistent with end-user demand to preserve continuity of supply. The business continuity framework is further reinforced by comprehensive risk assessment and governance processes, described in Part I, Item 1A, that underpin forward-looking statements and guide resource allocation decisions. Diversification across more than 75 countries and expansion into growth markets in Latin America, the Middle East and Asia enhances organizational adaptability to market turbulence. Research and development activities are organized into discovery research and translational sciences, later stage clinical programs and marketed product support to ensure systematic progression of assets and alignment of resource deployment. Ongoing initiatives to rationalize discretionary spending, optimize sourcing, and refine process efficiency reflect Amgen’s commitment to maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions and to preserving organizational integrity and performance in the face of internal and external variations.

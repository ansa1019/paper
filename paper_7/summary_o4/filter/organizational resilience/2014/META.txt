The company maintains substantial liquidity through cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and a $6.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility to support working capital, strategic initiatives and general corporate purposes, and anticipates these available funds and credit facilities will meet its operational cash needs for the foreseeable future. It assesses risks and uncertainties in its critical accounting policies, including loss contingencies, uncertain tax positions and revenue recognition, recording valuation allowances and provisions for probable losses when amounts can be reasonably estimated. To support ongoing business continuity and adaptation to growth, the company continues to expand data center capacity and technical infrastructure, reversing lease abandonment expenses upon re-occupying facilities, and anticipates capital expenditures of approximately $2.8 to $3.2 billion in 2015. The organization regularly forecasts changes in user engagement, such as the continuing decline of personal-computer usage and the shift toward mobile access, and adapts payments infrastructure and monetization models accordingly, mandating its payments infrastructure for games and managing net settlements and sell-to-cover approaches to control operational cash outflows and tax obligations. It reviews contractual obligations, including operating and capital leases and uncertain tax liabilities, and confirms that it has no off-balance-sheet arrangements. Seasonality in advertising spending, foreign exchange re-measurements, equity financing activities and share-based compensation are monitored and adjusted each period to preserve or improve functioning despite external pressures and performance variability. This systemic approach to resource deployment, risk assessment, strategic planning and recognition of environmental disruptions reflects the companyâ€™s ability to absorb strain and maintain integrity and performance under challenging conditions.

Microsoft’s MD&A discloses that the company continues to invest in datacenters and other infrastructure to support its devices and services, enabling businesses to deploy applications in their own datacenter, a partner’s datacenter, or in Microsoft datacenters “with common security, management, and administration across all environments, with the flexibility and scale they desire,” thereby supporting business continuity and operational flexibility. The shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale—larger datacenters can deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; larger datacenters can coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds—and “creates the opportunity for businesses to focus on innovation while leaving non-differentiating activities to reliable and cost-effective providers.” Microsoft’s strategy “requires continuing investment in datacenters and other infrastructure to support our devices and services” and in research and development, including “increased investment in new products and services in our devices engineering group” and “in our applications and services engineering group,” to address dynamic customer demands, industry trends, and competitive forces. In July 2014 the company announced a restructuring plan intended to “increase agility, streamline engineering processes, move faster and more efficiently, and simplify our organization,” recognizing that “the market for software, devices, and cloud-based services is dynamic and highly competitive” and that it “must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.” Risk management initiatives, such as the use of derivative instruments to “manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit,” maintenance of a $5.0 billion credit facility as a back-up for the commercial paper program, and holding cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments predominantly in highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities diversified among industries and issuers, support the organization’s ability to absorb external and internal variations and preserve functioning under both nominal and extreme conditions. Financial disclosures further affirm that “existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations” are expected to be sufficient to fund operating activities, dividends, debt repayments, acquisitions, and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and thereafter, with options such as repatriation of foreign earnings or domestic debt and equity issuances available if additional capital is required, thereby underpinning resilience in the face of adversity.

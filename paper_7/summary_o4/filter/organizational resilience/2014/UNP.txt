During 2014, management continued focusing on safety to reduce risk and eliminate incidents for our employees, our customers and the public, achieving our best ever reportable personal injury incidents per 200,000 employee-hours and improving our full-year reportable derailment incidents per million train miles by 7%, demonstrating our employees’ dedication to our safety initiatives and our continuous improvement culture (“courage to care,” “total safety culture” and UP Way) and reflecting ongoing prevention and mitigation efforts for at-grade crossing improvements with new approaches planned for 2015 to reduce exposure to crossing accidents. In network operations, the company will continue to add resources to support growth, improve service and replenish our surge capability, while balancing terminal capacity with mainline capacity and planning major classification yard construction and intermodal, automotive and chemicals facilities to enhance fluidity and resilience of the rail network. Our free cash flow definition and disclosures underscore management’s emphasis on generating cash without external financings to support liquidity and operational continuity. We analyze fuel price volatility and the timing impact on earnings as our fuel surcharge programs trail fluctuations by approximately two months, acknowledging uncertainty around projections and planning for positive and negative volume impacts. The 2015 capital plan of approximately $4.3 billion allocates 55–60% to renewing and improving existing assets, including track infrastructure, locomotives, freight cars, containers and positive train control, to maintain system integrity and safe operations under extreme conditions. We monitor our debt-to-net-worth coverage ratio under our revolving credit facility and receivables securitization facility to ensure continued access to capital markets, while sensitivity analyses for variable-rate debt and market risk for fixed-rate debt illustrate our risk-mitigation practices. Derivative instruments are used, under formal documentation and effectiveness testing, to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and fuel prices. Depreciation studies, asset grouping and periodic reassessment of service lives ensure that replacement strategies and accumulated depreciation reflect actual usage patterns and resource allocation decisions, supporting performance maintenance and adaptability. Labor agreements remain in effect under the Railway Labor Act as negotiations proceed, preserving operational flexibility and workforce stability. Environmental and personal injury liabilities are accrued based on actuarial analyses of asserted and unasserted claims, reflecting management’s approach to risk assessment, provision for remediation and insurance recoveries. These combined efforts—ranging from safety culture and asset renewal to financial resourcefulness and risk management—illustrate the railroad’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite internal and external disturbances.

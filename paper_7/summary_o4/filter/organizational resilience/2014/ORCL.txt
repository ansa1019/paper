Oracle’s annual report emphasizes that its products and services are engineered to work together in the cloud and in the data center as enterprise-grade, reliable, secure and interoperable solutions, offering customers a choice in deployment models to best meet their IT needs and enabling them to evolve and transform their on-premise or cloud environments at an appropriate pace. The company designs its software offerings to operate on both single-server and clustered configurations, and it engineers its hardware systems with virtualization and management capabilities for rapid deployment, efficient infrastructure management and performance maintenance, thereby helping customers absorb internal and external variations and preserve system integrity under varied conditions. An important element of Oracle’s corporate strategy is to deliver reliable, secure and scalable products built upon industry standards that function together or independently, supported by continued investments of $5.2 billion, $4.9 billion and $4.5 billion in research and development in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and through targeted acquisitions that expand its portfolio, accelerate innovation, broaden customer choice and strengthen competitive position. The company’s software license updates, product support and hardware support contracts—renewed by substantially all customers on one-year terms—ensure operational continuity and resilience, while its global blended delivery model for consulting, advanced customer support and education services optimizes responsiveness to customer challenges. Oracle applies rigorous risk assessment in revenue recognition for multi-element arrangements, accrues liabilities for probable legal and restructuring obligations at fair value, and uses long-term customer financing alongside interest rate, cross-currency and net investment hedges to mitigate financial exposures, including those arising from hyperinflationary economies such as Venezuela. These practices, together with proactive restructuring plans, systematic capital allocation and contingency planning, reflect the firm’s ability to adapt, reconfigure resources and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

Management notes that operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis with minimal day-to-day involvement by corporate headquarters and that senior corporate management focuses on significant capital allocation decisions and governance practices, including communicating the “tone at the top” and resolving governance-related issues, thereby preserving organizational functioning under varying conditions. In our insurance operations, underwriting decisions are delegated to unit managers while investing decisions “with limited exceptions” are made by our chairman and CEO, reflecting decentralized decision-making and operational flexibility. Our insurance underwriting businesses experience significant volatility from catastrophe loss events yet maintain extraordinary capital strength—statutory surplus of $129 billion as of December 31, 2014—and insist on “safety over yield” with respect to cash and equivalents to ensure business continuity and resource availability. We believe investment and derivative gains and losses “have caused and will likely continue to cause significant volatility” in periodic earnings, but that such volatility is largely “meaningless in terms of understanding our reported results or evaluating our economic performance,” reflecting an ability to absorb strain without compromising operations. In our rail operations, “severe winter weather” and service-related challenges negatively impacted volumes and revenues, prompting us to add capacity through capital investments, system improvements and new hires to “meet customer demand and improve and maintain service levels,” while continuing to “work diligently to address service issues without compromising safety.” Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses made approximately $11.8 billion of capital expenditures in 2014 and forecast $12.3 billion in 2015, funded by cash flow and debt issuances to sustain operational flexibility. Corporate policies restrict share repurchases so as not to reduce consolidated cash and cash equivalent holdings below $20 billion, ensuring redundant liquidity and financial strength, and we maintain a strong balance sheet with cash and investments of approximately $217.2 billion as of December 31, 2014. While regulatory changes under the Dodd-Frank Act “may adversely affect some of our business activities,” they are “not currently expected to have a material impact” on our consolidated results or condition, demonstrating proactive risk assessment and mitigation to preserve organizational resilience.

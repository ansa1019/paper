We maintain our financial strength while advancing our research and early-stage development programs, balancing the risks inherent in drug development through a diversified research portfolio in cystic fibrosis, oncology and neurology that may provide future pipeline candidates and allow us to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite uncertainty. We closely monitor the results of our discovery, clinical trials and nonclinical studies and frequently evaluate our programs in light of new data and scientific, business and commercial insights, with the objective of balancing risk and potential, recognizing that this process can result in abrupt changes in focus and priorities as new information becomes available and as we gain additional understanding of our ongoing programs and potential new programs, as well as those of our competitors. In response to declining sales of incivek, we reduced our focus on marketing and eliminated our U.S. field-based sales force, withdrew the product from the market, recorded intangible asset impairment charges and reallocated resources to Kalydeco and next-generation corrector compounds, thereby reconfiguring our operations to respond to external pressures and preserve operational continuity. We capitalize inventories when the likelihood of regulatory approval is high, periodically assess their recoverability and write down excess and obsolete inventories to net realizable value to mitigate the risk of obsolescence. We recognize net product revenues only when the price is fixed or determinable and estimate government and private payor rebates, chargebacks, discounts and product returns based on payor mix and market data, adjusting our estimates as actual information becomes available. We rely on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash flows from product sales as primary sources of liquidity, have borrowed $300 million under a senior secured term loan with capacity to request an additional $200 million, and may access strategic collaborations, public or private offerings, milestone payments and royalties, while managing negative covenants in our credit agreement to safeguard our long-term liquidity profile. We record restructuring expenses for facility relocations and staff reductions based on probability-weighted discounted cash-flow estimates of lease obligations, projected sublease rental rates and operating costs, review these estimates quarterly and record imputed interest to reflect the time value of money. We test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or upon triggering events by comparing carrying values to fair values derived from present-value models under multiple probability-weighted scenarios, and we consolidate or deconsolidate variable interest entities based on our determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary, presenting the operations of entities with which we no longer have significant continuing involvement as discontinued operations, all of which reflect our systemic perspective and adaptive strategies to maintain integrity and performance under both nominal and extreme conditions.

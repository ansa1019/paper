The Company’s disclosures reflect a broad array of practices and investments that support its capacity to absorb strain and maintain operations under adverse conditions.  It continually monitors and models forward-looking risks and uncertainties—including macroeconomic volatility, sovereign debt crises, deflationary pressures, currency exchange swings, pandemics, natural disasters (such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis and flooding), civil unrest and geopolitical tensions—and maintains significant liquidity and a five-year revolving credit facility to ensure operational continuity and rapid resource deployment.  It hedges foreign exchange exposures with short-term derivative contracts, accrues conservatively for potential travel transaction tax liabilities and aggressively allocates marketing resources—both online and offline—to drive demand and preserve market share despite seasonality and competitive pressures.  The Company pursues strategic diversification through multiple independently managed brands and geographies, ongoing acquisitions (e.g., Kayak and OpenTable) and technology investments in data centers, software and mobile platforms to reconfigure its service offerings, enhance customer experience and expand its resilience against fragmenting markets.  Its financial planning incorporates scenario analyses of holiday timing, exchange-rate–driven shifts in consumer behavior and changing supplier availability, and its integrated risk-management approach—spanning operational, tax, legal, competitive and financial risks—underpins the firm’s ability to adapt, recover and sustain performance under internal and external disturbances.

In its Management’s Discussion and Analysis, the Company employs forward‐looking statements and scenario‐based projections to anticipate market growth, allocate resources, and adapt operating plans amid dynamic economic, competitive and regulatory conditions. By organizing into global business units, global operations, global business services and corporate functions that provide integrated knowledge, standardized processes and data tools, the Company seeks to strengthen inter‐organizational collaboration, mitigate supply‐chain and cost pressures through productivity and savings initiatives, and maintain business continuity in the face of external shocks. A five‐year productivity and cost savings plan to streamline management decision making, manufacturing and work processes exemplifies the system’s ability to reconfigure resources, preserve integrity and sustain performance under challenging conditions. Strategic investments in innovation—ranging from incremental product improvements to game-changing breakthroughs—are described as core to sustaining competitive advantage, supporting adaptation to disruptive change, and enabling the organization to foresee, confront and benefit from sudden market perturbations. The report further highlights the Company’s disciplined approach to risk management, including hedging interest rate, currency and commodity exposures, maintaining diversified funding sources and credit facilities, conducting impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets in slower-growth segments, and remeasuring monetary assets following significant currency devaluations, all of which reflect mechanisms for impact assessment, reconstituting financial trajectories and emerging stronger from adversity.

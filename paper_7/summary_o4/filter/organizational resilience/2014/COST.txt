We have historically adapted our business to changes in economic health and competitive conditions through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increased penetration of private-label items, and by investing in modernizing our information systems to leverage scale and maintain operational flexibility. We drive comparable sales growth by ensuring the right merchandise is available at the right prices, thereby increasing member shopping frequency and leveraging selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales to enhance profitability. We acknowledge external pressures—fluctuations in currency exchange rates, gasoline costs, and vigorous competition—and have strategically responded by reducing prices or holding prices steady despite cost increases, actions that may negatively impact near-term gross margin but support sustained member loyalty and our “pricing authority.” To control costs and preserve organizational health, we maintain compensation levels above industry averages to reduce turnover and enhance employee satisfaction, manage health care and utility expenses, and rely on cash flows from warehouse operations, credit facilities, and short-term investments to meet capital requirements for expansion and remodeling. Our membership format is designed to reinforce loyalty and provide recurring fee revenue, materially influencing profitability. We continue to open new warehouses domestically and internationally, overcoming challenges in securing desirable sites and initial operating profitability, thereby reconfiguring our growth trajectory under evolving market conditions. We believe our liquidity position and operating cash flows are sufficient to support ongoing capital expenditure plans, and we maintain bank credit facilities and letters of credit for general corporate and working capital needs, with the intent to renew facilities to sustain operational continuity. These strategic initiatives and resource management practices collectively reflect our ability to absorb strain, reconfigure resources, and preserve functioning under varied external disturbances, in alignment with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

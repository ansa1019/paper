We continued to evolve and transform our business model by reallocating resources from the divested diabetes franchise into high-priority areas such as immuno-oncology, entering multiple strategic collaborations to combine Opdivo with other targeted agents, expanding biologics manufacturing capacity in Massachusetts and planning a new facility in Ireland to strengthen production continuity and scalability, and continually evaluating our product portfolio to ensure an appropriate balance of early-stage and late-stage programs, with 30-45% of annual R&D directed to late-stage development. We drive growth of key brands, execute new product launches, invest in our deep pipeline, focus on prioritized markets, maintain a culture of continuous improvement and pursue disciplined capital allocation—including business development transactions and milestone payments—so as to absorb strain, preserve functioning under adverse conditions and reconfigure trajectories toward the future. Our governance and risk-mitigation measures include maintaining revolving credit facilities, managing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities for liquidity, factoring receivables in higher-risk regions, monitoring European economic pressures and foreign-exchange volatility, and implementing inventory management agreements and escalation processes under our SEC consent order to limit sales in excess of expected demand. Annual impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets, accelerated depreciation and selective restructuring initiatives support ongoing operational flexibility and the preservation of integrity and performance amid internal or external disturbances, underscoring our systemic perspective on resilience and our ability to emerge stronger from challenging situations.

Management articulates a strategy “to deliver the integrated architectures, solutions, and outcomes to help our customers grow, manage costs, and mitigate risk,” and highlights a focus “on driving the innovation, speed, agility, and efficiencies in our company” so as to “stay ahead of market transitions.” Over recent years, the company “has been working to transform our business to move from selling individual products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions,” changing how it is organized and delivers technology to “better meet our customers’ requirements” and enhance adaptability. In response to challenging spending environments and emerging macroeconomic uncertainties, Cisco “announced a restructuring plan that will impact up to 6,000 employees” and “expects to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from the restructuring actions in our key growth areas such as data center, software, security, and cloud,” thereby reallocating resources to preserve performance. The firm identifies that “inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence, particularly in light of current macroeconomic uncertainties and conditions,” and “regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments” as part of ongoing risk mitigation. To support business continuity under varying customer financing needs, Cisco “provides financing to certain end-user customers and channel partners to enable sales of our products, services, and networking solutions” while maintaining “allowances for credit loss” based on internal historical experience and external economic conditions, recognizing that “determining expected default frequency rates and loss factors … are complex and subjective.” Financial resilience is underpinned by a substantial portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and investments, a $3 billion revolving credit facility, and a commercial paper program, with management stating that “our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments … for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends.” The company defines free cash flow as “net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment” and “intends to return a minimum of 50 % of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders,” while asserting that “based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated by operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy … our liquidity requirements … for at least the next 12 months.” Governance of financial and operational risk further includes detailed impairment testing for goodwill and purchased intangible assets “based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction,” fair value measurement hierarchies, revenue deferral strategies in multi-element arrangements, and detailed assessments of uncertainty in income tax positions by considering “all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies.”

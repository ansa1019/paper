On an on-going basis, we monitor the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry and the markets in which we compete and assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and to better align expenses with revenues, while preserving our ability to make the investments in research and development projects, capital, our people and other programs that we believe are important to drive our growth; as a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for long-term success, including a 2014 plan estimated to incur total pre-tax charges of approximately $250 million to $300 million to reduce gross annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately $175 million to $225 million by the end of 2015, with a substantial portion of the savings expected to be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives. Our organizational strength is supported by strong liquidity and business continuity measures, including $587 million of cash and cash equivalents, $1.269 billion of cash generated by operating activities in 2014, a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility maturing in April 2017, $300 million of available borrowings under a trade‐receivables facility, accounts receivable factoring programs in Europe and Japan, and standby letters of credit primarily for workers’ compensation collateral. We believe our investment-grade credit profile reflects the size and diversity of our product portfolio, leading share positions in served markets, strong cash flow, solid financial fundamentals and disciplined financial strategy, which together with prudent investment of excess cash in short-term diversified instruments and maintenance of working capital of $760 million, will be sufficient to fund our operations, invest in our infrastructure, pay legal-related liabilities, fund possible mergers and acquisitions, service existing debt and return value to investors for at least the next twelve months. To support our future orientation and adaptability, we define emerging markets as 20 developing countries with strong growth potential based on economic and healthcare sector conditions, and we have increased our investment in infrastructure in these countries to expand presence and strengthen relationships in order to grow net sales and market share. In addition, we manage risk through the renegotiation of royalty agreements to lower rates, accruals for legal and product liability exposures, impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets, contingent consideration fair-value adjustments and provisions for restructuring-related charges, all of which help us absorb internal and external variations and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions.

Nike’s management discussion describes a multifaceted approach to maintaining performance under external pressures by driving operational excellence—“reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency, product design, and innovation,” “making our supply chain a competitive advantage,” “improving working capital efficiency,” “deploying capital effectively,” and “leveraging existing infrastructure across our portfolio of businesses” to eliminate duplication and preserve functioning under challenging conditions. The company continuously adapts to macroeconomic uncertainties by expanding direct‐to‐consumer channels—opening new stores, growing e-commerce and comparable store sales—and by adjusting inventory levels based on futures orders and underlying demand trends. Significant investments in digital capabilities, corporate infrastructure, property, plant and equipment reflect resource allocation and strategic foresight to support long‐term growth trajectories and operational flexibility. To mitigate financial risks and preserve liquidity, Nike employs a centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program—including standard currency rates, a foreign currency adjustment program with key suppliers, and forward and option contracts—to buffer translation and transaction exposures, while its $1 billion commercial paper program, revolving credit facility, shelf registrations for debt issuances, and policy of indefinitely reinvesting foreign earnings ensure access to financial resources. Through disciplined cash flow management, share repurchases, dividend policies and strategic hedging of net investments in foreign subsidiaries, the company demonstrates resilience strategies aimed at preserving organizational health, sustaining performance under pressure, and emerging stronger from adverse conditions.

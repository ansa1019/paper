Bank of America’s MD&A outlines a rigorous risk management framework that underpins its organizational resilience by embedding a strong risk culture, defined risk appetite and disciplined risk-management processes (“identify, measure, monitor, control”) into all business activities, overseen by the Board, Enterprise Risk Committee and Management Risk Committee. It details proactive balance-sheet management actions—shifting from less-liquid loans to high-quality liquid securities, optimizing deposit and loan composition, aligning with Basel 3 liquidity coverage ratio requirements—and maintaining excess global liquidity sources in cash and unencumbered securities to ensure continuity of operations. The corporation conducts enterprise-wide stress tests and liquidity runway analyses to project net interest income and capital under severe scenarios, and holds detailed contingency funding plans for capital, liquidity and recovery planning. Ongoing refinements to capital allocations across lines of business, completion of the New BAC cost-savings program ahead of schedule, and active hedging of interest-rate, foreign-exchange, credit and trading risks through derivatives and asset-liability management demonstrate agility and resource reconfiguration under dynamic conditions. Consumer and commercial portfolios benefit from adaptive underwriting, concentration limits and workout programs, driving improvements in delinquencies and losses. These measures, together with governance of operational risk, specialized compliance routines and resolution of legacy mortgage exposures, serve to preserve performance, enable positive adjustment under challenging conditions and strengthen the enterprise’s capacity to emerge stronger from disruptive events.

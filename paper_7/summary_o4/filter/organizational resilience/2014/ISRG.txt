Management focuses its organization and investments on developing, marketing and training for those products and procedures where da Vinci can bring significant patient value relative to alternative treatment options, reflecting strategic resource allocation and operational flexibility. Recurring revenue has generally grown at a faster rate than system revenue in recent fiscal years, driven by procedure adoption on a growing installed base and the structured deferral and ratable recognition of service contract revenue, thereby supporting business continuity and resource reconfiguration. We terminated our distribution relationship with Adachi in Japan and now market, sell and service our products directly; if we are unable to effectively transition the sales, marketing, regulatory and other operational functions, our Japanese business could be disrupted. Future demand for da Vinci surgical systems will be impacted by procedure growth rates, market response to our recently launched Xi system, economic pressure and uncertainty at hospitals associated with the Affordable Care Act, evolving system utilization and point-of-care dynamics, variability in reimbursement cycles and the timing of regulatory clearances in international markets, as well as other economic and geopolitical factors, underscoring the need for adaptive strategies and risk assessment. Various media and product liability lawsuits have questioned patient safety, efficacy, training adequacy, cost structures and sales practices; we believe such negative publicity likely will continue to delay or adversely impact procedure adoption, system sales and revenue growth, prompting us to enter into tolling agreements to pause statutes of limitations, engage in mediation, record pre-tax charges to reflect estimated settlement costs, and submit alternative summary reports to the FDA MAUDE database as part of our post-market surveillance process. In September 2014, we stopped shipping the EndoWrist Stapler 45, advised customers to suspend use, conducted an investigation that uncovered multiple failure modes, voluntarily initiated a field recall, refined design elements and manufacturing processes to address the failure modes, and began shipping replacement instruments, illustrating emergency management, resilience engineering and continuous improvement. We continue to make strategic acquisitions of intellectual property and related technologies, acquire land for future expansion and invest in research and development, demonstrating our long-term orientation, resource generation and capacity to adapt to future challenges.

During 2014, the company and its subsidiaries implemented an enterprise-wide cost savings initiative, determined in 2013, focused on improving productivity and reducing O&M expenses to enhance operational flexibility and resource allocation under challenging conditions. FPL continued significant investments in plant in service, including the Riviera Beach combined-cycle power plant, Port Everglades modernization and long-term natural gas supplies, while maintaining regulatory rate predictability under its 2012 rate agreement, thereby reinforcing service continuity, resource adequacy and business continuity against regulatory and market pressures. Nee and its subsidiaries maintain diversified funding sources—cash flow from operations, short- and long-term borrowings, equity issuances and proceeds from the sale of differential membership and noncontrolling interests—together with credit facilities and guarantee arrangements to preserve liquidity and capital structure targets that support strong investment-grade credit ratings and rapid access to liquidity under extreme or unexpected conditions. FPL’s storm restoration framework provides capacity to absorb up to $122 million of future prudently incurred storm recovery costs without immediate rate relief, illustrating resilience to adverse weather events. The company employs comprehensive market risk management policies—including value-at-risk modeling, commodity, interest-rate and equity derivative contracts, credit limits, collateral requirements and master netting agreements—to mitigate exposures to commodity price swings, interest-rate variability, credit risk and market volatility, thereby preserving financial performance and system integrity. Regulatory deferrals and cost recovery clauses allow for deferral of fuel, nuclear cost recovery and storm restoration costs as regulatory assets and liabilities, enabling maintenance of positive adjustment of financial results under fluctuating conditions. Commitments to capital expenditures, pipeline development and renewable project backlogs are financed through lines of credit, revolving facilities and project-level financing secured by guarantees, providing the flexibility to reconfigure investment trajectories and sustain continued growth and operational resilience amid environmental turbulence, regulatory changes and market disruptions.

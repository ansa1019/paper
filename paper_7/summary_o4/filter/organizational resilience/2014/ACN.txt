The disclosure repeatedly describes the elimination of net income or expense attributable to the equity interests held by certain current and former members of Accenture leadership and their permitted transferees in Accenture SCA, Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. and, since January 2002, immaterial amounts in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary, with reference to the “business-organizational structure” under which these interests are consolidated; these provisions for noncontrolling interests and our approach to consolidating and attributing earnings reflect the firm’s structural arrangements for allocating financial resources, preserving integrity of reported results under varying stakeholder claims, and maintaining consistent performance attribution across our organizational entities.

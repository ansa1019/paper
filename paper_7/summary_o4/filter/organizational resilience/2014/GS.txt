Goldman Sachs describes a comprehensive resilience framework centered on maintaining a liquid balance sheet, robust capital and funding buffers, and rigorous risk management governance to preserve or improve functioning under stress.  The firm pre-funds its estimated potential cash and collateral needs in a stressed environment by holding a global core liquid assets portfolio of unencumbered, highly liquid government securities and cash at both parent and subsidiary levels, supplemented by a contingency funding plan for crisis and market-stress scenarios.  It proactively manages asset-liability mismatches and funds inventory through diversified secured financings, term unsecured borrowings and deposits across currencies, tenors and counterparties to support operational continuity.  Capital planning and stress-testing processes—incorporating internally constructed severely adverse scenarios alongside CCAR and DFAST requirements—project sources and uses of capital, set Common Equity Tier 1 and leverage targets, and maintain contingency capital buffers, while a contingency capital plan outlines triggers, mitigants and communication protocols in the event of material capital shortfalls.  A multilayered governance structure, from Board oversight through firmwide and divisional committees to independent control and support functions, enforces policies, limits and escalation procedures for market, credit, liquidity and operational risks, supplemented by annual resolution and recovery plans and disclosure of business continuity objectives and the effectiveness of information security and risk-management programs.

Management’s discussion and analysis acknowledges that actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in the annual report, reflecting an ongoing process of risk assessment and mitigation under challenging conditions. Qualcomm has reconfigured its operations through a corporate reorganization that centralized product and R&D functions within Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. while licensing remains with Qualcomm Incorporated, and it periodically reassesses its management reporting and segment structure in response to divestitures such as the sale of its Omnitracs division. The company allocates over 75% of its free cash flow to stock repurchases and dividends, balancing returns to stockholders with investments in research and development, strategic technology initiatives and early‐stage companies across digital media, energy, healthcare, automotive and other industries. In its QMT division, it updated business plans to reflect reduced cash flow expectations, tested long‐lived assets and goodwill for impairment and recorded charges, demonstrating its capacity to absorb financial strain and preserve its integrity and performance. It continues to invest significant resources in the advancement of CDMA, OFDMA, Snapdragon and other technologies while pursuing acquisitions and strategic investments to open new markets and strengthen its competitive position. Qualcomm navigates external pressures such as regulatory investigations and licensing disputes in China, taking steps to address non-compliance and underreporting despite uncertain timing, and manages liquidity through a mix of U.S.- and non-U.S.-based cash, marketable securities and potential borrowings, anticipating future capital needs for research and development, capital expenditures and strategic transactions. The preparation of its financial statements involves estimates and judgments subject to inherent uncertainty, including asset valuations, marketable securities impairments and uncertain tax positions, enabling the company to identify impairment indicators, adjust carrying amounts, and maintain system resilience and operational flexibility. The company is also evaluating the adoption of new revenue recognition standards and employs non-GAAP measures such as free cash flow to facilitate strategic foresight, adjust to market volatility and sustain performance under pressure.

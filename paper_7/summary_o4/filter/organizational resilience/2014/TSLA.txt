In 2014, we significantly increased our sales and service footprint worldwide, entered several new markets including China, and accelerated the rollout of our supercharging network to support business continuity and customer needs; to meet anticipated demand, we executed a plan to increase our combined Model S and Model X production capacity to over 2,000 units per week by the end of 2015, beginning our production ramp by transitioning to a new final assembly line and upgrading our body center, and planning further investments in production capacity, including a new paint shop and body shop for Model X. While significant cost improvements for Model S were achieved through higher vehicle production volumes, supply-chain efficiencies and component cost reductions, one-time manufacturing inefficiencies associated with transitioning to our new final assembly line and the introduction of all-wheel-drive dual-motor Model S impeded planned deliveries, leading us to plan for significant production efficiencies in Model S and a faster initial ramp for Model X and to acknowledge that any unexpected issues with capacity expansion or Model X launch could affect our ability to meet future targets. To lower manufacturing costs and improve gross margin, we expect ongoing process-improvement and cost-reduction initiatives, combined with a favorable vehicle mix, to allow us to achieve a 30 percent gross margin on Model S by the end of 2015, while recognizing that typical production and supply-chain inefficiencies for new product introductions will suppress Model X margins for several quarters. To support long-term growth, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $1.5 billion in 2015 as we expand production capacity, complete Model X development, and invest in the Gigafactory, our stores and service centers, while operating expenses will grow at a more moderate pace, with research and development expenses increasing to complete validation and testing of future products and selling, general and administrative expenses managed to improve operational efficiency. We are developing the Tesla Gigafactory as an integrated industrial complex for battery precursor, cell, module and pack production in partnership with suppliers such as Panasonic, preparing land, buildings and utilities, investing in production equipment, and managing the facility to integrate external knowledge and mitigate the risk of longer build-out timelines and higher costs. In our financing activities, we issued convertible senior notes and entered into hedges and warrant transactions to offset dilution and support liquidity, and as of December 31, 2014, we held $1.91 billion in cash and cash equivalents to fund ongoing operations, capital projects and service infrastructure expansion, while acknowledging that prevailing economic or business factors may require alternative financing. We maintain rigorous working capital management, including customer deposits of $257.6 million, inventory valuation and write-down processes based on future demand forecasts, warranty reserve reviews, and deferred-revenue recognition for leasing and resale-value guarantee programs, each requiring ongoing judgment and adjustment to preserve organizational integrity and performance under internal or external variations and disturbances.

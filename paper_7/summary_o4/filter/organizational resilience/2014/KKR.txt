KKR’s management discussion describes a patient and disciplined investment approach that leverages world-class people, deep industry knowledge, a diversified capital base, an integrated global platform and operating consultants to drive growth and value creation even under challenging conditions, illustrating the maintenance of positive adjustment and performance. The firm has expanded its geographic presence and built new businesses—credit, special situations, hedge funds, collateralized loan obligations, capital markets, infrastructure, energy and real estate—by reconfiguring its resources, leveraging core principles and intellectual capital, and offering innovative, tailored solutions, thereby enhancing operational flexibility and competitive advantage. KKR uses its balance sheet as a strategic capital source to grow and align interests with stakeholders, and with over 75 percent of fee-paying assets locked in for at least eight years, it maintains significant flexibility to make investments and select exits under varying market pressures. Through a pre-eminent global platform of offices, the firm continuously sources transactions, raises capital and provides both traditional and non-traditional financing, while a dedicated balance sheet committee and risk committee monitor cash flows, underwriting exposures, liquidity and market risks—including interest rate shifts, currency volatility and commodity price declines—to support business continuity, preserve system integrity and quickly reconstitute strategic initiatives in response to economic, financial and environmental perturbations.

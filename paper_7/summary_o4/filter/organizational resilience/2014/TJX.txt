During fiscal 2015, the company continued to generate strong cash flows, allowing it to return value to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases while reinvesting in the business by adding new stores, remodeling existing ones and strengthening its infrastructure to support the next level of growth. In anticipation of future challenges, the company announced in fiscal 2016 an initiative to raise wages for U.S. store associates to at least $9.00 per hour, representing an investment in human capital and organizational health. To mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on merchandise purchases, the company routinely enters into inventory-related hedging instruments, marking them to market each period and effectively offsetting gains or losses when inventory is received and paid for. The timing of receipt and payment of merchandise purchases drove changes in inventory and accounts payable that favorably impacted operating cash flows. The company funded its qualified pension plan with a voluntary contribution of $150 million, updated mortality assumptions in light of new actuarial data and evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, goodwill and tradenames at least annually or when indicators of impairment arise. Debt management activities included issuing $750 million of seven-year notes and redeeming $400 million of higher-cost notes, reflecting strategic reconfiguration of financing. Share repurchase programs are executed based on assessments of excess cash flow, liquidity, market conditions and business prospects, with plans to repurchase $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion of stock in fiscal 2016. The company believes its cash and cash equivalents, including $1.2 billion held outside the U.S. of which $413.9 million is indefinitely reinvested, together with internally generated funds and credit facilities, are more than adequate to meet its operating needs. A reserve for remaining obligations of former operations, primarily real estate leases, is maintained and adjusted based on assumptions regarding lease assignments, subleases and indemnifications. The transition to a self-insured casualty insurance program requires actuarial estimates of total claims, demonstrating ongoing risk assessment. Critical accounting policies—inventory valuation under the retail method, impairment testing, retirement obligations, share-based compensation valuation, casualty insurance accruals, uncertain tax positions and reserves for former operations—rely on significant judgments and assumptions and serve as mechanisms to preserve system integrity, maintain performance under internal and external disturbances and ensure preparedness for exceptional conditions.

In 2014, Comcast undertook a series of operational and strategic measures to preserve and improve its performance under a range of competitive, regulatory and economic pressures, including the ongoing deployment of wireless gateways that integrate a customer’s router, cable modem and voice adapter to enhance in-home device performance, the expansion of indoor and outdoor Wi-Fi hotspots for high-speed Internet customers, and the rollout of its IP- and cloud-enabled X1 video platform and cloud DVR technology in over 50% of its markets. The company continued to expand its business services portfolio—featuring hosted voice, Ethernet networking and cellular backhaul—to strengthen its service innovation and revenue diversification, and it pursued home security and automation offerings to address evolving customer needs. Comcast sought to maintain a consistent operating margin in its cable communications segment through rate adjustments, the sale of additional advanced services, disciplined expense control and ongoing operational efficiencies, balancing promotional incentives against rate increases to optimize customer acquisition and revenue. To reinforce its competitive advantage, the company invested substantially in original and sports programming rights across its cable networks and broadcast television businesses and committed to continued investment in filmed entertainment and new Universal theme-park attractions. Strategic initiatives included the merger agreement with Time Warner Cable and related divestiture transactions—comprising a spin-off of cable systems, system exchanges and sales—to reconstitute and reconfigure its asset base, manage debt and meet regulatory conditions. Throughout the year, Comcast managed its liquidity and financial resilience by leveraging cash flows from operations, maintaining significant availability under revolving credit facilities and commercial paper programs, testing compliance with leverage covenants, repurchasing shares, paying dividends and planning capital expenditures to ensure operational flexibility and resource availability in the face of seasonal, cyclical and competitive challenges.

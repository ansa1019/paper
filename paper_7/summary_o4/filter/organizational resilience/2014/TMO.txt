The company’s strategy to “expand product lines and services by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses” and to integrate acquired businesses such as Life Technologies into its Life Sciences Solutions segment reflects an adaptive reconfiguration of resources and capabilities to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations. The company’s practical process improvement (PPI) business system, productivity improvements from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions (including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities) and low cost region manufacturing exemplify operational flexibility and resource reconfiguration to preserve or improve functioning under constraints and pressures. The identification and execution of restructuring actions to streamline operations, resulting in annual cost savings of approximately $120 million beginning in 2014 and further planned charges of $70 million in 2015, illustrate dynamic capabilities and proactive resource redeployment for performance maintenance. The maintenance of substantial liquidity, including cash and short-term investments of $1.35 billion as of December 31, 2014, a revolving credit facility increased to $2.00 billion, and the deliberate strategy to leave undrawn amounts equivalent to outstanding commercial paper, demonstrates risk assessment, resource generation and strategic foresight to meet cash requirements for at least the next 24 months and to ensure business continuity under nominal or extreme market volatility. The evaluation of contractually committed resources, such as operating lease obligations, letters of credit, bank guarantees and purchase obligations, along with continuous management judgments based on historical experience, current market and economic conditions, and other assumptions, reflects a systemic perspective and anticipatory measures to mitigate hazards, sustain organizational health and maintain integrity of operations under external variations and disturbances. The segment-based adjusted operating income metrics facilitate comparison of core results, guiding managerial skills and decision making in strategic adaptation, while impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets under various cash flow and discount rate assumptions underscores vigilant risk mitigation and resilience strategies in the face of potential adverse business conditions.

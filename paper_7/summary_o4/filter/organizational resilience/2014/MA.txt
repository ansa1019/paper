Mastercard continuously monitors political and economic conditions around the world to identify opportunities for continued growth and to evaluate evolving industry dynamics, maintains significant cash, cash equivalents and investment securities balances together with robust cash flow-generating capabilities and access to a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility extended through 2019—which the company may draw upon for general corporate purposes, including business continuity planning and settlement failures—to ensure sufficient liquidity under adverse conditions. The company allocates resources to support strategic initiatives, including capacity growth in its global payments network infrastructure, acquisitions and technology investments, and funds advertising, sponsorships and marketing programs designed to drive brand acceptance and usage even amid external pressures. Mastercard’s risk management practices mitigate exposures from foreign currency fluctuations through derivative contracts and ongoing remeasurement of assets and liabilities, guarantee the settlement of branded transactions while evaluating the potential impact of regional or global economic distress on counterparties, and assess loss contingencies and legal proceedings on a regular basis to measure and reserve for probable liabilities. In addition, the company has aligned its legal entity and tax structures to improve the efficiency of global cash deployment and optimize its effective income tax rate, regularly reviews future obligations—such as lease commitments, employee benefit funding requirements and customer rebate accruals—and believes that its liquidity, borrowing capacity and capital resources are sufficient to satisfy operational requirements, withstand market volatility and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity.

On July 22, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of Hittite Microwave Corporation, financed through a combination of existing cash on hand and a 90-day term loan facility of $2.0 billion, recognized acquired assets and liabilities at fair value and recorded goodwill and intangible assets, thereby reallocating financial resources to bolster its market position and adapt to competitive and technological disruptions. Management “monitor[s] global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis, and continue[s] to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenues,” undertaking multiple restructuring actions that generated annual cost savings and will be reinvested into future growth initiatives. Research and development expenses increased by 9% year-over-year, reflecting higher variable compensation linked to profitability, increased employee-related benefits and other operational spending—including approximately $15 million attributable to the acquisition—and underscoring the Company’s view that “a continued commitment to R&D is essential to maintain product leadership” and drive innovation. The Company maintains cash and short-term investments with high credit quality counterparties, “continually monitor[s] the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify[s] our investments in order to minimize our credit risk,” and believes its existing liquidity and anticipated financing sources will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, R&D efforts, dividends and stock repurchases for at least the next twelve months. Inventory management practices reflect resilience to demand variability—valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market, writing down slow-moving or obsolete inventory to net realizable value, and increasing production to support forecasted sales demand—while revenue recognition policies defer distributor sales until products are resold, aligning revenue with end-customer delivery and mitigating credit and return risks. Liquidity and capital resource strategies include maintaining compliance with covenants under senior unsecured notes and a senior unsecured revolving credit facility, preserving operational flexibility to finance acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and share repurchases based on performance, outlook and available cash. The Company “review[s] property, plant, and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable,” conducts annual goodwill impairment tests using discounted cash flow methodologies, and revalues contingent consideration obligations each period, embedding rigorous risk assessment, adaptability and continuity planning into its financial and operational governance.

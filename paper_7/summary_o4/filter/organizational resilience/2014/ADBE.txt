We make assumptions, judgments and estimates on a regular basis in preparing our consolidated financial statements and discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors to ensure our revenue recognition, business combinations, goodwill impairment testing and income tax provisions can absorb strain and preserve functioning under varying internal and external conditions. The adoption of our Creative Cloud subscription model has transformed our business model to deliver revenue ratably over contract terms, driving more predictable and recurring cash inflows, and we expect our subscription revenue will continue to increase as a result of our investments in new SaaS and subscription models. We are using certain performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our overall Digital Media segment, including annualized recurring revenue, and continue to implement targeted strategies—enhancing product value, phased promotions and integration of acquisitions such as Neolane and Behance—to reconfigure resource deployment and adapt to market disruptions. Our currency hedging program is used to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency impact to revenue, and we have entered into interest rate swaps to hedge changes in benchmark interest rates, thereby supporting business continuity. We maintain a five-year $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement and $1.5 billion of senior notes due 2015 and 2020, and we use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash to ensure system integrity under financial variability. We are currently repurchasing common stock under our $2.0 billion authority and enter into structured stock repurchase agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount, balancing resource utilization against foregone returns. We continue to invest in our network and data center infrastructure, including increased hosting and server costs, compensation for additional headcount and depreciation of computer equipment, to support growth and operational flexibility. During fiscal 2014, we initiated our latest restructuring plan and recorded $19.4 million associated with termination benefits and closing redundant facilities to realign our cost structure in response to strategic imperatives. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.

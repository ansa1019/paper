In our management’s discussion and analysis, we highlight that forward‐looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could materially affect future operations and should be read in conjunction with our risk factors, and we have reorganized our business units and reflected prior period amounts accordingly to align our reporting structure and enhance organizational coherence. We continuously evaluate alternatives for efficiently financing capital expenditures, dilution‐management activities and ongoing operations, including the issuance or incurrence of secured and unsecured debt and the refinancing and restructuring of existing debt, and our board has authorized discretionary repurchases of up to $1.0 billion of common stock, subject to market conditions and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash. To mitigate credit risk we invest through high‐credit‐quality institutions and limit concentration with any single obligor, and under our Inotera supply agreement we are obligated to purchase substantially all of Inotera’s output for a three‐year term at market‐based prices, with annual extension negotiations and a subsequent three‐year wind‐down period that would affect our share of capacity. In 2014 our operating cash flows benefitted from a $671 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses offset by a $518 million increase in receivables, reflecting active working capital management, and we estimate capital spending of $3.6 billion to $4.0 billion in 2015 to support growth, operating efficiencies and product quality. To optimize operations, improve efficiency and focus on core memory operations, we entered into various restructuring activities, including winding down 200 mm operations and workforce optimization, and we reduced the dilutive effects of our convertible notes through exchanges, conversions and repurchases using cash generated from operations and proceeds from non‐convertible debt, eliminating notes that would have converted into 118 million shares. We have entered into capped calls to reduce potential dilution from convertible notes, with receivables varying based on the stock price up to specified caps, and maintain available credit facilities of $408 million, subject to receivable balances and other conditions. As of August 28, 2014, $2.8 billion of our cash and equivalents is held by foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested and would be subject to U.S. taxes if repatriated. We regularly review property, plant and equipment for impairment based on undiscounted future cash flows and assess consolidation of variable interest entities by evaluating our power to direct activities and obligation to absorb losses, and our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, requiring projections of average selling prices and volumes that give rise to lower‐of‐cost‐or‐market adjustments. Finally, our business acquisitions involve estimating the fair value of consideration and individual assets and liabilities acquired, incorporating significant judgments and assumptions regarding future cash flows, discount rates and market comparables.

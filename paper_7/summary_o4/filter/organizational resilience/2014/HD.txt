In response to the third-quarter data breach, the company confirmed that the malware was eliminated from its systems, completed a major payment security project providing enhanced encryption of payment card data at the point of sale in all U.S. stores, and is rolling out similar encryption and EMV chip-and-pin technology in Canadian and U.S. stores, while supporting law enforcement efforts to identify responsible parties. It recorded $63 million of pretax expenses related to the breach, partially offset by $30 million of expected insurance proceeds for pretax net expenses of $33 million, and maintains $100 million of network security and privacy liability insurance coverage (above a $7.5 million deductible in fiscal 2014 and above a $10 million deductible in fiscal 2015) to limit exposure to similar losses. The company anticipates significant future expenses for legal, investigative, consulting and remediation activities and continues to evaluate information to record loss estimates when incurred and estimable. To sustain operational flexibility and business continuity, it leverages commercial paper programs with a $2 billion back-up credit facility, uses capital and operating leases to finance real estate, and enters into interest rate swaps to manage its fixed/floating rate debt portfolio. As of February 1, 2015, it held $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and management believes its cash position, access to long-term debt markets and cash flow from operations will fund operating requirements, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, obligations from the data breach and debt payments through the next several fiscal years. Key strategic initiatives—anchored by a customer service transformation deploying a second-generation mobile tool for store associates, a product authority initiative supported by new merchandising assortment planning and pricing tools to match local customer preferences, and an interconnected retail platform integrating buy-online-pick-up-in-store, buy-online-ship-to-store and pilot buy-online-deliver-from-store programs with direct fulfillment centers—demonstrate the company’s systemic approach to adaptability, resource reconfiguration and performance maintenance under evolving market and technological conditions. Inventory shrink estimates are evaluated quarterly and vendor allowances are accrued over incentive periods to optimize resource utilization, while quarterly impairment assessments of long-lived assets at the store level, qualitative goodwill recoverability reviews and planned adoption of updated revenue recognition guidance (ASC 606) illustrate proactive organizational practices to monitor performance, assess risk and maintain integrity under nominal, extreme or exceptional variations in the business environment.

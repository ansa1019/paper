In 2014, as part of our strategy to transform our business to attain approximately 50% of revenue from high-growth adjacent markets by the end of 2015, we continued to focus on introducing a more diverse product portfolio and derived approximately 40% of annual revenues from high-growth markets, including launching differentiated server, embedded and semi-custom SoC products and announcing an ambidextrous computing roadmap to develop custom ARM and x86 cores for 2016. While we believe the pace of the decline in the PC market is slowing, our computing and graphics segment results reflected the ongoing challenges of a competitive consumer PC market, which informed our realignment of the organizational structure effective July 1, 2014 into two reportable segments to better align resources and decision-making with high-growth opportunities. We improved our balance sheet by re-profiling debt maturity schedules and executing selective repurchases of senior and convertible notes, funded in part through borrowings on a $500 million secured revolving line of credit, and issued $500 million of 7.00% and $600 million of 6.75% senior notes to enhance financial flexibility. We secured continuity of our critical manufacturing inputs through multiple amendments to our wafer supply agreement with GlobalFoundries, establishing fixed pricing and volume commitments that mitigate supply risk. To enhance operating efficiencies and cost structure, we implemented an October 2014 restructuring plan involving a global headcount reduction of approximately 6%, real estate footprint alignment, contract and program terminations, facility actions and asset impairments, recording a $57 million restructuring charge with anticipated incremental charges in 2015. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $1.0 billion, combined with anticipated savings from restructuring and availability under our secured revolving line of credit, will be sufficient to fund operations and capital expenditures over the next twelve months and provide resilience against uncertain global economic conditions.

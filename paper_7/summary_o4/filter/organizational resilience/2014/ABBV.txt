AbbVie’s 2014 Management’s Discussion and Analysis describes a range of strategic, operational and financial measures that collectively support the company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve performance under challenging conditions.  Faced with generic competition and the loss of product exclusivity, AbbVie augmented its pipeline through increased funding for emerging mid- and late-stage assets, strategic licensing, collaborations and acquisitions, and pursued regulatory approvals and geographic expansion to secure future revenue streams.  The company leveraged strong operating cash flows—despite transaction and financing costs related to a terminated merger proposal and foreign exchange losses tied to hedging—to support dividends, share repurchases under a new $5.0 billion program, and a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, thereby maintaining financial flexibility and mitigating liquidity risks.  Transition services agreements with Abbott and ongoing investments in stand-alone back-office infrastructure facilitated business continuity and organizational change following the separation.  In outlining its 2015 objectives, AbbVie emphasizes expanding Humira indications, driving launches such as Viekira Pak through payor positioning and market penetration, delivering operating margin improvements via supply-chain efficiencies, and continuing R&D efforts and partnering to address future disruptions.  Credit and receivables management practices—including monitoring government-related balances in southern Europe, factoring arrangements to reduce credit exposure, and allowance analyses for rebates and returns—serve as risk-mitigation mechanisms.  The company’s critical accounting policies and estimates, such as rebate accrual modeling based on internal and external data, actuarial assumptions for pension and post-employment benefits, and periodic impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets, reinforce its capacity to maintain system integrity, adapt to environmental perturbations, and sustain performance under uncertainty.

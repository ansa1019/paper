Blackstone’s discussion of its business environment and liquidity management reflects its ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions by drawing on diverse internal and external resources, reallocating capital across five distinct business segments and accessing multiple sources of liquidity—including committed limited partner capital, realizations from carry and hedge fund investments, cash flows from operating activities and a $1.1 billion revolver and senior note issuances—to preserve or improve functioning despite market volatility, widening credit spreads, regulatory pressures and economic uncertainty. The firm notes that “global equity and debt markets generally had another positive year in 2014, although returns were significantly lower than 2013 levels, with a sharp increase in volatility late in the year,” that “the outlook for global economic growth deteriorated … resulting in … accommodative monetary policies,” yet U.S. fundamentals strengthened, demonstrating adaptability and operational flexibility in the face of external disturbances. Blackstone targets operating expense levels such that “total management and advisory fees exceed total operating expenses each period,” employs opportunistic leverage through reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements to optimize its capital structure under fluctuating conditions, and continually adjusts “fee-earning assets under management” metrics to guide resource deployment, risk assessment and strategic response, thereby preserving integrity and performance while under varying internal or external perturbations. In managing its consolidated and deconsolidated fund entities, Blackstone regularly reassesses its control and consolidates or deconsolidates variable interest entities as needed, ensuring business continuity and systemic resilience across its global investment platform.

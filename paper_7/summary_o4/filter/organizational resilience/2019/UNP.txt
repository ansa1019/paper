Despite significant operational disruptions in 2019, including heavy snowfall, harsh winter conditions and widespread flooding, the company remained focused on implementation of Unified Plan 2020 to operate a safe, reliable and efficient railroad by increasing reliability of its service product, reducing variability in network operations and improving resource utilization costs. The company remained committed to identifying and managing risk and training employees as their work environment changed, deploying a multi-faceted approach to safety that integrates technology, risk assessment, training, employee engagement, quality control and targeted capital investments, and establishing an operating practices command center to identify causes of mainline service interruptions and develop solutions. Terminal rationalization efforts to reduce “car touches,” longer train lengths and consolidation of switching activities under Unified Plan 2020 and G55+0 initiatives were designed to improve asset utilization, reduce freight car terminal dwell by 17%, increase car velocity by 6%, boost locomotive productivity by 13% and workforce productivity by 2%, and better align management structures and decision-making processes to be more agile and responsive to customer needs. Through productivity initiatives, core pricing gains and lower fuel prices, the company achieved an all-time record 60.6% operating ratio despite headwinds from inflation, casualty costs and first-half weather challenges, demonstrating the ability to absorb strain and preserve performance under adversity. The 2020 capital plan of approximately $3.1 billion, with 75–80% allocated to renewing and improving existing capital assets, balances investment in network infrastructure and terminal capacity with capacity and facility projects intended to improve productivity and operational efficiency, including locomotive modernization and freight car replacements. The company maintains financial resilience and liquidity through a $2 billion revolving credit facility, receivables securitization, commercial paper programs and access to capital markets to meet foreseeable cash requirements under varying market conditions, and employs sensitivity analyses and risk management practices to address fuel price volatility, interest rate fluctuations and labor negotiations. Environmental and climate change considerations drive investments in new technologies, training programs and operational changes to increase fuel efficiency and reduce environmental impact. Critical accounting policies support preparedness and recovery, using actuarial analyses to measure personal injury and environmental liabilities, depreciation strategies based on usage and periodic depreciation studies, and modeling of pension and other postretirement benefits, thereby maintaining system integrity and performance under internal and external variations and disturbances.

During fiscal 2019, we acquired and integrated Allegorithmic, Marketo and Magento into our digital media and digital experience reportable segments and, in connection with our business combinations, allocated purchase prices to tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair values at the acquisition dates, recognizing that unanticipated events and circumstances may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions or actual results. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors believed reasonable under the circumstances, regularly evaluate these assumptions and discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors, while acknowledging that actual results could differ materially under different conditions. To support business continuity and operational flexibility, we enter into contracts with third parties for hosting services and use of data center facilities, employ cloud-based features that integrate with on-premise software to provide end-to-end workflow efficiencies and collaboration across teams in real time, and maintain a $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement with no outstanding borrowings and a $2.25 billion term loan and $1.9 billion of senior notes for which we intend to refinance or repay before maturity. We also utilize cash flow hedging programs to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exposure, have established reserves for income taxes and unrecognized tax benefits to address potential exposures and regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes from tax examinations, and recognize that the final determinations could significantly impact our operating results and financial position. We believe that investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to remain competitive and directly related to the timely development of new and enhanced offerings, and we have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of our direct sales force and ecosystem of partners, including marketing agencies, systems integrators and independent software vendors, reflecting a systemic perspective, inter-organizational collaboration and future orientation designed to drive sustained performance, adaptability and growth under both nominal and exceptional market conditions. Our structured stock repurchase agreements and ongoing stock repurchase program are designed to return value to our stockholders, minimize dilution from stock issuances and manage capital resources, and our liquidity and capital resources plans, including scheduled debt repayments and portfolio management of cash, cash equivalents and investments, are intended to preserve system integrity and financial resilience in the face of internal or external variations and disturbances.

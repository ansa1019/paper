The company’s annual report discloses numerous actions and processes that collectively reflect its capacity to absorb strain and maintain or improve functioning under challenging conditions.  During fiscal 2019 the company completed a strategic review of its Mexican operations and opted to sell the business’s assets, incurring charges related to exit and wind-down activities, and initiated a similar strategic review of its Canadian operations that resulted in closure of underperforming stores, SKU rationalization, corporate reorganization and inventory liquidation, thereby reconfiguring resources to support future performance.  Concurrently, the company pursued a multi-year transformation across four key focus areas—driving merchandising excellence, transforming its supply chain through new and relocated bulk distribution centers and cross-dock terminals, delivering operational efficiency via customer-centric scheduling systems and mobile applications for associates, and intensifying customer engagement with dedicated pro-service enhancements and point-of-sale terminals—all of which represent deliberate investments in organizational capabilities, operational flexibility and service innovation to sustain continuity and competitive advantage amid external pressures such as tariff costs and supply chain constraints.  Liquidity management further underpins resilience: cash flows from operations supplemented by short- and long-term borrowings, commercial paper, term loans and unsecured notes have funded strategic investments, capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases, while commercial paper draws are timed to build inventory for seasonal demand.  Risk mitigation and recovery mechanisms include self-insurance programs with actuarially determined reserves for workers’ compensation, general liability, product liability and extended protection plans, and a disciplined process for quarterly impairment testing of long-lived assets at the individual store level—using both market and income approaches that discount projected future cash flows—to ensure system integrity under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.  Through these dynamic processes of adaptation, resource allocation and continuous monitoring, the company demonstrates the maintenance of positive adjustment under adversity, preserving operational continuity and positioning itself for sustainable growth in a turbulent business environment.

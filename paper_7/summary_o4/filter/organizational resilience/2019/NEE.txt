Management employs a suite of financial planning and performance‐monitoring practices—such as adjusted earnings measures used for internal analysis, board reporting and incentive compensation—to enhance its ability to absorb volatility and support continued operations under varying market and regulatory conditions. The Company and its subsidiaries maintain extensive liquidity and capital resources—including cash flows from operations, short‐ and long‐term debt facilities, equity issuances, proceeds from asset sales and credit and letter‐of‐credit programs—to ensure uninterrupted business continuity, preserve operating flexibility and meet capital requirements amid external pressures. Strategic investments in generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure, including the addition of over 2,700 MW of wind and solar capacity and the ongoing expansion of rate base through new clean energy projects, reinforce resilience by bolstering resource deployment and future growth potential. In response to extreme weather events such as Hurricanes Irma and Dorian, FPL recorded storm restoration costs against reserve amortization derived from operational efficiencies rather than passing these charges through customer surcharges, demonstrating adaptive cost‐recovery and crisis management strategies. Risk‐management frameworks—including non-qualifying and cost-recovery hedge programs, derivative instruments to hedge fuel, power, interest rate and foreign‐currency exposures, and active value-at-risk monitoring overseen by an Exposure Management Committee—mitigate earnings volatility and preserve system integrity across business units. The use of master netting agreements, collateral requirements and credit limits curbs counterparty credit risk, while guarantees, surety bonds and indemnification arrangements support project financing, asset disposals and trading activities, underscoring organizational flexibility in resource allocation. Regulatory accounting treatment of deferred gains and losses, nuclear decommissioning and asset retirement obligations enables recovery of prudently incurred costs over the life of assets, sustaining financial health under nominal and exceptional conditions. Collectively, these policies and practices—spanning capital structure management, operational investments, contingency funding, strategic hedging, regulatory mechanisms and rigorous financial governance—embody the Company’s capacity to absorb strain, maintain functionality and adapt to disturbances while positioning the enterprise for sustained performance and growth.

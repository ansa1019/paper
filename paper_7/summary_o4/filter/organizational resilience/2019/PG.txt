Management emphasizes that forward‐looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions subject to risks and uncertainties, and that in periods with significant macroeconomic pressures, the Company maintains a disciplined investment approach to preserve the long‐term health of its businesses without sacrificing resilience to short‐term objectives. The Company acknowledges exposure to global macroeconomic factors, political unrest, trade policy changes and currency fluctuations, any of which could reduce sales or margin, and accordingly strives to mitigate these external disturbances through pricing actions, cost savings projects, sourcing decisions and consistent productivity improvements, including outsourcing, supply chain optimization and workforce restructuring. Foreign exchange and government policy exposures are carefully managed through both operational and financial hedging strategies, including forward contracts and currency swaps, to absorb strain and preserve performance under internal and external variations. The ongoing organization design changes, with the realignment of product categories into sector business units responsible for brand strategy, innovation, supply planning and profit frameworks, exemplify the reconfiguration of organizational structures to enhance operational flexibility and future orientation. Strategic focus on winning consumers through innovation, productivity improvement across goods, marketing and overhead, and the reinvestment of savings into product upgrades, brand communication and R&D reflects adaptive resource deployment to sustain superior performance under dynamic conditions. Operating cash flow provides the primary source of funding for continuity in operations, capital expenditures and shareholder returns, with the Company maintaining strong cash generation capabilities, high quality financial condition and ready access to debt markets to complement resources during exceptional conditions. Significant accounting policies involving subjective estimates—such as revenue recognition accruals, deferred tax assets realization, pension and post‐employment benefit discount rates, and goodwill and indefinite‐lived intangible assets impairment—are regularly tested and adjusted to reflect current market conditions, with any resulting non‐cash charges, such as the shave care goodwill and intangible impairment, recognized to reconstitute book values in line with revised cash flow projections and to signal organizational commitment to performance maintenance and the long‐term integrity of its operating units. This comprehensive suite of risk mitigation, structural reconfiguration, and adaptive strategies supports the Company’s ability to absorb strain, reconfigure operations in response to disruptions and maintain core functioning and growth trajectories under nominal, extreme or exceptional scenarios.

NVIDIA’s disclosures reflect multiple practices and mechanisms that support its capacity to absorb strain and maintain performance under challenging conditions. In response to market volatility and sudden decreases in demand, the company “charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory,” and recognizes sales of previously written-off components, actions that mitigate risk and preserve gross margin. As a fabless semiconductor company, NVIDIA “must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand” and “adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions,” illustrating adaptive resource deployment and operational flexibility. The firm’s investment policy “requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain limits on our portfolio duration,” thereby securing financial resources to support business continuity. As of January 26, 2020, NVIDIA held $10.90 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities—an increase of $3.48 billion from the prior year—reflecting strong operating cash flows driven by inventory reductions and underscoring the company’s liquidity to meet operating requirements and pursue strategic transactions such as the proposed Mellanox acquisition. NVIDIA also maintains undrawn credit and commercial paper facilities up to $1 billion, providing additional financial flexibility. Governance and oversight of critical accounting policies and goodwill impairment assessments by the audit committee reinforce informed decision-making under uncertainty, while capital return programs and dividend policies balance stakeholder interests with sustaining long-term organizational health and resilience amid external pressures such as the novel coronavirus-related shutdowns and regulatory challenges.

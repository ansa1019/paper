Management’s discussion and analysis describes how the Company has absorbed strain and preserved performance under challenging conditions by completing and integrating significant acquisitions such as BTG plc’s interventional medicine business into its peripheral interventions division, deploying process improvement programs and ongoing cost-optimization initiatives to drive manufacturing cost reductions, and reporting operational net sales growth metrics that exclude the 180-basis-point headwind from foreign currency fluctuations in order to assess underlying performance.  The Company emphasizes its ability to fund operations, invest in infrastructure in 20 emerging markets, meet debt service obligations, and pursue strategic growth initiatives by maintaining $217 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, investing excess cash in diversified short-term instruments, utilizing a $2.750 billion commercial paper program backed by a revolving credit facility, entering term-loan facilities to refinance bridge financing and fund the BTG acquisition, and completing €900 million and $4.3 billion senior note offerings, all of which contribute to business continuity and liquidity resilience.  Adaptation to regulatory change is illustrated by a planned $150 million of incremental EU MDR compliance expenditures, recorded outside ordinary course regulatory costs, and by the use of net investment and non-designated forward currency hedges—recognizing a $323 million loss in other, net—to mitigate currency and acquisition price risks.  The Company also separates litigation-related net charges and reserves for product liability and IP matters from SG&A to enable transparent risk assessment and collateral learning, records intangible asset impairment charges of $105 million and evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived asset recoverability through annual fair-value assessments that consider market size, growth rates, reimbursement pressures, and cost-saving programs, and periodically revises deferred revenue, sales-return allowances, royalty obligations, and contingent consideration liabilities based on historical trends and estimated milestones.  Finally, the establishment of controls and escalation procedures for cybersecurity incidents and the formal governance framework for legal contingencies and tax uncertainties demonstrate a systemic perspective and crisis management capability designed to ensure the maintenance of system integrity, strategic flexibility, and positive adjustment under internal and external disturbances.

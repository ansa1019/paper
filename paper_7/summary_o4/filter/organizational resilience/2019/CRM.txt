In response to the novel coronavirus outbreak, we have shifted certain customer events to virtual-only experiences and may similarly alter, postpone or cancel additional customer, employee or industry events as circumstances warrant, and we continue to assess the duration and spread of the outbreak and its impact on our customers, sales cycles, events and vendors, highlighting our capacity to adjust operations under uncertain external pressures. We maintain a subscription-based business model with strong cash provided by operations and a credit facility that supports our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs, enabling continuity of operations despite market volatility and foreign currency fluctuations, which negatively impacted our revenues but are expected to continue. We continue to invest for future growth by focusing on multi-cloud adoption, growing enterprise and international relationships and strengthening our ecosystem of partners and ISVs, regularly evaluating acquisitions or investment opportunities through a disciplined and thoughtful acquisition process and reinvesting significant incremental revenue to expand our service offerings, reflecting our ability to reconfigure resources and adapt our strategy in response to changing market conditions. To scale our operations and continuously evolve our security measures, we have increased headcount by 30 percent in cost of revenues roles, 54 percent in research and development, and 36 percent in marketing and sales since fiscal 2019, and continue to invest additional resources in data center capacity, internal systems and technology enhancements. We adopted new lease accounting standards at the beginning of fiscal 2020 and prospectively adopted updates to financial instruments in fiscal 2019, demonstrating our systemic perspective and commitment to preserving the integrity and comparability of our financial reporting processes. Our remaining performance obligation of $30.8 billion, which represents contracted revenue not yet recognized and is influenced by seasonality, timing of renewals, average contract terms, currency exchange rates and new business growth, along with our management of attrition rates and billings patterns, underscores our operational flexibility and ability to maintain and forecast revenue under varying conditions. We believe that our existing resources—cash, marketable securities, operating cash flow and access to debt financing—as well as unbilled contracted amounts, position us to absorb strain and preserve functioning in the face of both nominal and extreme pressures, while our continuous investments in acquisitions such as Tableau, MuleSoft, Clicksoftware and Vlocity and strategic equity investments support our transformation and reconfiguration toward future growth and resilience. These measures embody our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning, consistent with maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

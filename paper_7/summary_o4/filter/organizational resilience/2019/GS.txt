Goldman Sachs discloses that it maintains a comprehensive business continuity plan and information security program, together with contingency funding and capital plans, designed to ensure operational continuity and the “maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” by pre-funding projected cash and collateral needs, holding global core liquid assets and diversified funding sources, and retaining capital buffers to absorb market shocks; it operates under an enterprise risk management framework that defines risk appetite, assigns responsibility through three lines of defense and a series of governance committees, and deploys firmwide stress testing—including 30-day and intraday liquidity models, longer-term stress and resolution scenarios, reverse stress tests and broad scenario analyses of sovereign defaults—to assess and mitigate liquidity, market, credit, operational and model risks; it imposes firmwide, business and product limits and netting and collateral requirements to manage exposures, employs independent valuation adjustments and credit reviews to preserve integrity of its derivatives and lending activities, and conducts annual self-assessments, independent model validations and ongoing operational risk and vendor risk reviews to reconfigure resources, realign strategies and uphold organizational health, systemic resilience and performance maintenance even under extreme or exceptional circumstances.

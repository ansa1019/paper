In 2019, operating fundamentals remained strong for our owned-and-managed portfolio, with occupancies of 96.5% reflecting sustained performance under market pressures and a strategic focus on rental rate growth; during the year we formed multiple co-investment ventures in Brazil and China, contributed existing asset portfolios in exchange for equity interests and generated net proceeds of $2.4 billion—actions that reconfigured our investment structure, absorbed financial strain and preserved or improved functioning despite market adversity; at December 31, 2019, we maintained $3.7 billion of available borrowing capacity under credit facilities and total liquidity of $4.8 billion, including unrestricted cash balances, supported by diversified debt issuances across currencies and maturities, unsecured Japanese yen term loans and senior notes in euros, and a natural hedge through currency-matched borrowings to mitigate foreign exchange risk; our financing activities—redemption of senior notes, private placements and new issuances—lengthened maturities, reduced effective interest rates and reinforced business continuity, while disciplined risk management included monitoring credit ratings, maintaining covenant compliance, using derivative instruments for undesignated hedge purposes, remeasuring unhedged debt and rigorously assessing the recoverability of long-lived assets under adverse conditions; we consider our ability to generate cash from operating activities, strategic capital revenues, distributions from unconsolidated entities, property contributions and dispositions, and borrowing capacity to be adequate to meet anticipated future development, acquisition, operating, debt service, dividend and distribution requirements, thereby aligning resource allocation, strategic foresight and adaptability with our primary objectives under varying economic and environmental perturbations and supporting the maintenance of integrity and performance under challenging conditions.

These forward‚Äêlooking statements reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs for future performance and underscore our continuous risk assessment and strategic foresight under variable market conditions. In 2019, we recorded a $5.0 billion FTC settlement expense in the first six months of the year, illustrating our crisis management process and capacity to absorb organizational strain. We anticipate that additional investments in our data center capacity, network infrastructure, and office facilities, as well as scaling our headcount to support our growth, will continue to drive expense growth in 2020, demonstrating resource allocation and operational flexibility essential for business continuity. Our calculations of daily and monthly active people rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique users, reflecting a systemic perspective and knowledge management approach to preserve performance metrics under uncertainty. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, and we record provisions for liabilities when we believe that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, evidencing formal risk mitigation strategies. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable, thereby enabling partial maintenance of system integrity under potential disturbances. Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations, and we believe that our available funds, credit facility, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future, underpinning strategic resilience. Contractual commitments for operating leases, network infrastructure, and energy agreements provide proactive resource planning, with ultimate spend varying based on market prices or actual volume, and our share repurchase program authorizes targeted capital deployment without an expiration date, further underlining our capability to reconfigure financial resources and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

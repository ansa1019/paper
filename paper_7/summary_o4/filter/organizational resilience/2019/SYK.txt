Our goal is to achieve sales growth at the high end of the medtech industry and maintain our long-term capital allocation strategy that prioritizes acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases. We continued this strategy by investing $802 million in acquisitions, paying $778 million in dividends and using $307 million for share repurchases, and when we issued €2.4 billion of senior unsecured notes we announced our intention to suspend our share repurchase program in 2020 and 2021, dynamically reconfiguring our financial priorities to preserve liquidity. We believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates, and operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures; excess cash is used first to fund acquisitions to complement our portfolio and we supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund our activities as necessary. Our overall cash position reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations, and we maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans and overall cost of capital. We anticipate supporting our short-term liquidity and operating needs from cash from operations, commercial paper and existing credit lines, and we operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax, policy and regulatory environments, evaluating our tax positions and establishing liabilities in accordance with guidance on uncertainty in income taxes and adjusting them as facts and circumstances change, believing that the ultimate outcomes are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory based on estimates regarding future recoverability and historical experience, and we are involved in various legal proceedings for which we record liabilities representing management’s best estimate of probable loss, including $192 million of recall charges in 2019 primarily due to previously disclosed voluntary recalls, recognizing that actual outcomes could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We review long-lived assets and goodwill annually for impairment indicators based on updated projections, qualitative factors and discounted cash flow analyses and did not recognize any impairment charges in the periods presented, as fair values exceeded recorded values. Our research, development and engineering spending is supported by projects to develop new products, investments in new technologies and recent acquisitions, while our operating expense improvement initiatives leverage higher sales volumes to partially offset the leverage from acquisitions. Consolidated net sales increased 9.4% as reported and 10.7% in constant currency in 2019, despite a 1.3% negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates, and, excluding the 2.6% impact of acquisitions, net sales in constant currency increased by 9.0% from increased unit volume partially offset by 0.9% due to lower prices.

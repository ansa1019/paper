Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities and manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis, with minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day activities of the operating businesses, while our senior corporate management team retains responsibility for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and chief executive selection, thereby fostering resource flexibility and adaptive strategic deployment. Beginning in 2018, our periodic net earnings include changes in unrealized gains and losses on our investments in equity securities; these gains and losses have been very significant given the size of our holdings and the inherent volatility in securities prices, producing extraordinary volatility in our reported net earnings, yet we believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses, and generally, we consider pre-tax catastrophe losses in excess of $100 million from a current year event as significant, having incurred estimated pre-tax losses of approximately $1.0 billion in 2019 from significant catastrophe events. In our railroad business, earnings in 2019 benefitted from ongoing operating cost control initiatives and a curtailment gain related to an amendment to defined benefit retirement plans, partly offset by lower freight volumes and incremental costs associated with the persistent flooding conditions and severe winter weather in the first half of the year; all key routes impacted by flooding resumed service by the third quarter. Operating results of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in 2019 were mixed, negatively affected by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation attributable to a stronger U.S. dollar, international trade tensions and U.S. trade tariffs, and specific events such as the fire at Lubrizol’s Rouen, France, manufacturing, blending and storage facility on September 26, 2019, which suspended operations and contributed to additive volume declines until partial restart in December 2019; we implement measures and intend to implement additional measures to address manufacturing inefficiencies and improve operations. Our utilities and energy businesses produce regulatory adaptations by passing the benefits of lower income tax expense attributable to statutory rate reductions to customers through various mechanisms, reflecting systemic resilience to legislative changes. Retail, service and distribution segments navigate intensely competitive environments by diversifying product offerings, adjusting operating expense structures and leveraging volume and pricing initiatives to maintain performance under pressure. Strategic debt issuance, refinancing and a share repurchase program — subject to maintaining a consolidated cash threshold — underline our commitment to redundant liquidity, ensuring financial strength to absorb strain, reconfigure trajectories toward the future and emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

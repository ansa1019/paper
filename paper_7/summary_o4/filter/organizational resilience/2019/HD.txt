In fiscal 2019, we generated $13.7 billion of cash flow from operations, driven by net earnings of $11.2 billion and non-cash adjustments for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and deferred income taxes, while managing working capital outflows related to inventory purchases and receivables; these funds, together with cash on hand, were used to pay $6.0 billion of dividends, fund $7.0 billion for share repurchases, repay $365 million of net short-term borrowings, fund $2.7 billion in capital expenditures and retire $1.0 billion of senior notes, and at February 2, 2020 we held $2.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which $1.8 billion was held by foreign subsidiaries.  We maintain access to $3.0 billion of commercial paper programs supported by backup credit facilities and periodically issue senior notes and use derivative instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate exposures; at February 2, 2020 we were in compliance with all covenant requirements, and we expect our current cash position, operating cash flow, funds available under credit facilities and access to capital markets to be sufficient to support operating requirements, dividend payments, capital expenditures of approximately $2.8 billion in fiscal 2020 and required debt payments through the next several fiscal years.  In response to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which has created uncertainty and adverse impacts on our supply chain, operations and customer demand, we have reduced store operating hours, expanded paid time off for associates, shifted certain support operations to remote or virtual environments, implemented foot-traffic management measures, ceased or delayed non-life-sustaining services in certain jurisdictions and suspended our share repurchase program; we continue to actively monitor the situation, may take further actions as required or in the best interests of our associates, customers, suppliers, vendors and shareholders, and while we expect the pandemic to affect our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact at this time.  We also evaluate our long-lived assets quarterly for indicators of impairment—such as current and historic losses, planned relocations or closures—and assess recoverability by comparing undiscounted projected cash flows, based on assumptions about future sales, margins, market competition and inflation, to carrying values, and we measure any impairment against fair value estimates derived from market appraisals and potential sublease income.  Inventory is valued under the retail inventory method using cost-to-retail ratios adjusted for prevailing market conditions, including markups, markdowns and shrink estimates based on physical counts and store-specific trends, to approximate the lower of cost or market; vendor allowances for volume rebates and co-op advertising are accrued as earned and reduce inventory costs or SG&A upon sale or reimbursement.  We have established self-insurance liabilities for general liability, workers’ compensation, employee medical and automobile claims based on historical and actuarial estimates; we record the benefits of uncertain tax positions only when it is more likely than not such positions will be sustained; and we recognize that these resources, controls and processes support our ability to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning, adapt to evolving conditions and maintain continuity under internal or external variations and disturbances.

Our strategy includes integrated activities intended to maintain and strengthen our competitive position in the industry, and during 2019 we advanced our innovative pipeline, launched branded biosimilar programs, built our global geographic reach and expanded our next-generation manufacturing capabilities, while returning capital to shareholders. We intend to continue to invest in our business while returning capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases, reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. Our long-term success depends, to a great extent, on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies; we must develop new products to achieve revenue growth and to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity or when competing products are launched. During the year we delivered strong financial results while facing competition from biosimilars and generics, rising healthcare costs and economic conditions that continue to pose challenges, including continued pressure by third-party payers to reduce healthcare expenditures, significant pricing pressures and other cost-containment measures. We have global access to our $8.9 billion balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and the primary objective of our investment portfolio is to maintain safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Operating cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds, and we believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements, our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. To manage interest rate and foreign currency exchange-rate risk, we entered into interest rate swap contracts and cross-currency swap contracts that qualify and are designated as fair value and cash flow hedges, respectively, and we amended and restated our $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program, under which no amounts were outstanding as of December 31, 2019. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict, and we caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecasted.

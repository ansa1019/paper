Management describes a range of strategic and operational measures undertaken to absorb strain and preserve performance in the face of internal and external disturbances, including expanding collaboration, cooperation and interdependency among its brands by sharing resources and technological innovations, co-developing new services and coordinating activities in key markets; dynamically allocating performance marketing spend based on growth and profitability objectives and expected returns on investment; diversifying its transactional model by increasingly processing travel transactions on a merchant basis to offer secure and flexible payment terms; entering into derivative instruments to minimize short-term foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and employing constant-currency reporting to assess underlying results; and investing in marketing, technology and personnel to improve consumer experience and long-term operating results, even when such expenditures place near-term pressure on operating margins.  The company continues to build a “connected trip” offering and pursue strategic acquisitions to broaden its services and generate competitive advantage, while acknowledging that unpredictable macro-economic events—such as the coronavirus outbreak, geopolitical tensions, extreme weather, pandemics and evolving tax and regulatory regimes—have had and may continue to have significant negative impacts on travel demand, cancellations, average daily rates and overall financial performance.  Management also emphasizes its seasonality planning, risk management processes and hedging strategies, and cautions that intense competition, rapid technological change and regulatory scrutiny require ongoing adaptation, resource reconfiguration and resilience strategies to maintain integrity and functioning under challenging conditions.

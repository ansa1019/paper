Philip Morris International’s description of leading a transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smoke-free future through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation underscores the firm’s focus on anticipating and adapting to disruptive change and maintaining business continuity. The management of six operating segments and the active reconfiguration of product mix, pricing strategies and geographic focus—in particular the favorable pricing variances in Germany, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines and Turkey, and heated tobacco unit volume growth in the EU, Russia and Japan, partially offset by areas of unfavorable volume/mix—reflects operational flexibility and resource redeployment to preserve performance under varying market pressures and currency fluctuations. Strategic decisions to optimize the global manufacturing infrastructure, including asset impairment and exit costs of $422 million and plant closures in Berlin, Argentina, Colombia and Pakistan, as well as the pre-tax charges related to asset impairments, litigation-related expenses and the deconsolidation of RBH under Canada’s CCAA process—which permitted continued operations with minimal disruption to customers, suppliers and employees—illustrate the company’s resilience in restructuring its affairs in response to internal and external adversities. Further, PMI’s ongoing efforts to optimize its capital structure—reflected in the use of existing cash to repay $6.5 billion of long-term debt following the U.S. tax reforms—and the declaratory flexibility of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions underscore the firm’s systemic capacity to absorb strain, reconfigure financial resources and sustain its integrity and performance in nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

Chubb’s business model emphasizes diversification of products and geographies, a substantial capital base supported by underwriting and investment income, and disciplined risk management—including multi-layered reinsurance protection, credit facilities, and highly liquid investments—to maintain stability and liquidity under unforeseen claims and market perturbations. The company actively monitors its catastrophe risk accumulation through probable maximum loss modeling, sets risk limits, purchases catastrophe reinsurance and bonds, and employs underwriting guidelines, client guarantee design, annual and aggregate claim limits, and derivative hedging strategies in its variable annuity guarantee program to mitigate market and policyholder behavior risks. Operational resilience is bolstered by a profit-center corporate structure granting senior teams autonomy to make timely underwriting and product decisions, supported by routine analytical reviews, underwriting and claims audits, dedicated asset portfolios duration-matched to liabilities and notional cash-pooling programs to optimize cash management across currencies. In addition, Chubb maintains strategic access to capital markets and credit facilities, manages regulatory and rating-agency requirements for dividend distributions and capital adequacy, and continually refines its risk transfer protocols to ensure the ability to absorb strain, preserve performance, and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

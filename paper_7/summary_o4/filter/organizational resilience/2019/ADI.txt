In fiscal 2019, the Company recorded special charges of $88.1 million under a repositioning action to realign its global workforce skill set with its long-term strategic plan and $7.6 million related to the consolidation and planned closure of certain wafer fabrication and test facilities, actions which are expected to yield net annualized cash savings of approximately $48 million and $60 million, respectively, through the transfer of production to other internal facilities, external foundries and outsourced partners; it maintains hundreds of R&D projects and emphasizes continued investment in innovative technologies and processes to sustain product leadership, enable service innovation and support future growth; its principal source of liquidity comprised $648.3 million of cash and cash equivalents held in high-quality, short-term investments diversified across jurisdictions with rigorous counterparty monitoring, supplemented by a $1.25 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in 2024 and a $1.25 billion three-year term loan maturing in 2022, which the Company believes, together with expected cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and dividend payments for at least the next twelve months; the board-authorized share repurchase program remains in place with $2.1 billion available for future buybacks; and the Company employs interest rate derivatives to hedge floating-rate debt—where a 100 basis point change in interest rates would alter annual interest expense by approximately $9.3 million—and forward foreign currency contracts to mitigate non-U.S. dollar exposures, all consistent with its objective to absorb financial and operational strain, preserve or improve functioning under internal or external variations and maintain operational flexibility and resilience under challenging conditions.

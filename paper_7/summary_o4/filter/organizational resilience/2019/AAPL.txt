The company’s management and Board of Directors have undertaken a range of measures that support the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including sustaining substantial cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, supported by commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, to satisfy working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements over the next 12 months; an investment policy that limits credit exposure to highly rated, investment-grade securities to minimize principal loss; the use of unsecured commercial paper for general corporate purposes and the authorization to repurchase up to $175 billion of common stock and to raise dividends annually, thereby preserving financial flexibility and resource deployment capacity; engagement of outsourcing partners under long-term purchase commitments and related prepayments to secure inventory supply, along with accruals for cancellation fees and periodic reviews of recoverable manufacturing-related assets to maintain supply-chain continuity and operational flexibility; active use of interest rate swaps and foreign currency swaps to manage interest rate and currency risks on outstanding notes, and the geographic segmentation of business operations to align with unique regional market dynamics and mitigate foreign-currency volatility; a structured plan to adopt new accounting standards via modified retrospective transition methods with anticipated immaterial impacts, reflecting preparedness for regulatory and systemic changes; and senior management’s ongoing judgment-based estimation process—anchored in historical experience and reviewed with the Audit and Finance Committee—for critical accounting policies such as revenue recognition, asset valuation, warranty accruals, income tax provisions and contingencies, which collectively preserve system integrity, support adaptive decision-making under uncertainty and reinforce the firm’s ability to absorb strain while preserving or improving its functioning.

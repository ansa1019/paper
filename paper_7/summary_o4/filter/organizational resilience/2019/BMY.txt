Bristol-Myers Squibb has undertaken a series of operational transformations and financial strategies that enhance its organizational resilience, including evolving its operating model to streamline commercialization, research and development and manufacturing networks, maintaining disciplined marketing, selling and administrative expenses to enable strategic, financial and operational flexibility, and constructing a new large-scale biologics facility to bolster capacity for its growing biologics portfolio. In response to the sale of its Anagni manufacturing plant, the company built channel inventory in Gulf countries to mitigate the risk of product supply disruption, while a company-wide policy with governance escalation and regular monitoring procedures was implemented to comply with an SEC consent order limiting direct customer sales to expected demand. The integration of the Celgene transaction into commercial and R&D areas is progressing to realize $2.5 billion of synergies through cost savings and avoidance across general and administrative, manufacturing, R&D, procurement and information technology infrastructure. Financial resilience is further maintained through a $5 billion unsecured commercial paper program supported by revolving credit facilities, continuous evaluation of capital structure—including debt and equity repurchases, termination of interest rate swaps and potential issuance of new debt—and liquidity planning that considers existing cash, marketable securities, operational cash flows and, if required, additional debt issuance. The company leverages alliance collaborations and flexible cost-sharing arrangements to manage risk, uses third-party data alongside internal processes to estimate channel inventories where direct information is limited, monitors macroeconomic and geopolitical developments such as Brexit and the novel coronavirus outbreak for potential impacts on liquidity and operations, and supports long-term sustainability of its pipeline through combined internal and external innovation, milestone-driven R&D investments and adaptive resource allocation to its highest-priority therapeutic and commercial opportunities.

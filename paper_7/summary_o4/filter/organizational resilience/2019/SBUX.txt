In fiscal 2019, Starbucks continued streamlining operations initiated in fiscal 2017 by converting Thailand, France and the Netherlands markets to fully licensed models and combining reporting segments to better reflect these reconfigurations, demonstrating the company’s capacity to reconstitute and reconfigure its operational structure in response to strategic imperatives and external pressures. The company realigned segment reporting and reclassified costs, including occupancy expense from cost of sales to store operating expenses, to preserve the integrity of its financial metrics under a changing operating model. Starbucks actively manages its cash and investments—$3.0 billion in cash and investments at September 29, 2019—to fund operating needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and shareholder returns, and believes that future cash flows combined with its leverage capacity will support capital requirements and resilience against market variations. Risk mitigation practices include hedging commodity price risk via fixed‐price and price‐to‐be‐fixed supply contracts and financial derivatives to stabilize green coffee and dairy costs, using derivative instruments to reduce foreign currency volatility in intercompany transactions and translation exposure, and employing interest rate swaps to manage the cash flow variability of anticipated debt issuances and existing fixed-rate debt. Starbucks maintains committed credit facilities and a commercial paper program to ensure liquidity for working capital and strategic purposes, and holds a diversified available-for-sale securities portfolio to preserve capital and system integrity. The company’s capital allocation strategy—comprising accelerated share repurchase agreements, regular open market repurchases, dividend payments and sustainable debt issuances—reflects its proactive measures to reconfigure resource deployment, maintain performance under pressure and support long-term strategic objectives. Ongoing impairment analyses of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets and the recognition of deferred tax assets rely on internal projections of revenue growth, operating expenses and market multiples, underscoring a systemic perspective and reflexive adjustment process to preserve enterprise value and operational flexibility under varying economic conditions.

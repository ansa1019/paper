Our operations and reporting describe an approach to maintaining continuity and adaptability under variable and challenging conditions by incorporating data backup and disaster recovery services into subscription offerings and by pricing that includes multiple instances, hosting and support services and updates during the subscription term while enabling work to flow naturally across disparate departments, systems and processes. We continue to invest in the development of our services, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth, and we anticipate our current cash and cash equivalents balance and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs—including repayment of our 2022 notes, expansion of data centers, lease obligations, headcount growth expenditures and acquisitions of property and equipment, intangible assets and office facilities—for at least the next twelve months, while retaining the flexibility to seek additional equity or debt financing if required. To mitigate our risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, we enter into foreign currency derivative contracts with maturities of twelve months or less to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities, recognizing that such hedges may reduce, but cannot entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements. Our billing practices accommodate customer requests for durations other than the typical annual term, and our revenue recognition policies allocate transaction price on a relative standalone selling price basis to distinct performance obligations—recognizing cloud-based subscription revenues ratably over the subscription term and software revenue upfront upon delivery for self-hosted offerings—practices that support the organization’s ability to preserve or improve functioning under variable contractual and economic pressures. We have historically managed seasonality by restating our metrics on a comparable basis and planning for our highest billings and sequential RPO growth in the fourth fiscal quarter, while acknowledging that past patterns may not reliably predict future performance. Ongoing increases in headcount, data center operations, research and development, sales and marketing and related amortization of deferred commissions reflect deliberate resource allocation, operational flexibility and future orientation. We maintain a full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets and recognized a $574.2 million income tax benefit from the release of the valuation allowance on our Irish deferred tax assets, applying significant judgment in assessing positive and negative evidence and prudent tax planning strategies. Our critical accounting processes for business combinations, deferred commissions and uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and are designed to uphold system integrity and performance despite inherent uncertainties and external perturbations.

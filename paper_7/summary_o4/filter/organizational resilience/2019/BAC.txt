Throughout its Management Discussion and Analysis, the Corporation underscores its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adversity by employing a formal risk management framework, driven by an annual strategic and capital planning process aligned with an approved risk appetite statement. Executive management and the Board of Directors oversee a comprehensive identify, measure, monitor and control process for strategic, credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance and reputational risks, supported by capital scenario management, historical and hypothetical stress testing and regular ICAAP assessments. The Corporation maintains global liquidity sources of high-quality unencumbered assets, diversified funding across deposits, secured and unsecured markets, and has developed contingency funding plans and a capital and liquidity recovery plan that detail escalation procedures—ranging from asset sales and de-risking strategies to debt issuances and business divestitures—to respond to a range of economic or market stress scenarios. Subsidiary resolution plans, legal entity funding arrangements and intraday liquidity protocols further reinforce operational continuity in extreme conditions. Asset and Liability Management uses securities and interest rate, foreign exchange and mortgage pipeline hedges to mitigate interest rate and foreign exchange risk, support net interest income and offset capital volatility. Credit risk management combines robust underwriting, statistical modeling, concentration limits, proactive loan modifications for customers in financial distress and purchased credit protection to mitigate potential losses. Independent risk management and corporate audit functions ensure adherence to policies, validation of models and effectiveness of controls, while a corporate code of conduct links employee performance and compensation to risk objectives. Information security, business continuity measures and periodic evaluations of operational, regulatory and legal risks—such as preparations for the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU—round out the Corporation’s resilience mechanisms that enable it to function and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

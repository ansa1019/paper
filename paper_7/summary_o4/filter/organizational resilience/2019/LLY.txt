The Management’s Discussion and Analysis describes a series of strategic and operational measures that collectively support the company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite internal or external variations, pressures and uncertainties.  Management emphasizes forward-looking statements that recognize various risks and uncertainties, continuous monitoring of economic, regulatory and competitive environments, and the use of hedging and other risk management techniques to limit the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and interest-rate changes on earnings and cash flows.  During 2019, the Company reconfigured its business by completing the disposition of its remaining 80.2 percent ownership of Elanco Animal Health, closing and selling a U.K. research and development facility, and acquiring Loxo and Dermira to bolster its pipeline, thereby reallocating resources and reinforcing operational flexibility.  The Company’s long-term success is said to depend on its ability to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products through a diversified portfolio of approximately 45 potential new drugs in human testing or under regulatory review, with the view that a delay or termination of any single project will not necessarily cause a significant change in total R&D spending.  Liquidity and financing strategies—comprising cash, investments, unused committed credit facilities and access to commercial paper markets—are maintained to ensure operational continuity and support business continuity under challenging conditions.  Formal guidance for 2020, including projected revenue growth, EPS and gross margin targets, illustrates the use of strategic planning, future orientation and systematic risk assessment to respond effectively to environmental disruptions, transform the organization and emerge stronger amid volatility.

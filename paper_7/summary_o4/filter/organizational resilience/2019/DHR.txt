Danaher’s MD&A outlines a range of strategic resources, processes and risk-management mechanisms that underlie its ability to absorb strain and preserve performance under internal or external pressures. The Company highlights that its geographic and industry diversity, and the breadth of its products, software and services, help limit the impact of any single market or economy on consolidated operating results, and that individual businesses monitor competitor and customer sales to gauge relative performance and future outlook. To address rapid technological development and evolving customer needs, Danaher is making significant investments, both organically and through acquisitions such as the GE Biopharma transaction, to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing capabilities—expanding geographic and product-line diversity to improve responsiveness and operational efficiency. The Company’s broad-based activities and ongoing productivity-improvement initiatives support cost savings and mitigate volatility, while capital expenditures are targeted at increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development and upgrading information-technology systems. To manage currency and interest-rate risk, Danaher periodically employs derivative instruments—including cross-currency swaps to hedge net investments in foreign operations and interest-rate swaps to stabilize cash flows associated with debt financing. In response to geopolitical uncertainties such as Brexit and public-health threats such as the coronavirus, the Company continues to monitor developments, plan for potential impacts, and, for example, has increased inventory levels in the UK to mitigate import-disruption risks. Danaher assesses liquidity through its ability to generate substantial operating cash flows and maintains credit facilities and the capacity to issue debt or equity as needed to fund acquisitions, service obligations and capital needs, thus preserving system integrity and maintaining performance in the face of environmental turbulence.

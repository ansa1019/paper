We offer choice and flexibility to our customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customersâ€™ needs and, to address customer demand and enable customer choice, have introduced programs for customers to pivot their applications and infrastructure licenses and the related license support to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing workloads.  Providing choice and flexibility to our customers as to when and how they deploy our applications and infrastructure technologies is an important element of our corporate strategy, and our Oracle Cloud services deliver certain of our applications and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we develop, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, host, manage, upgrade and support, thereby preserving system integrity and performance under varying conditions.  We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services, and our hardware support offerings provide customers with unspecified software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products.  Our services business helps customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies through consulting, advanced customer support and education services, leveraging extensive experience, broad sets of intellectual property and best practices.  Restructuring expenses resulted from the execution of management-approved restructuring plans that were generally developed to improve our cost structure and/or operations, often in conjunction with our acquisition integration strategies, and our selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy, in which we estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward.  We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements and that we could fund our future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities, reflecting a systemic perspective on preserving operational flexibility and resilience under evolving economic and business conditions.

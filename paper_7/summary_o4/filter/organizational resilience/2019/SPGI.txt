The company’s strategic acquisitions—such as the January 2020 purchase of the ESG ratings business from RobecoSAM and the April 2018 acquisition of Kensho Technologies—are intended to allocate and reconfigure resources, enhance service innovation and technological capabilities, and strengthen core analytical and data-driven functions. Through the launch of its “Powering the Markets of the Future” framework, management emphasizes forward-looking business strategy, resource deployment toward foundational capability enhancements, evolving core businesses and growth via adjacencies, thereby improving operational flexibility and future orientation. The disciplined acquisition, investment and partnership approach, combined with initiatives to standardize and simplify technology, reduce cybersecurity risk, and advance a strong risk, internal control and compliance environment, supports both business continuity and system integrity under regulatory and market pressures. By returning $5.4 billion of capital to shareholders, maintaining a robust liquidity position—including $2.9 billion in cash, a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility and sustained free cash flow—and divesting non-core assets such as RigData and SPIAS, the company demonstrates strategic resilience through resource reconfiguration, recapitalization and focus on higher-return operations. In response to regulatory changes, including MiFID II, the EU Benchmark Regulation and evolving oversight of credit rating agencies, the company has implemented internal controls, updated methodologies and engaged in organizational realignment to mitigate legal and compliance risks, thereby preserving its performance and integrity in the face of external disturbances. Moreover, the purchase of a $370 million group annuity contract to assume pension obligations reflects proactive risk mitigation to preserve financial resources and reduce mortality and investment volatility. These combined strategic tools and operational adjustments illustrate the organization’s ability to absorb strain, reconfigure trajectories, and maintain or improve functioning amid evolving market, regulatory and technological challenges.

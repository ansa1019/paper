In an environment of complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures, a significant component of our strategy is to focus on program execution by improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our customers at affordable prices, thereby enhancing operational flexibility and business continuity. Recognizing that our customers are resource constrained, we endeavor to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner with a focus on adjacent markets close to our core capabilities, as well as growing our international sales and continuing to focus on affordability initiatives, while innovating and investing in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements and in our people so that we have the technical skills necessary to succeed. Through portfolio shaping activities, we continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio by independent research and development and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities, selectively pursuing acquisitions at attractive valuations to expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies, and exploring the divestiture of businesses that no longer meet our needs or strategy. To mitigate external pressures and ensure continuity of the F-35 program following Turkeyâ€™s suspension, we are working closely with the DoD to identify and engage alternate suppliers for component parts, re-establish replacement capacity, monitor sanctions risks, and adapt our supply chain so that production is not impacted. We routinely monitor and adjust our contract estimates, recognizing risk retirements and profit booking rate adjustments as conditions improve or deteriorate, and record provisions for performance issues on complex programs to maintain system integrity and performance under challenging conditions. Our cash deployment strategy is balanced to enhance stockholder value and position us to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise, investing in capital expenditures, independent research and development, and selective acquisitions, while returning cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases and actively managing our debt levels, interest rates and pension obligations. We have frozen our defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees, completed buy-out and buy-in annuity contracts to transfer pension obligations and manage volatility, and maintain sufficient funded status and prepayment credits to support customer contract performance. We employ derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency and interest rate exposures, ensuring cash flow stability, and continually evaluate and record environmental remediation liabilities and associated recoveries under U.S. government regulations, thereby preserving organizational resilience and continuity of operations in the presence of internal and external variations and disturbances.

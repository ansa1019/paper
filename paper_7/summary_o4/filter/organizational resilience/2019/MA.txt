Mastercard, a global payments technology company, operates a multi-rail network that switches, clears and settles payment transactions and delivers related products and services—including batch and real-time ACH payments and cyber and intelligence offerings—to provide operational flexibility and ensure business continuity under varying conditions. The company sustains liquidity and funds its global operations, credit and settlement exposure, capital expenditures and potential obligations through net cash flows from operations, cash and investment securities balances, a $6 billion committed revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program designed to provide liquidity in the event of customer settlement failures or other disruptions. It manages foreign currency translational and transactional exposures and records gains and losses on derivative contracts to mitigate currency fluctuations’ impact on gross dollar and euro volumes, domestic assessments and rebates. In 2017, in response to restrictive exchange controls in Venezuela, Mastercard transitioned to the cost method of accounting for its local subsidiaries while continuing to serve issuers, acquirers, merchants and account holders, exemplifying adaptation and continuity under regulatory adversity. The firm assesses its underlying operations and compares performance on a non-GAAP, currency-neutral basis to inform strategic planning, resource allocation and performance-based compensation, and it invests in strategic initiatives and acquisitions—totaling $1.5 billion in 2019—while executing share repurchases and dividend programs to preserve financial strength and strategic agility. By guaranteeing transaction settlement, proactively managing litigation and tax contingencies, and aligning its risk management framework with evolving accounting guidance and market dynamics, Mastercard seeks to absorb strain, preserve system integrity and maintain positive performance adjustment when confronted with internal and external pressures.

The company’s organizational resilience is reflected in its global risk, strategy and people platform that combines risk advice, risk transfer and risk control and mitigation solutions through its two operating segments—risk and insurance services and consulting—thereby preserving functional performance under internal and external pressures and enabling positive adjustment in challenging conditions.  The integration of the Jardine Lloyd Thompson acquisition illustrates the firm’s ability to absorb strain and reconfigure resources through comprehensive integration and restructuring plans—incurring severance, real estate rationalization, technology and consulting costs, identifying further efficiency opportunities, and targeting run-rate savings of at least $350 million—to maintain operational continuity and enhance long-term performance.  Liquidity and capital resources management, including regular repatriation of non-U.S. earnings, strategic use of dividends, bridge and senior note financing, and a $1.5 billion commercial paper program, demonstrates the firm’s capacity to redeploy financial resources in response to environmental disturbances and regulatory changes such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  The disciplined hedging program—including foreign exchange contracts to manage GBP/USD exposure, treasury locks to mitigate interest rate risk, and the designation of €1.1 billion of euro-denominated senior notes as a net investment hedge—further underscores its dynamic capabilities in risk assessment and mitigation.  Stable cash generation of $2.4 billion from operations, together with proactive pension funding strategies designed to maintain at least an 80% funded status under ERISA and international statutory requirements, illustrate the firm’s systemic perspective on resilience, balancing resource generation, allocation and preservation of organizational health amidst market volatility and disruptive change.

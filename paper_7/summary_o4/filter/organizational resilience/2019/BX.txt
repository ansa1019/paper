Blackstoneâ€™s management acknowledges that its businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic environments globally and that 2019 was characterized by rising markets and continued economic expansion despite uncertainty related to trade disputes, geopolitical risks and yield-curve inversions. Fixed income markets saw dovish monetary policy drive yields lower while volatility moderated, yet the firm remained agile, deploying a record $22.5 billion of capital in real estate, $26.6 billion in private equity and $10.2 billion in credit to drive transformation and generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. Blackstone highlights the rapid development and fluidity of the novel coronavirus outbreak, noting its disruption of global travel and supply chains, its adverse impact on transportation, hospitality and entertainment sectors and the unpredictability of its ultimate effect on economic and market conditions, which could trigger a period of global slowdown. The firm manages its business using key operating metrics and a fee-structured, third-party capital model that provides operational flexibility to absorb market strain, allocate resources dynamically and maintain continuity of performance under pressure. Its hedge fund solutions segment, for example, seeds new strategies, invests in special situations and creates alternative solutions, reflecting an ability to innovate services in response to changing market demands. Blackstone cautions that difficult market and geopolitical conditions, including slowdowns across industries or geographies, could contribute to adverse operating performance for certain fund investments, underscoring the importance of diversified business lines, proactive capital deployment and the pursuit of stable fundamentals to confront unexpected disruptions and preserve organizational health.

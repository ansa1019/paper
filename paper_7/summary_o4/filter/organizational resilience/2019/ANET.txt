Aristaâ€™s cloud networking solutions deliver industry-leading performance, scalability, availability, programmability, automation and visibility, supported by an EOS platform purpose-built to be fully programmable, highly modular and reliable, enabling rapid integration with a wide range of third-party applications for virtualization, management, automation, orchestration and network services and thereby preserving system integrity and performance under varying pressures. The company has been profitable and operating cash flow positive since 2010 and believes its future success depends on continued development of market-leading products and features that address evolving customer requirements, supported by ongoing investments in research and development to enhance functionality, introduce new products and features and build upon its technology leadership. Arista engineers its products to be agnostic to underlying merchant silicon architecture so as to focus R&D resources on core software competencies and leverage vendor investments for cost-effective solutions, and works closely with third-party contract manufacturers and fulfillment partners to perform manufacturing, configuration, quality assurance testing and shipment, providing operational flexibility and resilience in the face of unpredictable demand patterns, supply chain sourcing activities and customer qualification processes. The company continues to expand its sales force, marketing activities and strategic relationships with channel, technology and system-level partners to reach new and existing customers more effectively, increase sales and provide services and support, while managing profitability under pricing pressure, customer concentration and timing variability. With cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.7 billion held for working capital and invested primarily in highly rated securities to minimize principal risk, together with strong cash generation from operations, Arista expects to meet its liquidity requirements and support its growth strategies for at least the next 12 months, demonstrating its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite external disturbances and resource constraints.

In the MD&A, management underscores forward-looking statements and risk assessments intended to provide readers with comprehensive understanding of our businesses, strategies, current trends, and future prospects, thereby supporting the maintenance of functioning and adaptability under challenging conditions. We adopted ASC 606 and ASU 2016-18 requirements, restating prior period amounts to maintain system integrity and performance in our financial reporting. Our growth strategy depends on embracing disruptive technology trends, entering new markets, and driving broad adoption of our products and services, while we invest significant resources in product development, marketing, sales capabilities, and information technology infrastructure, as well as privacy and security capabilities, to mitigate risks and ensure operational continuity. We have implemented additional security measures for our consumer and professional tax offerings and collaborate with state and federal governments to share information regarding suspicious filings, reflecting inter-organizational collaboration and resilience strategies. We exercise significant judgment in revenue recognition, business combinations, goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessments, and uncertain tax positions, comparing carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows and adjusting valuation allowances quarterly, to preserve performance maintenance, resource allocation, and positive adjustment under both nominal and extreme conditions. Our annual goodwill impairment tests have confirmed that estimated fair values exceeded carrying values, demonstrating recovery and system resilience. We review legal proceedings quarterly, assessing potential financial exposure and adjusting accruals based on the best available information, further illustrating risk assessment and operational flexibility. We generated $2.3 billion in cash from operations in fiscal 2019, supplemented by borrowings under secured and unsecured credit facilities, and we apply these resources to capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends, and debt repayments to maintain liquidity, support strategic initiatives, and preserve competitive advantage. Our strong liquidity profile and undrawn revolving credit facility position us to meet seasonal working capital needs, contractual obligations, and commitments for at least the next 12 months, enabling rapid response to external disturbances and ensuring the ongoing performance of our consolidated financial system.

The Charles Schwab Corporation’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis describes a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework and contingency planning process—aligned with the scholarly definition of organizational resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions”—that enables the firm to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under internal or external disturbances. Management outlines a four-step risk management process of identification, assessment, measurement, monitoring and reporting, and mitigation, supported by periodic self-assessments, control testing and internal audit reviews, and overseen by specialized governance committees. To ensure business continuity and operational flexibility regardless of incident duration, Schwab maintains geographically dispersed backup and recovery infrastructure, routine testing of disaster-recovery and incident-management plans, diversified funding arrangements, and contingency funding scenarios. The firm actively manages credit, market, liquidity, operational and compliance risks through policies and procedures including credit limits, margin and collateral requirements, liquidity stress testing, portfolio duration rebalancing in response to interest-rate movements, and a dedicated LIBOR transition team to inventory exposures and establish fallback arrangements. Capital management practices—including regular capital stress tests under adverse macroeconomic and firm-specific scenarios, early-warning indicators, subsidiary dividend and capital transfer guidelines, and a capital contingency plan—seek to maintain regulatory capital buffers and a source of financial strength. Complementary programs for cybersecurity, fraud prevention, third-party risk oversight, model governance, compliance, conduct risk, and fiduciary duties establish controls to mitigate hazards and uphold organizational integrity. Incentive compensation risk oversight aligns employee incentives with prudent risk-taking, while disciplined expense management, strategic acquisitions and ongoing investment in technology and campus expansion demonstrate resource allocation aimed at sustaining client services, driving efficiency, and facilitating adaptation and recovery in turbulent markets and exceptional conditions.

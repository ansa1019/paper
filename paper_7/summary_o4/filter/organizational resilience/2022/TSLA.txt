In 2022, despite ongoing supply chain and logistics challenges and factory shutdowns, the Company produced 1,369,611 consumer vehicles and delivered 1,313,851 vehicles and deployed 6.5 GWh of energy storage and 348 MW of solar systems, and it continues to ramp production and build new manufacturing capacity across Fremont, Shanghai, Berlin-Brandenburg and Texas gigafactories while increasing affordability and efficiency through cost innovation and localized procurement. The Company acknowledges uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations—including new product and manufacturing technologies, concurrent international projects, industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages and potential future impacts such as the COVID-19 pandemic—and maintains operational flexibility by self-funding capital expenditures, adjusting the pace of projects by operating segment, and retaining the ability to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources or repay indebtedness early to ensure adequate liquidity. To mitigate bottlenecks and transportation strain, it has transitioned to a more even regional mix of vehicle builds, increased exports from Shanghai, and plans additional factories near local markets, while expanding and staffing its delivery, servicing and charging infrastructure, optimizing Supercharger locations and maintaining vehicle reliability. In its energy generation and storage segment, the Company commits to growing production to meet high demand, maintains adequate battery cell supply for its products, hires skilled personnel for solar roof installation, and seeks improved installation capability and price efficiencies. The demonstrated ability to generate net positive operating cash flow, adjust working capital through inventory, accounts payable and other liabilities to support production ramps, and continuously evaluate capital and operating expenditures supports the preservation and improvement of its performance under challenging conditions, reflecting the maintenance of positive adjustment and organizational integrity amid internal and external disturbances.

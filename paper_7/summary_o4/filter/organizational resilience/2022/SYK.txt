Stryker’s 2022 Form 10-K disclosures describe a multifaceted approach to preserving organizational performance under adverse conditions by proactively managing inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions and component shortages through actions such as pre-buying critical raw materials, maintaining inventory reserves and employing discretionary cost and headcount discipline to offset higher labor, steel and transportation costs; adapting to shifting external pressures including the Russia-Ukraine conflict by electing to continue operations in Russia where safe and responding to China’s volume-based procurement and import purchase evaluation standards through strategic product portfolio adjustments and market exits; executing a long-term capital allocation strategy that prioritizes acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases—evidenced by the $2.6 billion Vocera acquisition to accelerate digital innovation and diversify the portfolio—and maintaining robust liquidity and operational flexibility via substantial cash generation, global cash management, revolving credit facilities and competitive debt issuances; leveraging non-GAAP measures for trend analysis, management incentives and risk assessment; and rigorously provisioning for product recall liabilities, goodwill impairments and uncertain tax and pension obligations, all of which collectively demonstrate the company’s ability to absorb strain, reconfigure resources and sustain or improve functioning amid evolving macroeconomic, geopolitical and regulatory challenges.

The Company’s management has undertaken strategic actions aimed at maintaining operational continuity and preserving organizational integrity in the face of internal and external pressures, including risk mitigation measures, resource reallocation, and capacity expansion initiatives. As part of its response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company invested in large-scale manufacturing of COVID-19 antibodies at risk, in order to ensure rapid access to patients around the world, and recognized related inventory impairment charges when near-term demand shifted. The Company anticipates and addresses intermittent disruptions in product supply by operationalizing additional internal and contracted manufacturing capacity over the next several years, committing over $2 billion to new facilities in Indiana, more than $1 billion to a facility in North Carolina, and 400 million euro to expand biologics manufacturing in Ireland, as well as a further $450 million to expand parenteral filling and packaging capacity, all of which support its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under extreme conditions. Management continuously evaluates liquidity and capital resources and believes available cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flow, and access to short-term and long-term borrowings are sufficient to fund existing and planned capital requirements—ranging from working capital and capital expenditures to debt repayment and business development activities—thereby reinforcing financial resilience. Through a controlled risk management program, the Company employs derivative instruments to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, and has undertaken compensatory actions to improve retention and address wage inflation, reflecting adaptability to evolving labor market constraints. Research and development spending is managed across a diversified portfolio of approximately 45 late-stage pipeline candidates and numerous discovery projects so that a delay in or termination of any single project does not cause a significant change in total R&D spending, and business development activity—including acquisitions, collaborations, investments, and licensing arrangements—is leveraged to enhance the pipeline and strengthen the enterprise’s adaptive capabilities. These measures collectively reflect a systemic perspective on preserving performance and integrity under challenging conditions, maintaining competitive advantage, and sustaining organizational health amid environmental disturbances, supply chain volatility, and market uncertainties.

Philip Morris International Inc. exemplifies organizational resilience—defined as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions—through sustained strategic investments exceeding $10.5 billion since 2008 to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products, while building world-class scientific assessment capabilities in pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research and post-market studies. In November 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match AB, creating a global smoke-free combination led by the IQOS and ZYN brands, reclassifying certain products into a newly created smoke-free category without affecting consolidated segment reporting, and in January 2023 reorganized its operations from six to four geographical segments—and relocated its corporate headquarters from New York to Stamford—to reinforce consumer centricity, accelerate the speed of innovation and deployment, and enhance operational flexibility. In response to the war in Ukraine, PMI prioritized the safety and security of more than 1,300 employees by facilitating evacuations and relocations, providing critical aid and in-kind support, continuing salary payments, temporarily suspending and subsequently resuming operations where safety allowed, and supplying the market from production centers outside Ukraine via contract manufacturing arrangements, thereby preserving business continuity and reconfiguring resources under duress. Concurrently, PMI scaled down planned investments and suspended product launches in Russia, continuously assessed evolving regulatory constraints and international restrictions, and maintained support for over 3,200 employees while fulfilling legal obligations. Strategic agreements such as the reacquisition of US IQOS commercialization rights from Altria Group Inc., effective May 1, 2024, and a fifteen-year exclusive collaboration with KT&G featuring performance-review cycles to allow flexibility for evolving market conditions, further demonstrate PMI’s capacity to adapt, mitigate risk and reconfigure resource allocation in the face of environmental disruptions. Despite adverse impacts from currency fluctuations, asset impairments, exit costs, war-related charges of $151 million in 2022, amortization and impairment of intangibles and transaction-related expenses, PMI reported net revenues of $31.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, reflecting favorable volume/mix and pricing variances and preserving its performance integrity amid internal and external disturbances.

Management acknowledges forward‐looking statements based on current plans, expectations and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties, including widespread macroeconomic uncertainties such as supply chain constraints, inflation, monetary policy shifts, recession risks, the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical conflicts, all of which management continues to actively monitor for their impact on the company’s financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers and workforce. The company has experienced unpredictability in the timing and concentration of orders from large end customers due to changes in demand patterns, the time required for product evaluation and qualification and the complexity of large orders, and accordingly anticipates continued variability in customer concentration and sales timing. To absorb strain and preserve operational performance under supply chain disruptions, Arista has extended its demand planning horizon, funded additional working capital and incremental purchase commitments, increased material and logistics investments, worked closely with contract manufacturers and supply chain partners to ramp production and meet customer demand, and recorded provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and contract manufacturer liabilities based on ongoing demand forecasts and vendor execution assessments. Although some improvements in manufacturing and supply chain operations were realized in late 2022, constraints continue to impact timely product fulfillment and gross margins, prompting the company to maintain higher levels of purchase commitments and inventory and to evaluate non-cancellable obligations in the context of updated forecasts. The company’s future success therefore depends on its ability to continue to evolve and adapt to a rapidly changing environment by investing in research and development to enhance and expand its EOS software and cloud networking platform (whose programmability allows rapid expansion of software applications for workflow automation, network visibility, analytics and detection and response and integration with a wide range of third-party applications), by expanding sales, marketing and service support globally, and by leveraging agnostic, programmable software core competencies to achieve cost-effective solutions. Arista believes its existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund working capital requirements, growth strategies and material cash obligations for at least the next twelve months; however, the company recognizes that future capital requirements will depend on factors such as growth rate, R&D and sales and marketing spending, supply chain activities, strategic investments or acquisitions and market acceptance. Furthermore, the company applies significant judgment in forecasting demand, evaluating revenue recognition, valuing inventory and assessing tax positions, acknowledging that adverse deviations in market demand, supplier performance, pricing pressures or tax outcomes could materially affect its financial performance and necessitate further resource reallocation, risk mitigation and resilience strategies to maintain integrity and performance under challenging conditions.

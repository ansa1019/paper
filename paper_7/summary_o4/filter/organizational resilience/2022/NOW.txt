The Company highlights a range of strategies and capabilities that contribute to its organizational resilience, including the transformation to digital operations via the Now Platform, which increases customersâ€™ resiliency and security and delivers additional value to employees and consumers; continuous monitoring of external disruptions such as the evolving Russia-Ukraine conflict, with ongoing risk assessment and contingency planning to preserve business continuity; the generation of positive operating cash flows for more than ten years and the use of free cash flow as a key non-GAAP metric to indicate the strength and performance of business operations; maintenance of liquidity through cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2022 to meet working capital requirements and fund operations for at least the next 12 months; mitigation of foreign currency exchange risks via short-term derivative contracts to reduce the impact of adverse currency movements; evaluation of noncancelable purchase commitments and operating lease obligations to manage resource commitments over varying maturities; and ongoing investments in data center capacity, public cloud offerings for regulated markets and targeted acquisitions to expand technological capabilities, all of which reflect deliberate resource deployment, risk mitigation, operational flexibility and strategic foresight under challenging and uncertain conditions.

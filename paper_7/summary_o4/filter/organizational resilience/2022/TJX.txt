The Company’s proactive resource allocation and operational flexibility are reflected in forward-looking statements regarding future financial performance made pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act safe harbor and subject to identified risk factors and uncertainties, including those described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, and other SEC filings, demonstrating risk assessment and strategic foresight. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company adapted its comparable store sales definition to report open-only comp store sales and reverted to the historical comp store sales methodology for fiscal 2023, thereby preserving meaningful performance metrics under exceptional conditions. Investments in supply chain and mark-to-market hedging of inventory-related foreign currency exposures mitigate earnings volatility from external disturbances, while enhanced liquidity management—maintaining $5.5 billion in cash, $1.5 billion of available credit facilities and internally generated funds—supports operating needs and capital deployment strategies, including anticipated repayments of indebtedness, planned capital expenditures of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion for offices, distribution centers, store renovations and new stores, and the execution of a $2 billion to $2.5 billion stock repurchase program based on excess cash flow, market conditions and legal requirements. Risk management processes encompass critical accounting estimates for inventory valuation under the retail method, reserves for uncertain tax positions and contingencies for loss assessments with legal counsel, all of which support system integrity and enable the maintenance of performance under pressure through adaptive strategies in financing, operations and governance.

Bank of America’s management underscores the importance of maintaining business continuity and operational flexibility under challenging conditions, recognizing that sound risk management enables the corporation to serve its customers and deliver for its shareholders and that, if not managed well, risk can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and reputational damage that could impair the organization’s ability to execute its strategic objectives. The corporation implements a comprehensive risk framework approved annually by the enterprise risk committee and the board, defining roles and responsibilities, articulating risk-appetite limits and deploying proprietary capital-allocation models to measure and mitigate credit, market, operational, strategic and liquidity risks. Management conducts forward-looking stress testing and an internal capital adequacy assessment process to assess resilience under adverse economic scenarios, and maintains contingency funding plans, capital contingency and recovery plans, and a resolution plan to prepare for and respond to liquidity stress events. Liquidity risk management focuses on meeting expected and unexpected cash-flow and collateral requirements under a range of conditions, holding a global liquidity buffer of high-quality, unencumbered assets and testing contingency funding approaches, including Federal Reserve facilities and central bank programs. Strategic risk is integrated into the annual strategic planning process, with senior management allocating capital and setting performance targets consistent with risk capacity and appetite, while governance structures provide ongoing oversight of plan execution, capital actions, acquisitions, divestitures and the risk implications of new initiatives. Operational resiliency is supported by a multi-layered information-security program, business-continuity policies and three lines of defense for compliance and operational risk—led by business units, global risk management and corporate audit—to prepare for, prevent, detect, mitigate, respond to and recover from cyber threats, system interruptions and external hazards. The corporation also manages reputational risk through embedded policies and controls, remediating issues to minimize damage and engaging in stakeholder communication strategies. As part of environmental resilience, climate-related physical and transition risks are embedded into the enterprise risk framework, overseen by governance committees and a dedicated climate-risk council, to identify, measure, monitor and control exposures to changing physical climates and a low-carbon transition and to meet public targets, including net-zero financing commitments and emissions-reduction objectives by 2030.

Blackstone’s annual report describes the firm’s and the broader economy’s ability to maintain functionality under challenging macroeconomic pressures, noting that despite monetary policy tightening, inflation and market volatility, economic growth, employment and retail sales “demonstrated resilience” and that credit markets benefited from floating-rate exposures. To preserve business continuity and operational flexibility, Blackstone extended its revolving credit facility, issued long-term senior notes and managed its liquidity through diversified funding sources including cash flows, note proceeds and liquid investments. The firm highlights its systematic resource allocation across four segments, extensive dry powder for future investment, and the use of non-GAAP measures to assess performance under stress. It also characterizes adaptation in product mix and fee structures—expanding perpetual capital vehicles, co-investment capabilities and diversified fee-earning offerings—to mitigate external disturbances, maintain integration of core operations and secure competitive advantage amid turbulent markets and uncertainty.

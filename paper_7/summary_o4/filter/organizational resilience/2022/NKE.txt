Through the consumer direct acceleration, Nike has undertaken a comprehensive organizational realignment—streamlining leadership and operating models, reducing its global workforce and reinvesting expected annual wage-related savings—to build a profitable global portfolio capable of faster strategic execution; it has aligned product creation and category organizations around a new consumer construct and continues to invest in data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering, inventory management and an end-to-end technology foundation to accelerate digital transformation, drive speed and responsiveness and preserve functioning under rapid market change. In response to COVID-19—a major external shock that disrupted its supply chain through factory shutdowns, elevated transit times and higher transportation and logistics costs—Nike maintained business continuity by keeping nearly all owned stores and supplier operations open, recording a 23 percent increase in inventories of in-transit product, and deploying its operational playbook of balancing inventory across geographies, pricing actions and a seasonless product approach to mitigate margin pressures and sustain product availability despite volatility. To address currency, liquidity and financing risks, management centrally hedges transactional and translational foreign exchange exposures using forward contracts and options to lessen the effects of exchange-rate fluctuations on consolidated results, maintains committed credit facilities and a commercial paper program, and expects existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows from operations to fund capital expenditures (approximately 3 percent of annual revenues), share repurchases and strategic initiatives. These measures—spanning resource reallocation, proactive risk mitigation, operational flexibility, strategic technology investments and hedging practices—support Nike’s ability to absorb strain, preserve or improve performance under challenging conditions and maintain organizational integrity and growth trajectory amid ongoing external pressures.

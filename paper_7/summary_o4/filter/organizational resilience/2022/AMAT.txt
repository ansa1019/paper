Applied responded promptly to the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing global precautionary measures to preserve health, safety and compliance, supporting workplace flexibility and adjusting operations in collaboration with employees, customers and suppliers under fluid conditions, while prioritizing the mitigation of supply chain constraints to maintain production and shipments. The company’s long-term resilience strategy involves significant resource allocation to research, development and engineering, enabling timely introduction of innovative materials and equipment to address technology inflections and evolving customer requirements, and ensuring manufacturing capacity and operational flexibility. Applied closely manages its financial resilience through diversified liquidity sources, including cash flows from operations, accounts receivable sales, committed revolving credit facilities, short-term commercial paper programs, and disciplined capital deployment via dividends and share repurchases. It also maintains robust risk management practices—monitoring credit exposure, assessing inventory obsolescence, managing warranty obligations and evaluating off-balance-sheet guarantees—to preserve system integrity and performance under nominal and disruptive conditions. Management believes these measures collectively support the organization’s ability to absorb strain, reconfigure resources and maintain or improve functioning in the face of external pressures, thereby reinforcing business continuity and competitive strength.

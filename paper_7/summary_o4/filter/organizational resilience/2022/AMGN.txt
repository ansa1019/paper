In 2022, Amgen continued providing uninterrupted supplies of its medicines globally through the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic while maintaining a strategic and disciplined approach to capital allocation and advancing its ESG efforts, thereby demonstrating its ability to absorb strain and preserve operations under exceptional conditions. The company has been closely monitoring the pandemic’s effects on its global operations, taking steps to minimize risks to employees through remote working arrangements that have not significantly affected its ability to maintain critical business operations or supply of medicines, and continuously monitoring infection rates, mitigating effects on clinical trial enrollment and evaluating impacts across relevant countries. Consistent with the objective of optimizing its capital structure, Amgen deploys accumulated cash balances strategically—investing in innovation both internally and externally, pursuing strategic transactions, repaying debt, paying dividends and repurchasing stock through various mechanisms such as block purchases, tender offers and accelerated share repurchases—to enhance financial resilience and operational flexibility. The company believes that existing funds, cash generated from operations and access to financing sources including marketable securities, commercial paper, revolving credit facilities and other debt markets are adequate to satisfy working capital, capital expenditure, debt service and strategic acquisition needs, and it manages uncertain future obligations through operational budgeting, thereby allocating resources under uncertainty. Amgen’s approach to human capital resource management—directed at attracting, motivating, developing and retaining talent to tackle enterprise challenges—along with compensation, benefits and development programs designed to encourage performance, accountability and adherence to company values, and a diverse and inclusive culture that fosters innovation, supports its competitive position and organizational capabilities. Operating cash flows have been and are expected to remain the primary recurring source of funds, underscoring its capacity to maintain performance and navigate external pressures.

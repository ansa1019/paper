Starbucks’ fiscal 2022 results demonstrate “the resiliency and strength of our brand,” with consolidated revenues increasing 11% to $32.3 billion despite COVID-19 related restrictions in multiple cities, and North America comparable store sales rising 12%. Under our U.S. reinvention plan, management has increased investments in partner wages and enhanced training to drive retention and productivity while accelerating purpose-built store concepts and innovations in technologies to elevate the partner and customer experience and provide additional convenience and connection. Management employs new store openings, comparable store sales and margin management as key operating metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies. The company actively manages its cash and investments to internally fund operating needs, service interest and principal on borrowings, pursue strategic acquisitions and return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases—resuming its repurchase program in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 after a temporary suspension to augment investments in stores and partners—and believes that net future cash flows combined with available balance sheet capacity will be sufficient to support capital requirements and sustain operations under adverse conditions. We regularly review our cash positions and the indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings to assess liquidity and potential tax implications. To mitigate market-based risks, Starbucks adheres to a market price risk management policy that establishes annual risk limits and prohibits speculative trading, and employs pricing features embedded in supply contracts, fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts, interest rate swaps, treasury locks, cross-currency swaps and commodity hedges to manage exposures to commodity price volatility, foreign currency fluctuations and interest rate changes. Despite inflationary pressures on commodities and supply chain constraints, the company expects benefits from strategic pricing decisions, increased sales leverage and higher productivity driven by the reinvention plan to offset such impacts. Absent significant and prolonged COVID-19 relapses or global economic disruptions, management is confident in the strength of the Starbucks brand and its strategy for sustainable, profitable growth over the long term.

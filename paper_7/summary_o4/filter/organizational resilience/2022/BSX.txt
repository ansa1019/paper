We acknowledge significant external pressures, including inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, monetary policy changes, tax law changes, geopolitical dynamics and supply chain constraints, which have led to increased costs, limited availability of critical inputs, wage inflation and distribution delays, and we expect these macroeconomic conditions to continue; during the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent variants, we have maintained that our long-term fundamentals remain strong and intend to manage through these challenges with strategic focus and the winning spirit of our global team; to support business continuity and operational flexibility, we reorganized our structure and implemented a global supply chain network optimization and functional capability build-out through the 2019 restructuring plan (extended in 2021) and committed to a further 2023 restructuring plan to align resources with strategic imperatives, simplify manufacturing and distribution networks, achieve cost synergies, sustain growth and strengthen resilience; we proactively manage regulatory change—incurring and planning for significant implementation costs associated with EU MDR requirements—and maintain liquidity and resource resiliency through diversified cash and cash equivalents, a committed revolving credit facility, prudent short-term investments, inventory and working-capital management and strategic planning for future capital needs; our risk mitigation framework includes robust cybersecurity controls, escalation procedures for enterprise-level issues, crisis response protocols and board-level reporting to preserve system integrity and organizational resilience; and we continue to invest in research and development, energy management and environmental sustainability initiatives—including a commitment to carbon neutrality—to enhance our adaptive capabilities, operational continuity and long-term resilience against environmental, market and regulatory disruptions.

On April 1, 2020, we completed the merger with Sprint and, as a combined company, have been able to enhance the breadth and depth of our nationwide 5G network, accelerate innovation, increase competition in the U.S. wireless and broadband industries and achieve significant synergies and cost reductions by eliminating redundancies within the combined network as well as other business processes and operations.  Network integration as of December 31, 2022, has included the decommissioning of substantially all Sprint macro sites targeted for shutdown, the acceleration or termination of certain operating and financing leases for cell sites, switch sites and network equipment, and rationalization activities to identify duplicative networks, backhaul services and other agreements, in addition to decommissioning small cell sites and distributed antenna systems; in conjunction with these efforts, we retired legacy Sprint CDMA and LTE networks in the second and third quarters of 2022, respectively.  Upon closing the merger, we began implementing restructuring initiatives to realize cost efficiencies through contract terminations, severance costs, the reduction of redundant processes and functions, and the decommissioning of network assets, and we expect to realize merger synergies by eliminating redundancies within our combined network as well as other business processes, including reductions in selling, general and administrative and cost of service expenses and avoided network expenditures.  The retirement of the legacy Sprint CDMA and LTE networks also triggered an assessment of wireline long-lived assets for impairment, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $477 million during 2022, and on September 6, 2022, we entered into a wireline sale agreement for a total purchase price of $1, which led us to conclude that the wireline business met held-for-sale criteria and recognize a pre-tax loss of $1.1 billion; the fair value of the disposal group, less costs to sell, will be reassessed and any remeasurement to lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell will be recorded as an adjustment.  In August 2021, we were subject to a criminal cyberattack involving unauthorized access to our systems, recorded a $400 million pre-tax charge in June 2022 and expect to incur additional expenses to remediate the attack, resolve governmental inquiries, provide customer support and enhance customer protection; in addition to a committed incremental spend of $150 million for data security and related technology in 2022 and 2023 under the proposed settlement agreement, we intend to allocate substantial additional resources towards multi-year cybersecurity initiatives and transform our approach to cybersecurity in future periods.  Macroeconomic trends may result in adverse impacts on our business, and we continue to monitor risks such as economic recession, changes in the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and geopolitical events, including the war in Ukraine, as these scenarios may affect expected credit loss activity and fair value estimates, and we regularly monitor trends’ impacts on customer payment performance.  Our principal sources of liquidity—cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, proceeds from debt issuances, financing leases, the sale of receivables and our revolving credit facility—are expected to be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements and anticipated payments associated with our restructuring initiatives, and, excluding liquidity needed for spectrum acquisitions, other long-lived assets or potential stockholder returns, we expect these sources will cover our business operations for the next 12 months and longer term; our intended use of any such funds includes capital expenditures, spectrum purchases, opportunistic investments and acquisitions, debt redemption, tower obligations, share repurchases and execution of our integration plan.  We have entered into uncommitted financing lease facilities with third parties providing commitments of up to $7.5 billion for network equipment and services—$1.2 billion of which was executed in 2022—and expect to enter into up to an additional $1.2 billion in financing lease commitments during 2023.  Our liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses, the construction, expansion and upgrading of our network infrastructure and the integration of the networks, spectrum, technology, personnel and customer base of T-Mobile and Sprint, and future capital expenditures will include deployment of our recently acquired C-band and 3.45 GHz spectrum licenses.

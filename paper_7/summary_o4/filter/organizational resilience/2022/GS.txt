Management’s discussion and analysis discloses that the firm maintains “a comprehensive and conservative set of liquidity and funding policies” designed “to be able to fund ourselves and to enable our core businesses to continue to serve clients and generate revenues, even under adverse circumstances,” including the pre-funding of estimated cash and collateral needs in a crisis by holding “global core liquid assets” comprised of unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash. It describes a rigorous balance sheet management process built on “balance sheet planning,” “balance sheet limits,” monitoring of key metrics and “scenario analyses,” together with diversified secured and unsecured funding and a contingency funding plan “to provide a framework for analyzing and responding to a liquidity crisis situation or periods of market stress,” which outlines potential risk factors, assigns responsibility for execution and identifies mitigants and action items. The enterprise risk management framework employs integrated governance from the board and senior management through dedicated committees; conducts firmwide stress tests, sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses over short- and long-term horizons; and incorporates a “triggers and alerts framework” to support recovery and resolution planning. The firm emphasizes dynamic asset-liability management, diversified and term-appropriate funding, and independent price verification and collateral arrangements to mitigate market, credit and funding risks, while its operational resilience program encompasses “business continuity planning,” regular testing, up-to-date policies, process-level controls, error reporting and control self-assessments to capture risk events and drive improvements. Model risk is managed through independent review, annual validation and adherence to development standards, and broader resilience is reinforced by monitoring of third-party, cybersecurity and climate risks, a culture of escalation and accountability, and ongoing integration of lessons learned to preserve system integrity and maintain performance under stress.

In 2022, Prologis demonstrated its ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions by delivering robust operating results and ending the year in a solid financial position despite headwinds from volatile capital markets, persistent inflation, rising interest rates and the war-driven energy crisis in Europe. The company absorbed strain through disciplined capital deployment, focusing on build-to-suit developments while pausing contributions to open-ended funds and preserving remaining liquidity of $4.1 billion, including $3.9 billion of undrawn credit capacity and $278 million of unrestricted cash at year-end. By terminating its 2019 global facility, entering a new $3.0 billion facility and upsizing its 2021 facility to $2.0 billion, Prologis increased its aggregate borrowing capacity to $5.0 billion, extended debt maturities and transitioned to SOFR-based pricing, thereby mitigating refinancing and interest-rate risks. The assumption and strategic repayment of $4.2 billion of Duke debt, along with the issuance of $3.3 billion of senior notes—including green bonds—further exemplifies the firm’s resource reconfiguration and proactive risk management. Operational flexibility and continuity were evidenced by 98.2 percent portfolio occupancy, retention of over 70 percent of customers, and 48.0 percent net effective rent change on new leases, which together underpinned significant same-store NOI increases while allowing the firm to absorb market perturbations. Prologis actively manages foreign exchange and interest-rate exposures through currency-matched borrowings and designated net investment hedges, recognizing derivative gains that offset translation losses, thereby preserving system integrity and performance. Its diversified cash-flow sources—rental revenues, strategic-capital fees and co-investment venture distributions—along with prudent capex allocation to sustainable building improvements, reflect an adaptive, forward-looking approach to capital planning, risk assessment and organizational resilience.

In 2022, UPS navigated a challenging operating environment marked by global inflation, rising interest rates, recessionary forecasts, wage and labor market pressures, geopolitical uncertainties and foreign currency fluctuations, as well as COVID-19 lockdowns in China that disrupted both manufacturing and supply chains, negatively impacting demand and increasing operating costs. Despite these pressures, management’s strategic execution strengthened the balance sheet and generated strong cash flows, enabling the retirement of $2.0 billion of debt, reinvestment in the business and the return of cash to shareowners through dividends and share repurchases. The company shifted its strategic framework to “better and bolder” by enhancing customer engagement through combining its integrated global network with digital capabilities to drive new services, while simultaneously increasing efficiencies and maintaining disciplined capital allocation. To bolster its operational flexibility and resource generation, UPS completed the acquisition of Delivery Solutions—a digital platform that optimizes customer deliveries across multiple networks—and the acquisition of Bomi Group, expanding its healthcare logistics footprint and cold chain expertise. Ongoing productivity initiatives, periodic refinements to activity-based costing methods and continued network adjustments were employed to mitigate volume declines, manage higher fuel prices and offset inflationary pressures on compensation, benefits and facility costs. Anticipating continued uncertainty related to union labor agreement negotiations, volume and rate fluctuations, fuel surcharge variability and macroeconomic headwinds, UPS expects to fund material short- and long-term cash requirements—including planned capital expenditures (approximately $5.3 billion in 2023), pension contributions, transformation strategy costs and debt obligations—primarily through cash from operations, marketable securities and access to liquidity options. The company also regularly evaluates its capital structure, updates estimates of residual values for aircraft such as the fully depreciated MD-11 fleet to reflect operational plans, and applies rigorous risk assessment processes for self-insurance reserves and uncertain tax positions, all to preserve or improve functioning under internal and external disturbances, maintain system integrity and support sustained performance under pressure.

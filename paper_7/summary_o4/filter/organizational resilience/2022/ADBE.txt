In evaluating our financial condition and results, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates based on historical experience and various reasonable factors and regularly reevaluate these estimates to ensure our ability to maintain operational continuity and adapt under varying internal and external pressures.  We fulfill our promise of an end-to-end solution by integrating cloud-based and on-premise features that together preserve functionality and performance even under adverse customer environments.  We continuously monitor macroeconomic events such as foreign currency fluctuations, central bank actions, the Russia-Ukraine war and the COVID-19 pandemic, and deploy mitigation strategies—halting sales in impacted regions, reducing and revaluing annualized recurring revenue balances, and executing foreign-currency hedging—to protect our predictable revenue streams.  We allocate resources through sustained investments in research and development, hosting services, data center capacity, professional fees and targeted acquisitions of complementary workflow platforms, and we reconfigure our product portfolio via rigorous purchase price allocations and integration of intangible assets to maintain competitive advantage and systemic resilience.  Our liquidity and capital resource management—including cash, short- and long-term investments, a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, senior notes without financial covenants and structured share repurchase agreements—provides the financial flexibility to absorb strain, reconstitute trajectories of future growth and preserve organizational health amid uncertainty.  These structured risk assessments, resource deployments, strategic acquisitions and continuous scenario planning reflect our multifaceted approach to sustaining performance, preserving system integrity and achieving positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

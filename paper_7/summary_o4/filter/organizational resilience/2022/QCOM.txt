Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis acknowledges that our operations entail forward‐looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties, necessitating ongoing risk assessment and mitigation to maintain performance under challenging conditions. We have organized our business into QCT, QTL, QSI and other segments to deploy resources dynamically, support operational flexibility and manage fluctuations in consumer demand driven by device launch and industrial cycles. To preserve production continuity amid supply‐chain constraints, we made $2.3 billion in advanced payments to wafer suppliers under multi-year capacity commitments and expect a significant decrease in such upfront obligations as market conditions evolve. In the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we recorded a $1.1 billion benefit and a $62 million interest reversal following the annulment of a €997 million fine, demonstrating our capacity to absorb strain and adapt our financial posture. We funded the $4.7 billion acquisition of Veoneer almost entirely in cash and repurchased $3.1 billion of common stock, reflecting strategic reconfiguration of capital to sustain growth and competitive advantage. Our $8.2 billion R&D investment—up $856 million year-over-year—underscores our commitment to innovation in 5G and application processor technologies and reinforces our absorptive capacity for external knowledge and technological advancement. Looking ahead, we anticipate continued macroeconomic weakness, customer inventory reductions, supplier price increases, trade and national security tensions and the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; we are aligning our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $6.4 billion, $9.1 billion of operating cash flow and our $4.5 billion unsecured commercial paper and revolving credit facilities to preserve business continuity and organizational health. We continue to devote resources to educate wireless‐industry participants and regulators on the benefits of our licensing programs, while monitoring contingencies in legal, regulatory and tax matters that could materially affect our financial condition. Critical accounting policies for revenue recognition, inventory valuations, investment impairments, goodwill and contingent liabilities reflect our systematic approach to maintaining integrity and partial performance under internal and external pressures.

In 2022, Comcast disclosed that COVID-19 has impacted its businesses in a number of ways, affecting the comparability of periods and resulting in temporary restrictions and closures at its international theme parks, and noted that the continuing effects of COVID-19, together with worsening U.S., European and global economic conditions and consumer sentiment, may adversely impact demand for its products and services over the near to medium term. To sustain operations under such adversity, the company maintains significant availability under its revolving credit facility and commercial paper program to meet short-term liquidity requirements and anticipates using a substantial portion of its cash flows from operating activities to repay debt, fund capital expenditures and intangible assets, invest in business opportunities and return capital to shareholders. Capital expenditures increased 9.2% to $7.6 billion, reflecting increased spending on line extensions, scalable infrastructure, support capital and customer-premise equipment, with plans for 2023 focused on investments to increase network capacity, deliver multigigabit speeds, expand business and residential passings, deploy wireless gateways and continue investment in existing and new theme-park attractions, while acknowledging that future requirements will depend on competition, technology, regulation, capacity needs and potential acquisitions. Management uses adjusted EBITDA as its primary measure to evaluate operational strength and performance, allocate resources and capital across its cable communications, NBCUniversal and Sky segments, and enhance comparability of results by excluding noncash depreciation, amortization and certain charges, believing it useful to understand underlying business trends and support decision making under changing conditions. Programming expenses decreased in 2022 due to a decline in video subscribers, partially offset by contractual rate increases, and the company expects further impacts from rate increases that will be offset by continued declines in residential video customers. Management also expects ongoing declines in voice customers due to competitive pressures and shifting consumption patterns. The company revises its estimates of ultimate revenue for owned film and television content based on theatrical performance, historical relationships and current market trends, and licenses are amortized as programming is used. Segment results illustrate responses to internal and external pressures: theme parks revenue increased 49.3% as operating conditions improved compared to 2021; NBCUniversalâ€™s Peacock grew revenue from $778 million to $2.1 billion amid continued investment in content and marketing; and Sky navigated macroeconomic headwinds, currency translation impacts and changes in sports-rights agreements. In connection with its annual impairment assessment, Comcast recorded goodwill and long-lived asset impairments of $8.6 billion in its Sky segment, reflecting increased discount rates and reduced estimated future cash flows due to macroeconomic conditions, and the company continues to monitor its contractual obligations for programming and production expenses, operating leases and other commitments in order to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity.
